item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capitalized terms herein are defined in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related footnote disclosures 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies  including those related to oil and gas revenues  bad debts  the fair value of derivatives  oil and gas properties  asset retirement obligations  marketable securities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation require significant estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
property  plant and equipment proved reserves are defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price and cost changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates utilized by the company 
the company cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods 
reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by the company s vice president of reservoir engineering who reports directly to the company s chief operating officer 
in addition  because substantially all of the company s proved reserves are pledged as collateral for the senior credit facility  the company s estimates of proved reserves are reviewed twice annually by independent engineers on behalf of each of the eleven banks participating in the senior credit facility 
a similar reserve review is conducted by the banks participating in the great lakes debt facility 
to further ensure the reliability of reserve estimates  the company engages independent petroleum consultants to review the estimates of proved reserves 
during   and  their review covered  and of reserve value  respectively 
the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 
the successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves  which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes 
the company adheres to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs to unproved properties 
the greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold costs 
the costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated as to recoverability  based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management 
the company considers a combination of time and geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs 
unproved properties had a net book value of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties 
as the estimated reserves are adjusted  the depletion expense for a property will change  assuming no change in production volumes or the costs capitalized 
estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property  which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired 
reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to its oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities disclosure in note to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in the estimated reserves are considered changes in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis 
the company monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet to ensure they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when 
table of contents circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of future production  future production costs  future abandonment costs  and future inflation 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas  unfavorable adjustment to reserves  a change in costs  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these factors must be considered when testing a property s carrying value for impairment 
the company cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future 
derivatives the company uses commodity derivative contracts to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility 
the company accounts for its commodity derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
earnings are affected by the ineffective portion of a hedge contract changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price 
ineffective gains or losses are recorded in other revenue while the hedge contract is open and may increase or reverse until settlement of the contract 
this may result in significant volatility to current period income 
for derivatives qualifying as hedges  the effective portion of any changes in fair value is recognized in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income oci and then reclassified to earnings when the transaction is consummated 
this may result in significant volatility in stockholders equity 
the fair value of open hedging contracts is an estimated amount that could be realized upon termination 
the commodity derivatives used by the company include commodity swaps and collars 
while there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising prices may not be captured  management believes the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important 
among these benefits are more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions  the flexibility to enter into long term projects requiring substantial committed capital  smoother and more efficient execution of the company s ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs  more consistent returns on invested capital  and better access to bank and other credit markets 
through great lakes  the company also has interest rate swap agreements to protect against the volatility of variable interest rates under its credit facility 
asset retirement obligations the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations 
the company s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as well as regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
asset retirement obligations are not unique to the company or to the oil and gas industry and in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas 
the company adopted this statement effective january   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets asset retirement obligations or aro 
primarily  the new statement requires the company to record a separate liability for the discounted present value of the company s asset retirement obligations  with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of retirement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
in addition  increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
sfas required a cumulative adjustment to reflect the impact of implementing the statement had the rule been in effect since inception 
the company  therefore  calculated the cumulative accretion expense on the aro liability and the cumulative depletion expense on the corresponding property balance 
the sum of this cumulative expense was compared to 
table of contents the depletion expense originally recorded 
because the historically recorded depletion expense was higher than the cumulative expense calculated under sfas  the difference resulted in a million gain  net of tax  which the company recorded as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on january  deferred taxes the company is subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year  b tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized 
the company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carry forwards and other deductible differences 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when management believes that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized 
in determining deferred tax liabilities  accounting rules require oci to be considered  even though such income loss has not yet been earned 
at year end  deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities by million with million of deferred tax assets related to hedging losses included in oci 
at year end  deferred tax assets exceeded deferred tax liabilities by million with million of deferred tax assets related to deferred hedging losses included in oci 
based on the company s projected profitability and because if prices remain constant  the unrealized hedging losses should be offset in the future by higher realization on our production  no year end valuation allowance was deemed necessary 
the company may be is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions on its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for unresolved tax matters  gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 
contingent liabilities a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable  and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on the input of its legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts 
management monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters and makes its best estimate of when the company should record losses for these based on available information 
bad debt expense the company periodically assesses the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectability 
at ipf  receivables are evaluated quarterly and provisions for uncollectible amounts are established 
such provisions for uncollectible amounts are recorded when management believes that a related receivable is not recoverable based on current estimates of expected discounted cash flows 
revenues the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products and services in the period delivered 
revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products 
a substantial portion of production is sold at prevailing market prices  which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the company s control 
imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have dramatic effects on prices 
political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply  while economic factors can impact demand 
at ipf  payments believed to relate to return are recognized as income 
other the company records a write down of marketable securities when the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary 
third party reimbursements for administrative overhead costs incurred by the company in its role as operator of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce general and administrative expense 
salaries and other employment costs of those employees working on 
table of contents the company s exploration efforts are expensed as exploration expense 
the company does not capitalize general and administrative expenses or interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company spent million on exploration  development and acquisitions 
in december  the company purchased  with borrowings under the senior credit facility  producing oil and gas properties in sterling county  texas for approximately million including million of asset retirement obligations 
bank facility debt increased million in while other debt including trust preferred securities was reduced by million 
at december   the company had  in cash  total assets of million and a debt to capitalization ratio of 
available borrowing capacity on the company s bank lines at december  was million on the senior credit facility and million at great lakes of which million was net to range 
long term debt at december  totaled million and included million of borrowings under the senior credit facility  million under the non recourse great lakes million secured revolving bank facility the great lakes credit facility  million of notes and million of debentures 
at december   the company had a working capital deficit of million which included an unrealized hedging liability of million due to the mark to market of all open hedges 
because payments on this hedging liability are made monthly  and the company will also collect production proceeds to which this hedging relates and the amount should be self funding 
during   shares of common stock were exchanged for  of debentures 
a conversion expense of  was recorded on the exchange 
in addition  million of debentures  million of trust preferred securities and  of notes were repurchased for cash 
also  million of cash and million of the newly issued convertible preferred was exchanged for million of trust preferred securities 
a million gain was recorded  as the securities were retired at a discount 
cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves which is typical in the capital intensive extractive industry 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the company believes that net cash generated from operating activities and unused committed borrowing capacity under the credit facilities combined with the oil and gas price hedges currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near term financial obligations and liquidity needs 
however  long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business 
a material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce the company s ability to fund capital expenditures  reduce debt  meet financial obligations and remain profitable 
the company operates in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks  including  but not limited to  the inherent risks of the search for  development and production of oil and gas  the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry 
the company s ability to expand its reserve base is  in part  dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow  borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures 
the following summarizes the company s contractual financial obligations at december  and their future maturities 
the company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities and refinancing proceeds

b derivative obligations represent net open hedging contracts valued as of december  c this table does not include the liability for the deferred compensation plan since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets 
total long term debt at december   was million 
long term debt of million was subject to floating interest rates of which certain amounts have interest swap agreements and million of debt had a fixed interest rate 
the table below describes the company s required annual fixed interest payments on these debt instruments in thousands annual interest security amount interest payable maturity notes   january  july debentures  february  august cash dividend payments in december  the company announced it would reinstate cash dividends on its common stock at an initial quarterly dividend rate of one cent per share 
the first dividend was paid on january  the convertible preferred is entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends at an annual rate of per share 
the payment of dividends is subject to declaration by the board of directors and depends on earnings  capital expenditures and various other factors 
the table below describes the company s preferred dividend payments in thousands annual dividend security amount dividend payable convertible preferred   quarterly 
table of contents cash flow the company s principal sources of cash are operating cash flow  bank borrowings and at times  issuance of debt and equity securities 
the company s cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices 
as of december   the company has entered into hedging agreements covering bcfe  bcfe and bcfe for  and  respectively 
the million of capital expenditures for  excluding acquisitions  was funded with internal cash flow 
the amount expended replaced of production 
including acquisitions  reserve replacement totaled of production 
the million capital budget  which excludes acquisitions  is expected to increase production and to expand the reserve base 
based on current projections  oil and gas futures prices and the company s hedge position  the capital program is expected to be funded with internal cash flow 
net cash provided by operations in  and was million  million and million respectively 
in  cash flow from operations increased with higher volumes and higher prices somewhat offset by increasing operating and exploration expenses 
in  cash flow from operations decreased due to lower prices and volumes  higher exploration and higher general and administrative expenses 
this decrease was somewhat offset by lower interest and direct operating expenses

historically  sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings 
during  recourse bank debt increased million primarily due to the december acquisition of producing properties in the conger field 
for the year  total debt declined million 
during  the company redeemed million of the trust preferred securities and million of the notes and issued million of notes 
during  recourse bank debt increased million and total debt including trust preferred securities decreased by million 
recourse debt increased due to the retirement of the ipf credit facility and the repurchase of debt and convertible securities with borrowings under the senior credit facility 
during  recourse bank debt increased by million and total debt including trust preferred securities decreased by million 
the reduction in debt was the result of applying excess internal cash flow  proceeds from asset sales and exchanges of common stock for debt and convertible securities 
capital requirements the company s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends 
during  million of capital was expended  primarily on drilling projects 
also during  million was expended on acquisitions  including million to purchase producing properties 
the capital program  excluding acquisitions  was funded by of net cash flow from operations 
the capital budget of million is expected to increase production and expand the reserve base by more than replacing production 
development and exploration activities are highly discretionary  and  for the foreseeable future  management expects such activities to be maintained at levels equal to or below internal cash flow 
to the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow  debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements 

table of contents bank credit facilities the company maintains two separate revolving credit facilities  a million senior credit facility and a million great lakes credit facility of which is consolidated by the company 
each facility is secured by substantially all the borrowers assets and matures on january  the great lakes credit facility is non recourse to the company 
as great lakes is owned  half of its borrowings are consolidated in the company s financial statements 
availability under the facilities is subject to borrowing bases set by the banks semi annually and in certain other circumstances 
the borrowing bases are dependent on a number of factors  primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows 
redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of of the lenders  increases require unanimous approval 
at february   the senior credit facility had a million borrowing base of which million was available 
the great lakes credit facility  half of which is consolidated by the company  had a million borrowing base of which million was available 
restrictions on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined are imposed under the company s bank credit agreement and the notes 
under the senior credit facility  common and preferred dividends are permitted 
the terms of the notes limit restricted payments including dividends to the greater of million or a formula based on earnings since the issuance of the notes 
the senior credit facility provides for a restricted payment basket of million plus of net income excluding great lakes plus of distributions  dividends or payments of debt from or proceeds from sales of equity interests of great lakes plus of net cash proceeds from common stock issuances 
the debt agreements contain covenants relating to net worth  working capital  dividends and financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  hedging oil and gas prices the company enters into hedging agreements to reduce the impact of oil and gas price volatility on its operations 
at december   hedges were in place covering bcf of gas at prices averaging per mcf  million barrels of oil at prices averaging per barrel and million barrels of ngls at prices averaging per barrel 
the company also has collars covering bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of to and million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of to 
the hedges fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination  based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  approximated a pretax loss of million at december  the contracts expire monthly through december transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold

table of contents interest rates at december   the company had million of debt outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
senior debt and non recourse debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  which averaged at year end  excluding interest rate swaps 
at december   great lakes had million subject to interest rate swap agreements  of which is consolidated by the company 
these swaps consist of two agreements totaling million at which expire in may  two agreements totaling million at which expire in december  one agreement for million at which expires in june and two agreements totaling million at which expire in june the day libor rate on december  was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost the company approximately million in additional annual interest  net of swaps 
capital restructuring program the company took a number of steps beginning in to strengthen its financial position 
these steps included the sale of assets and the exchange of common stock for debt and convertible securities 
these initiatives have helped reduce total debt from million at december  to million at december  the company currently believes it has sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet its obligations for the next twelve months  however  a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves would reduce the company s ability to fund capital expenditures and meet its financial obligations 
also  the company s obligations may change due to acquisitions  divestitures and continued growth 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to its financial position or results of operations 
inflation and changes in prices the company s revenues  the value of its assets  its ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
during  the company received an average of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas after hedging 
during  the company received an average of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas  after hedging 
although certain of the company s costs and expenses are affected by the general inflation  inflation does not normally have a significant effect on the company 
however  industry specific inflationary pressures built up over an month period in and due to favorable conditions in the industry 
during  the company experienced a slight decline in certain drilling and operational costs when compared to the prior year and in there were slight increases in these costs 
the company expects an increase in these costs for increases in commodity prices can cause inflationary pressures specific to the industry to also increase 
future trends the company s strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves  production  cash flow and earnings per share through a balanced program that involves enhancing and increasing the base of existing properties  developing existing acreage position  investing in high potential exploration prospects  and acquiring producing properties complementary to existing properties 
the company has announced a million capital budget excluding acquisitions 
range will continue to monitor commodity prices and adjust its capital expenditures accordingly 
the company will also continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities should they become available at reasonable prices 
a major trend over the past two decades has involved the divestiture of oil and gas properties located in the united states by major integrated oil companies and large independents 
these companies have largely pursued growth internationally to achieve the size and economies of scale required of a large global enterprise and have sold or deemphasized older smaller properties in the united states 
many of these divested properties have not received significant recent capital 
table of contents investment and often newly available production and reserve enhancement technology has not been applied to these properties 
in other situations  to increase cash flow without increasing capital spending  companies have allowed smaller firms such as range the opportunity to explore and develop reserves on their undeveloped acreage through joint ventures 
the pace of these initiatives by the large independents and major integrated oil companies has slowed significantly during the past five years as oil and gas price increases have improved the underlying economics of older properties 
it is anticipated that as oil and gas prices plateau or decline and extraction costs continue to rise  larger oil companies will implement additional property divestitures and entertain additional joint ventures 
this trend would increase the availability of acquisition  exploration and development opportunities for the company 
should this trend not continue  the company will continue to rely upon the ability of its technical teams to generate exploration and development prospects on existing company owned acreage and acreage publicly available for lease 
another major trend in the industry involves technological advances that reduce the cost to explore and produce oil and gas and also allow for extraction of oil and gas from reservoirs previously deemed unrecoverable 
examples of this technology include d seismic  hydraulic reservoir fracture stimulation  advances in well logging and analysis  horizontal drilling and completion techniques  secondary and tertiary recovery practices  and automated well monitoring and control devices 
these technology advances have served to lower exploration risk  reduce drilling and production costs and  on occasion  dramatically increase the amount of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves from existing reservoirs 
while it is impossible to predict the continuation  pace and application of this trend to the company s properties  the company s large acreage position  experienced staff and geographically diversified property base  positions the company well for future technological advances

table of contents overview the business of exploring for  developing  and acquiring oil and gas is highly competitive and capital intensive 
as in any commodity business  the market price of the commodity produced and the costs associated with finding  acquiring  extracting  and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for shareholders 
generating growth while containing costs represents an ongoing challenge for management  made particularly urgent by the natural production and reserve decline associated with oil and gas properties 
during periods of historically high oil and gas prices  cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services 
other challenges faced by the company include attracting and retaining qualified personnel and maintaining access to capital on sufficiently favorable terms 
enrollments in university oil and gas technology programs have declined over the past two decades as the industry has been wracked by business cycles and consolidation 
emerging industries  such as high technology  have increased the competition for favorably priced capital required by the oil and gas industry 
the company has responded to these trends and challenges in many ways 
the balance sheet has been restructured to increase cash flow available for investment through reduced debt  principal maturity extensions  and lower interest expense 
the technical staff of the company has been increased and strengthened through the hiring of additional experienced professionals and the use of teams 
the inventory of exploration and development prospects has been increased to provide greater diversification of technical risk and better efficiency 
the company s multidiscipline technical teams have local expertise in their area of operation 
this technical competence and local expertise provides a platform to compete and grow core areas from exploration  development and acquisitions 
the year ended december  was very good operationally 
production for the company increased versus the prior year 
range replaced of production at per mcfe finding and development costs through a combination of both successful drilling and acquisition programs 
the production replacement caused the company s reserve base to increase to bcfe as of december  the company completed the acquisition of producing properties in the conger field in sterling county  texas on december  with this acquisition  the company became the largest operator in the field with current net production of mmcfe per day and an acreage position of  gross acres 
as a result of this acquisition  coupled with our ongoing drilling program  production is projected to increase over the drilling inventory consists of a large number of low risk locations  coupled with projects that have higher risk and have the potential to positively impact the company s reserves and production if successful 
the inventory is also geographically diversified with projects in each of the three core areas southwest  gulf coast  and appalachia 
our strategy calls for our baseline growth to be generated through drilling and for the acquisition of producing properties to provide incremental growth 
comparison of to the year brought favorable operating and financial results  even though the company realized a million reduction in oil and gas revenue due to oil and gas hedging 
on the operating side  oil and gas prices  production and proved reserves were all higher than a complementary acquisition adjacent to an existing company owned property was completed in december with the transition from an acquisition focused strategy to a drilling based strategy coupled with complementary acquisitions  brought an increase in both acreage and seismic spending 
on the financial side  enhancing the company s financial position continued with retirement of the trust preferred securities  refinancing of the notes  and a sizable proved reserve driven increase in the senior credit facility borrowing base 
debt carrying costs were reduced and maturities extended  increasing cash flow available for capital investment 
the balance sheet enhancement also resulted in several large revenue and expense items related to the various transactions 
net income in totaled million compared to million in a million gain on retirement of debt and convertible securities was realized in versus million in total oil and gas revenues of million were million higher than due to higher production and a increase in average prices to per mcfe 
the average prices received for oil increased to per barrel and increased to per mcf for gas 
production expenses increased million to million as a result of higher workover costs and increased costs from acquisitions and new wells 
production taxes increased million to million due to higher prices and higher volumes 
since production taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices  higher 
table of contents market prices caused production taxes per mcfe to increase from the prior year 
operating cost excluding production and ad valorem taxes per mcfe produced averaged in versus in transportation and gathering revenues of million were approximately the same as ipf s income of million declined from due to a declining portfolio balance 
during  ipf expenses included million of administrative expenses   of interest and a million increase in the valuation allowance 
during  ipf expense included million of administrative costs   of interest costs and a million increase to the valuation allowance 
other revenue increased from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the period included million of ineffective hedging losses 
the period included million ineffective hedging losses and a million write down of marketable securities  offset by a  arbitration recovery 
exploration expense increased to million in primarily due to higher seismic purchases million offset by lower dry hole costs million 
general and administrative expenses increased due to a million increase in the non cash mark to market deferred compensation expense and million of higher salary and related benefit costs as well as higher director fees  legal and consulting fees and insurance costs 
interest expense for decreased to million with the million call premium on the notes included in interest expense offset by lower outstanding debt and lower interest rates 
average debt outstanding on the senior credit facility was million and million for and  respectively and the average interest rates were and  respectively 
depletion  depreciation and amortization increased to million due to higher production  an additional million of accretion expense related to the adoption of the new accounting principle for abandonment costs and higher amortization of unproved property costs 
the per mcfe dd a rate was  a increase from with higher accretion expense per mcfe and higher amortization of unproved property per mcfe 
the dd a rate is determined based on year end reserves based on nymex futures prices averaging per barrel and per mcf and the net book value associated with them and  to a lesser extent  depreciation on other assets owned 
the dd a rate in the fourth quarter of was per mcfe  reflecting year end reserves 
year end includes a tax expense of million versus a tax benefit of million in the prior year 
the prior year included a reversal of a valuation allowance as an million reduction of income tax expense 
year end provides tax expense at a rate of 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas on january  and recognized a million benefit from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of million of taxes 
comparison of to the operating and financial enhancement of the company continued in resulting in a transition year

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how the company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
all of the company s market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
all accounts of the company are us dollar denominated 
commodity price risk the company s major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices 
realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american gas production 
oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years 
the company periodically enters hedging arrangements with respect to its oil and gas production 
hedging is intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations 
the majority of hedges are swaps where the company receives a fixed price for its production and pays market prices to the counterparty 
in the second quarter of  the hedging program was modified to include collars which assume a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price 
realized gains and losses are generally recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs 
starting in  gains or losses on open contracts are recorded either in current period income or other comprehensive income oci 
the gains and losses realized as a result of hedging are substantially offset in the cash market when the commodity is delivered 
ineffective gains and losses are recognized in earnings in other revenue 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as of december  the company had oil and gas hedges in place covering billion cubic feet of gas  million barrels of oil and million barrels of ngls 
these contracts expire monthly through december of the fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of december  approximated a net pre tax loss of million 
gains or losses realized on hedging transactions are determined monthly based upon the difference between contract price received by the company for the sale of its hedged production and the hedge price  generally closing prices on the nymex 
these gains and losses are included as increases or decreases to oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold 
in  there was a net pre tax realized loss associated with the hedges of million followed by a gain of million in a pre tax loss realized of million was recorded relating to the company s hedges 
losses due to commodity hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings in other revenues 
the ineffective portion of hedges recorded was a gain of million in and losses of million in and million in in  a reduction in oil and gas prices  excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions  would have reduced revenue by million 
if oil and gas futures prices at december  had declined by  the unrealized hedging loss at that date would have decreased million 
interest rate risk at december   the company had million of debt outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
senior debt and non recourse debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  excluding interest rate swaps  which averaged at that date 
at december   great lakes had interest rate swap agreements totaling million  of which is consolidated by range 
these swaps consist of two agreements totaling million at which expire in may  two agreements totaling million at which expire in december  one agreement for million at which expires in june and two agreements totaling million at which expire in june on december   the day libor rate was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding net of amounts fixed through hedging transactions at december  would cost the company approximately million in additional annual interest  net of swaps
