overview the company is the leading distributor of aftermarket collision parts used in the repair of automobiles and light trucks in north america with locations throughout the united states and canada 
these product offerings  consisting of more than  stock keeping units  are manufactured by independent manufacturers and are sold primarily to collision repair shops 
approximately  of all of the collision repair work is paid for in part through insurance claims 
as a consequence  the company is dependent upon the acceptance of its products in the first instance by insurance companies and then by the collision repair shop performing the repairs 
before  substantially all collision replacements parts were manufactured by original equipment manufacturers oems 
since then  aftermarket parts  which generally sell for between and less than comparable oem parts  have provided a lower cost alternative to insurance companies seeking to contain the escalating cost of collision repairs 
however  aftermarket collision parts still only account for approximately of the collision parts market  which is still dominated by the oems 
because of the company s dependence on the acceptance of its products by insurance companies  its business is vulnerable to actions which impact the insurance industry 
during the past five years  the company s sales and profits have been adversely impacted by class action litigation against insurance companies for specifying aftermarket parts and a concerted effort  generally led by the oems  their dealer network and some collision repair shops  to have legislation passed at the state level restricting or eliminating the use of aftermarket parts in the repair of damaged vehicles 
see item business cautionary statements above 
other important risks which may impact the company s financial results  include the fact that i because the company s business is dependent on a continued source of supply of many automotive body parts which at present are only available from taiwan  it is vulnerable to any disruptions in shipping  increased shipping costs and the relationship of the us dollar to the new taiwan dollar  and ii the company is currently in the process of implementing new enterprise wide management information systems with all the complications and expense that such an implementation involves 
see item business cautionary statements above 
growth opportunities for the company include expanding its geographical coverage and increasing its penetration of existing markets through acquisitions  as well as greenfield openings  internal growth and expanding into new product markets  such as retail sales through retail parts distributors and offering the company s products on the web 
for example  the company recently completed two acquisitions in canada expanding its operations from vancouver  canada into the toronto  montreal and ottawa areas of canada 
challenges currently facing the company include managing its growth  integrating its acquisitions  controlling costs and completing the implementation of its enterprise wide software systems 
escalating costs of audits  sarbanes oxley compliance  health care and commercial insurance are also challenges for the company at this time 
the company s financial position remains strong as evidenced by a current ratio current assets to current liabilities of and by the generation of substantial cash flows from operations 
the company remains dependent on its bank line of credit to finance its current level of acquisition activity 
fiscal contained weeks as compared to weeks for the other fiscal years set forth in item above 
consequently  comparisons of certain results may not be meaningful 
fiscal will also be a week fiscal year 

table of contents critical accounting policies general 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  insurance  pensions and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if demand is less favorable than anticipated for certain parts  additional inventory write downs may be required 
bad debt 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company adjusts its allowance monthly based upon a formula relating to the aging of its receivables 
deferred taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
insurance 
the company s main insurance programs medical  workers compensation and vehicle are designed as large deductible programs 
through these programs the company self insures losses up to a deductible limit and purchases stop loss insurance to protect against losses that are over the deductible 
the stop loss insurance is purchased on an individual and aggregate basis 
the amount of the deductible has risen significantly in the last two years resulting in a shift of risk from the insurance carrier to the company 
the company estimates its cost for these programs and maintains reserves for incurred  but not reported  losses 
if the company were to experience an increase in claims activity over anticipated amounts  and its reserves are not sufficient  additional reserves may be required  which could have a material adverse impact on future earnings 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march   the company did not have any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements or obligations including contingent obligations that have  or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the company s financial condition  changes in the financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

these ratios include such items as amount of indebtedness  earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization  net worth and the current ratio 
in the event that the company s operations do not meet expectations it is possible that needed liquidity will not be available under the credit facility
