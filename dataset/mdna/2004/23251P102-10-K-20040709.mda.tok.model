business overview we are a neuromodulation company founded to design  develop and bring to market medical devices which provide a unique therapy  vns  for the treatment of epilepsy and other debilitating neurological  psychiatric diseases and other disorders 
vns therapy is currently approved for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in patients with partial onset seizures that are refractory or resistant to antiepileptic drugs 
product sales are primarily from sales in the epilepsy market 
on june   the panel of fda s medical devices advisory committee recommended approval with conditions of our vns therapy system as an adjunctive long term treatment of chronic or recurrent depression for patients over the age of who are experiencing a major depressive episode that has not had an adequate response to four or more adequate antidepressant treatments 
fda s division of general and restorative neurological devices will consider the deliberations  vote and recommendation of the panel and make the final decision on approval of the vns therapy system for the proposed indication for use 
based upon the panel s recommendation  we anticipate receiving final approval from fda by the end of calendar such final approval is at the sole discretion of fda and it is possible that such approval will not be received or that such approval contains conditions which we do not currently anticipate 
even if final fda approval is received  we do not anticipate significant sales from vns therapy in depression prior to calendar  if at all 
since  we have been conducting clinical studies of the vns therapy system for the treatment of depression in patients with major depressive episodes that have not responded to standard treatments 
the depression study program includes acute and long term clinical studies  acute and long term mechanism of action research and clinical and economic outcome studies in patients with treatment resistant depression receiving standard medical treatment that does not include vns 
we have also been conducting small pilot studies for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  anxiety and chronic migraine headache 
these studies are being conducted to determine the safety  effectiveness and cost effectiveness of vns therapy and are a principal component of our clinical research activities 
since inception  we have incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities that include product and process development and clinical trials and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities  manufacturing start up costs and systems infrastructure 
we have also made significant investments in recent periods in connection with the sales and marketing activities in the us and clinical research costs associated with new indications development  most notably depression 
for the period from inception through april   we incurred a cumulative net deficit of approximately million 
we 
table of contents anticipate significant investments in sales and marketing expenses associated with a planned product launch and start up in depression as well as continued investments in post approval and pre approval clinical studies in epilepsy  depression and other new indications 
excluding epilepsy studies  clinical studies are for investigational therapies subject to fda approval 
the primary exchange rate movements that impact our consolidated net sales growth include the us dollar as compared to the euro 
the weakening of the us dollar in fiscal generally has a favorable impact on our sales for the year 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting foreign currency impact on operating costs and expenses 
critical accounting policies we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies as the most critical because  in management s view  they are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results and most demanding in terms of requiring estimates and other exercises of judgment 
accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon specific customer risks and a general provision based upon historical trends 
an increase in losses beyond that expected by management or that historically have been experienced by us would reduce earnings when they become known 
inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost  first in  first out fifo method  or market 
cost includes the acquisition cost of raw materials and components  direct labor and overhead 
management considers potential obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
an acceleration of obsolescence could occur if consumer demand should differ from expectations 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
maintenance  repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred  significant renewals  improvements and expansions are capitalized 
for financial reporting purposes  we compute depreciation using the straight line method over useful lives ranging from two to nine years 
an unanticipated change in the utilization or expected useful life of property and equipment could result in acceleration in the timing of the expenses 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment to the customer  net of estimated returns and allowances 
our revenues are dependent upon sales to new and existing customers pursuant to our policy 
a change in this policy or sales terms could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized 
research and development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we have entered into contractual obligations for the conduct of clinical studies 
costs are incurred primarily at the time of enrollment and paid under the terms of the contracts 
research and development expenses could vary significantly with changes in the timing of clinical activity 
stock options 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standard board sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which disclosures are presented in 
table of contents note  summary of significant accounting policies and related data stock options 
because of this election  we continue to account for our employee stock based compensation plans under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and the related interpretations 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income for employee option grants for options granted under those plans having an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such differences relate primarily to the deductibility of certain accruals and reserves and the effect of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards not yet utilized 
deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on a more likely than not criteria in determining if a valuation allowance should be provided 
results of operations net sales us net sales increased by in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in average system price resulting from new product introductions and changes in product mix 
us average system price increased by over the prior year 
unit sales volumes in the us were essentially flat as new patient unit growth was offset by decreases in end of service sales as we approached the end of the m replacement cycle 
international net sales increased by in fiscal year due to increases in unit sales and average system price 
unit sales increased by approximately due to increasing demand in europe

us net sales increased by in fiscal year due to growth in unit sales and average system price 
us unit sales volumes increased by due to growth in new patient unit sales and increases in end of service replacement unit sales 
us average system price increased by largely due to the introduction of the m system 
international net sales increased by in fiscal year due to increases in unit sales of approximately and an increase of in average system price due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and changes in product mix 
gross profit in fiscal year  gross profit increased by and gross profit margin increased by basis points to 
in fiscal year  gross profit increased by and gross profit margin increased by basis points to 
the improvement in gross profit and gross profit margin for both years was the result of sales growth  increases in average selling price and improved manufacturing production efficiencies 
cost of sales consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  third party contractor costs  royalties  and the acquisition cost of raw materials and components 
we are obligated to pay royalties at rates between and of net sales in future periods 
gross margins can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based upon the mix between us and international sales  direct and distributor sales  the vns therapy system selling price  applicable royalty rates  and the levels of production volume 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses are comprised of sales  marketing  development  general and administrative activities

research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses are comprised of expenses related to our product and process development  product design efforts  clinical trials programs and regulatory activities 
r d expenses decreased by in fiscal year due to reduced spending in new indications development  primarily in the depression pivotal study costs which were lower in fiscal year  as clinical program costs 
table of contents progressed into the long term  lower cost phase of the d study 
r d expenses decreased by in fiscal year due to reduced spending in new indications development activities associated with the enrollment and acute phase of the depression pivotal study and other new indication pilot studies in fiscal year interest income interest income of  for fiscal year was comparable to fiscal year despite greater cash balances in fiscal year as a result of lower interest rates 
interest income of  declined considerably in fiscal year due to lower interest rates and lower cash balances on hand throughout the year 
interest expense interest expense was  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year increases in both years were due to the expanded use of a credit facility established in september and includes interest expense on capital leases for manufacturing equipment  which bears interest at over a term of five years 
the credit facility was increased from million to million in april and bears interest at the designated bank rate plus on the greater of million or the average of net balance owed by us at the close of each day during the month

cash proceeds during the period were primarily used to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
during fiscal year  cash on hand decreased by  to  net cash used in operating activities was approximately  compared to  in the prior year 
this increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to increases in working capital supporting our growth 
in fiscal  we received  in proceeds from the revolving line of credit and  in connection with the issuance of shares pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
cash proceeds during the period were primarily used to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
we are party to a number of contracts pursuant to which we are paying for clinical studies for current operating obligations payable totaling million as of april  although we have no firm commitments  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal year  primarily to expand manufacturing capabilities  and to enhance business infrastructure and facilities 
our current projections indicate that we have sufficient funds and cash flow resources to fund anticipated business activities through fiscal year without additional financing 
the chart below reflects our current obligations under our material contractual obligations 
capital total lease operating contractual line of credit obligations leases other obligations contractual obligations less than one year years years over years total contractual obligations capital leases are for manufacturing equipment used in the production of our vns therapy system 
operating leases are primarily obligations applicable to the lease of facilities and office equipment 
other represents commitments made for future events which are reflected on our balance sheet 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents  credit facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our current levels of operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
our liquidity could  however  be adversely affected by the factors affecting future operating results discussed below 
factors affecting future operating results in addition to the factors described above in this section and in the section of this annual report on form k entitled business  the following additional factors could affect our future results and  as a result  our common stock price 

table of contents our common stock price constantly changes 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market under the ticker symbol cybx 
the price of stock on that trading market fluctuates  and we expect that the market price of common stock will continue to fluctuate 
for instance  during the fiscal year ended april   our stock has traded from a high of to a low of per share 
the fluctuation in our stock price is caused by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our sales and operating results  regulatory activities and announcements  results of studies regarding the efficacy of our vns therapy treatment for other indications including depression  alzheimer s disease  anxiety and other disorders  announcements of significant contracts  acquisitions  or capital commitments  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of medical device companies  additions or departures of key personnel  sales or purchases of common stock by us  our officers and members of our board of directors  and changes in the general conditions of the economy 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies 
these broad market fluctuations have also adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our consolidated results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may be below the expectations of security analysts 
if so  the market price of our shares may decline 
our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter for several reasons  including the extent to which the vns therapy system gains market acceptance  the timing of obtaining marketing approvals for the vns therapy system for other indications  the timing of any approvals for reimbursement by third party payers  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as we expand our clinical  manufacturing  sales and marketing efforts  our ability to retain qualified sales personnel and the availability of key components  materials and contract services  which may depend on our ability to forecast sales 
we rely on only one product for our revenues and if sales of this product are not achieved  our operating results will be severely harmed 
we have only one product  the vns therapy system  which has been approved by fda for a single indication as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drugs 
we do not expect to have any other product or approved indication for the vns therapy in the us before october  if at all 
we cannot assure you that epilepsy sales will continue to increase  if at all 
we do not yet have the regulatory or reimbursement approvals necessary to commercialize the vns therapy system for the treatment of depression in the us we cannot assure you that any approval for the treatment of depression with the vns therapy system will be granted  nor can we assure you that even if us approval is granted  we will be successful in commercializing the vns therapy system for the treatment of depression 
the same uncertainty surrounds our efforts in anxiety disorders  alzheimer s disease applications and other indications 
our inability to successfully commercialize the vns therapy system for depression and other indications will severely harm our future growth 
we may not obtain fda approval to use our vns therapy system as an adjunctive therapy for depression 
the panel of fda s medical devices advisory committee recently voted to recommend approval of our vns therapy system as an adjunctive long term treatment of chronic or recurrent depression 
the approval was subject to certain conditions  and we cannot assure you that such conditions will be satisfied 
further  while the panel recommended approval  final approval requires formal action by fda and we may not ultimately receive fda s approval for the use of our product to treat depression 
even if we receive final 
table of contents approval  the approval may contain additional conditions which we have not anticipated 
if we do not receive such approval  or we receive approval with additional conditions  we may not be able to capture additional revenues for our device through the treatment of depression 
if we obtain fda s approval  we may experience difficulties and delays inherent in the development  manufacturing  marketing and sale of our vns therapy system for the treatment of depression 
if we receive approval to use our vns therapy system as adjunctive therapy for depression  we will be subject to extensive and rigorous ongoing regulation of the research  development  testing  manufacture  labeling  promotion  advertising  distribution and marketing of our product 
our failure to comply with these requirements or the identification of manufacturing or safety problems during commercial marketing could lead to the need for product marketing restrictions  product withdrawal or recall or other voluntary or regulatory action  which could delay further marketing until the product is brought into compliance 
our failure to comply with these requirements may also subject us to stringent penalties 
in addition to regulatory obstacles  we may need significant additional capital in the event fda s approval is received 
these capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors  including market acceptance of our product 
a large portion of our expenses is currently fixed  including expenses related to our facilities  equipment and personnel  and we expect to spend significant amounts to market our product for the treatment of depression 
as a result  we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase in the event of final fda s approval and  consequently  we will need to generate significant additional revenues to maintain profitability 
even if we do sustain profitability  we may not be able to increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
furthermore  if additional capital is required  we may not be able to access sufficient sources or to access capital on terms which are acceptable to us 
we may not be successful in our efforts to develop vns therapy for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  anxiety  or any other indications 
we are in the process of conducting studies to help us evaluate  and potentially obtain fda approval  for the use of vns therapy as a treatment for depression  alzheimer s disease  anxiety and other neurological disorders 
we cannot assure you that our test results will be positive or that we will receive fda approval for the use of our product for the treatment of any other indication 
even if we receive fda approval for another indication  we can provide no assurances with respect to market acceptance 
if our test results are not as we anticipate or if we receive no additional fda approvals or if alternative indications do not prove to be commercially viable  our revenues may not experience the growth that we would anticipate with the successful development of any of these indications 
we may not be able to expand or maintain market acceptance of the use of the vns therapy system to treat epilepsy  which could cause our sales to decrease 
continued market acceptance of the vns therapy system will depend on our ability to convince the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation and the vns therapy system 
while the vns therapy system has been implanted in approximately  patients through april   many physicians are still unfamiliar with this form of therapy 
we believe that existing antiepileptic drugs and surgery are the only other approved and currently available therapies competitive with the vns therapy system in the treatment of epileptic seizures 
these therapies may be more attractive to patients or their physicians than the vns therapy system in terms of efficacy  cost or reimbursement availability 
furthermore  we have not funded significant post market clinical research that will change physicians opinions or use of our product 
we cannot assure you that epilepsy sales will continue to increase  if at all 
we cannot assure you that the vns therapy system will achieve expanded market acceptance for the treatment of epilepsy or for any other indication 
failure of the vns therapy system to gain additional market acceptance would severely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in our marketing and sales efforts  which could severely harm our business 
in january  we determined that the investment of significant sales and marketing resources on physicians who had not previously prescribed vns therapy had not yielded an adequate return  and we reduced the size of our sales force and focused our sales and marketing investment solely on existing prescribers who have demonstrated their commitment to vns therapy 
while we believe these changes should ultimately improve productivity and performance going forward  we cannot assure you that those outcomes will be achieved 
the 
table of contents disruption caused by the reduction in sales force and the accompanying territory realignment for some field sales employees could delay improvements in productivity and efficiency longer than expected 
the time necessary for personnel to establish new territories and relationships of trust with new physicians may take longer than projected  which could substantially delay improvements in us sales performance or jeopardize attainment of quarterly revenue goals 
our inability to achieve annual or quarterly revenue targets could substantially harm our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
patient confidentiality and federal and state privacy laws and regulations may adversely impact our patient pull through selling model 
the hipaa privacy rule became effective in april in addition  virtually every state has enacted one or more laws to safeguard privacy  and these laws vary significantly from state to state and change frequently 
the hipaa privacy rule preempts a state privacy law only if the state privacy law is narrower in scope than the hipaa privacy rule 
consequently  the applicable privacy rules can vary state by state  and the determination of the privacy rules applicable in any one state can be very difficult 
the operation of our business involves the collection and use of substantial amounts of protected health information  including patient information provided by physicians to assist in the treatment of patients  information provided by patients themselves to assist them in scheduling surgery and confirming their eligibility for third party reimbursement  patient information provided by hospitals in connection with their efforts to obtain third party reimbursement  patient information collected by our regulatory affairs department in the investigation of product complaints and the tracking of implanted devices  and patient information collected by our clinical affairs department as part of a patient registry 
we endeavor to conduct our business as a covered entity under the hipaa privacy rule and consistent with the texas privacy laws  obtaining hipaa compliant patient authorizations where required to support the collection and use of patient information  including in connection with our patient identification and qualification piq pull through selling model 
we also sometimes act as a business associate for a covered entity 
for example  we sometimes provide assistance to hospitals covered entities in connection with their claims for third party reimbursement of vns therapy systems and procedures 
even if our business model is compliant with the hipaa privacy rule and the texas privacy laws  it may not be compliant with the privacy laws of all states 
in addition  despite extensive efforts to conduct our business as a covered entity under the hipaa privacy rule and the texas privacy laws  the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services or another government enforcement agency may determine that we are obligated to comply with the hipaa privacy rule or another law and that our business model or operations are not in compliance  which could subject us to penalties and could severely limit our ability to market and sell vns therapy under our existing business model and could harm our business growth and financial condition 
we may be unable to maintain adequate third party reimbursement on our product 
our ability to commercialize the vns therapy system successfully depends in part on whether third party payers  including private healthcare insurers  managed care plans  the us government s medicare and medicaid programs and others  agree both to cover the vns therapy system and associated procedures and services and to reimburse at adequate levels for the costs of the vns therapy system and the related services we have in the us or internationally 
if we fail to maintain favorable coverage decisions for the vns therapy system in a timely manner  patients and their physicians could be deterred from using the vns therapy system  which could reduce our sales and severely harm our business 
our current and future expense estimates are based  in large part  on estimates of future sales  which are difficult to predict 
we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected sales shortfall 
if increased expenses are not accompanied by increased sales  our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for any particular quarter could be harmed 
if our suppliers and manufacturers are unable to meet our demand for materials  components and contract services  we may be forced to qualify new vendors or change our product design which would impair our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
we rely upon sole source suppliers for certain of the key components  materials and contract services used in manufacturing the vns therapy system 
we periodically experience discontinuation or unavailability of components  materials and contract services which may require us to qualify alternative sources or  if no such alternative sources are identified  change our product design 
we believe that pursuing and qualifying alternative sources and or redesigning 
table of contents specific components of the vns therapy system  if or when necessary  could consume significant resources 
in addition  such changes generally require regulatory submissions and approvals 
any extended delays in or an inability to secure alternative sources for these or other components  materials and contract services could result in product supply and manufacturing interruptions  which could significantly harm our business 
our products may be found to have defects that result in product recalls 
the vns therapy system includes a complex electronic generator device and lead device designed to be implanted in the human body 
component failures  manufacturing or shipping problems or design defects could result in the product not delivering the therapy for which it is indicated 
the occurrence of such problems or other adverse clinical reactions could result in a recall of our products  possibly requiring explantation and potential reimplantation of the vns therapy system which may increase risk to the patient 
any product recall could severely harm our business  and our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use  which could diminish the value of our products and impair our ability to compete 
our success depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for the vns therapy system and its improvements  and for vagus nerve stimulation therapy 
to that end  we have acquired licenses under certain patents and have patented and intend to continue to seek patents on our own inventions used in our products and treatment methods 
the process of seeking patent protection can be expensive and time consuming  and we cannot assure you that patents will be issued from our currently pending or future applications or that  if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology or any commercial advantage to us 
further  the protection offered by the licensed international patents is not as strong as that offered by the licensed us patents due to differences in patent laws 
in particular  the european patent convention prohibits patents covering methods for treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy 
we may engage in litigation to protect our proprietary rights  or defend against infringement claims by third parties  causing us to suffer significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us  may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing  selling or using the vns therapy system  any of which could severely harm our business 
intense competition and rapid technological changes could reduce our ability to market our products and achieve sales 
we believe that existing and future antiepileptic drugs will continue to be the primary competition for the vns therapy system 
we may also face competition from other medical device companies that have the technology  experience and capital resources to develop alternative devices for the treatment of epilepsy 
medtronic  inc  for example  continues to clinically assess an implantable signal generator used with an invasive deep brain probe  or thalamic stimulator  for the treatment of neurological disorders and has received fda approval for the device for the treatment of essential tremor  including that associated with parkinson s disease 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do and have obtained third party reimbursement approvals for their therapies 
in addition  the healthcare industry is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
our competitors may develop technologies and obtain regulatory approval for products that are more effective in treating epilepsy than our current or future products 
in addition  advancements in surgical techniques may make surgery a more attractive therapy for epilepsy 
the development by others of new treatment methods with novel antiepileptic drugs  medical devices or surgical techniques for epilepsy could render the vns therapy system non competitive or obsolete 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  including new products and technology  which could severely harm our business and our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to claims of product liability and we may not have the resources or insurance to cover the cost for losses under these claims 
as an implantable medical device  the manufacture and sale of the vns therapy system entails the risk of product liability claims  which we have received from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
we may be responsible for large deductibles for each claim  and our product liability coverage may not be adequate to cover judgments that may result from these claims 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may only be available at significantly higher premiums or not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could significantly harm our business and financial condition 
if we do not continue to comply with changing government laws and regulations  we could lose our ability to market and sell our product or be subject to substantial fines or other penalties 
the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of the vns therapy system are subject to extensive and rigorous federal and state laws and regulations  including regulations from the department of health and human services related to medicare  hipaa and fda and from comparable state agencies 
in the future  it will be necessary for us to obtain additional government approvals for other applications of the vns therapy system and for modified or future generation products 
it will also be necessary for us to ensure that our marketing and sales practices comply with all laws and regulations 
commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is also subject to obtaining regulatory approvals from the appropriate authorities in such countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
moreover  regulatory approvals may include regulatory restrictions on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  fines  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  confiscations or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals 
we may not be able to obtain additional future regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such future approvals  suspension or withdrawal of previously received approvals or recalls of the vns therapy system could severely harm our ability to market and sell our current and future products and improvements 
our international operations are subject to risks not generally associated with commercialization efforts in the us we may not be successful in increasing our international market sales or in obtaining reimbursement or any regulatory approvals required in foreign countries 
the anticipated international nature of our business is also expected to subject us and our representatives  agents and distributors to laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or where the vns therapy system is sold 
the regulation of medical devices in a number of such jurisdictions  particularly in the european union  continues to develop and new laws or regulations may impair our ability to market and sell our products in those jurisdictions 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our ability to maintain our costs or capture new business could suffer 
in connection with the commercialization of the vns therapy system in the us  we have begun and intend to continue to expand significantly the scope of our operations  in particular in manufacturing and in marketing and sales 
such activities have placed  and may continue to place a significant strain on our resources and operations 
our ability to manage such growth effectively will depend upon our ability to attract  hire and retain highly qualified employees and management personnel 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
our success will also depend upon the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  management information and financial control systems 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business will suffer 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to limited market risk on interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments in commercial paper and our line of credit 
we do not hedge interest rate exposure or invest in derivative 
table of contents securities 
based upon the average outstanding balances in cash  cash equivalents and our line of credit  a basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial results 
due to the global reach of our business  we are also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly with the us dollar over the euro 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiary is consolidated into our financial results and is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially impacted by changes in these or other factors 
at this time  we have not deemed it to be cost effective to engage in a program of hedging the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our operating results using derivative financial instruments 
a sensitivity analysis indicates that  if the us dollar uniformly weakened against the euro  the effect upon net income would be favorable by approximately  or 
conversely  if the us dollar uniformly strengthened against the euro  the impact on net income would decrease by approximately  or
