item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
results of operations for purposes of financial reporting  the company operates in two industry segments the fuller brands segment  which is involved in developing  manufacturing  distributing  and marketing branded consumer and commercial cleaning and personal care products in north america and internationally  and the cpac imaging imaging segment  which includes the company s color photographic  health care  and graphic arts imaging operations in the united states  belgium  italy  south africa  and thailand 
the products of each segment are manufactured and marketed both in the us and in other parts of the world 
sales between segments are not material 
the company s financial results for the fiscal year ended march  include an after tax charge of per diluted share for the imaging restructuring initiative see note to the consolidated financial statements  an after tax charge of per diluted share for its equity in losses from tura  now required to be recognized due to the change in accounting  as a result of cpac s increased ownership  and an after tax charge of per diluted share related to the recognition of an impairment loss on the company s investment in tura see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding tura charges 
the company s financial results for the fiscal year ended march  reflect the adoption of sfas no 
during the company s first quarter of fiscal adoption included the recording of a one time  non cash expense of  net of a tax benefit of  or per diluted share 
the adjustment related to the fuller brands segment s cleaning technologies group ctg investment in fiscal  whose goodwill was determined to be impaired  based on calculating the present value of future discounted cash flows 
ctg had been impacted by several factors  including continued  reduced operating performance  since it was acquired see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net sales the company s net sales decreased in  as compared to  and in  as compared to decreased and  respectively  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange 
for the fuller brands segment  net sales for decreased  as compared to the fuller brush division fuller experienced a net sales decline for  as compared to the decline was largely attributable to a decrease in certain private label business  lessened by an increase in the qvc home shopping network business 
stanley home products stanley net sales declined in  as compared to with its hiring of a new president  stanley has defined a new strategic direction  which will emphasize new product development and work to improve recruitment of independent sales representatives and increase average order size 
these improvements  initiated in the third quarter  have yet to stem year over year net sales declines  but the company believes the rate of declines should begin to slow 
cleaning technologies group ctg net sales also declined  with net sales for declining  as compared to ctg s business in fiscal has been impacted by lower distributor sales to school districts  due to state and local budget constraints 
this has caused the division to diversify its customer mix by attempting to increase sales to national accounts  retail chains  and gsa scheduled business for government procurement 
the company is hopeful this will mitigate and reverse sales declines in future periods 
in for the fuller brands segment  net sales decreased approximately  or over stanley s net sales for the year ended march  decreased approximately 
the significant decrease was a result of difficulties in recruiting and retaining independent sales representatives  which are necessary to sustain and to grow this consumer direct selling business 
net sales for the fuller brush company increased approximately due to the additional sales garnered through the division s entrance into the qvc home shopping network business  while ctg s net sales declined approximately due primarily to a reduction in business with kmart 
in the imaging segment  net sales decreased for  as compared to decreased  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange 
most imaging operations  domestically and internationally  with the exception of cpac asia and cpac africa  had lower net sales in  as compared to  on a local currency basis 
this reflects the worldwide slowdown in the traditional imaging marketplace  due partly to the advances of digital products  fierce competition from larger entities  and currency pressures overseas  due to the stronger euro and japanese yen versus the us dollar 
domestically  the company s medical imaging and photo imaging had decreases in  as compared to  ranging from to 
the advances of digital technology are expected to continue to impact both of these operations in future quarters 
reduction in revenue was anticipated  spurring the imaging restructuring plan  which enables the company to manufacture all domestic imaging products at one location see foreign operations discussion for international operation s annual results 
further actions may be necessary  if cost saving initiatives cannot compensate for declining revenues 
in for the imaging segment  net sales decreased over decreased  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange 
the decrease was partially caused by a decrease in net sales in the company s domestic medical imaging business 
this part of the imaging business continues to be affected by the presence of digital imaging  as well as continued competition within its distribution network 
while the company s domestic photochemical imaging business net sales were down less than  this business continues to be impacted by the slowdown in picture taking in the us  as well as price competition 
growth in its foreign imaging businesses aided by favorable foreign currency exchange improved the segment s net sales performance see foreign operations section 
gross margins consolidated gross margins  exclusive of the imaging restructuring charges  were for versus and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
gross margins in the fuller brands segment were   and for the years ended march    and  respectively 
declines in gross margins resulted from lower production volume through the great bend  kansas  manufacturing facility  because of lower sales in each segment operation 
the company believes that increasing sales  as a result of its retail initiative  may aid in increasing production throughput and improving product margins in future periods 
the improvement in gross margins in versus reflected the impact of the television home shopping business  which has higher gross margins accompanied by higher selling and marketing costs  coupled with less volume of ctg s competitively priced national accounts business 
gross margins in the imaging segment  exclusive of the restructuring charges  were   and for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the decline in gross margins in versus reflect the continued pressures on pricing  due to the declining worldwide photographic and medical imaging markets  coupled with lower volumes of production 
a similar situation existed in versus  with lower domestic volumes of production of photographic and medical imaging chemicals  in conjunction with lower pricing of products in overseas markets 
selling  administrative and engineering expenses consolidated selling  administrative  and engineering costs in  exclusive of the imaging restructuring charges  were of net sales  versus and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
for the fuller brands segment  selling  administrative  and engineering expenses for were of net sales  as compared to and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage in versus previous years reflects additional expense related to increased sales and marketing management  packaging revisions  and other initiatives related to fuller s expansion into the retail marketplace 
the increase also reflects the reduction in revenues in all divisions 
during the fourth quarter  the segment undertook a comprehensive review of its fixed costs  which resulted in small reductions in personnel and other discretionary spending  and will continue to search for future cost reduction opportunities 
the increase in versus was partially a result of the increased sales through the home shopping distribution channel  which has higher sales and marketing costs 
in the imaging segment  selling  administrative  and engineering costs for  exclusive of the imaging restructuring charges  were of net sales  as compared to and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in versus is largely a result of revenues declining at a greater rate than expenses  especially in the segment s domestic operations 
while the imaging restructuring plan is expected to eliminate duplicate costs in the domestic imaging operations  the segment continues to reduce fixed costs in light of falling revenues and has reduced headcount and other discretionary spending during the fourth quarter 
the company will also be seeking fixed cost reductions in its european operations  which appear to have been impacted by increasing digital imaging competition  as well as adverse currency pressures 
the increase in over was partially a result of increasing foreign accounts receivable reserves  as well as flat expenses on decreasing revenues  in the segment s domestic medical imaging operation 
research and development expenses research and development expenses  as a percentage of sales have remained relatively consistent at approximately of net sales for  versus and of net sales for and  respectively 
the level of expense reflects the company s emphasis of focusing on improving existing products or developing complimentary products  based on customer needs 
for the fuller brands segment s focus will continue developing new products to enhance its entry into the retail marketplace and growing television shopping business  stimulate recruitment efforts in its direct selling business  as well as continuing to enhance ctg s commercial cleaning product offerings to compete in the highly competitive janitorial sanitation business 
in the imaging segment  continued effort will be placed on developing easy to use prepackaged  chemical formulations and innovative wrap around programs  involving chemistry  paper  and equipment for use in domestic and overseas imaging markets 
these efforts are not expected to increase research and development expenses  as a percentage of sales  significantly from prior periods 
net interest expense net interest expense interest expense less interest income increased in versus while interest expense declined  due to lower debt levels  interest income declined even greater  due to lower levels of invested cash 
net interest expense declined in versus  largely because of net debt reduction at the company s foreign operations and continued lower debt interest rates both domestically and overseas 
while cash and equivalents increased in versus  lower interest rates on invested cash caused interest income to decline 
income taxes in the company recorded a net tax benefit of  or of the pretax loss 
the benefit was primarily attributable to domestic losses that were carried back to offset previous year s earnings resulting in various state and us refundable taxes 
the net benefit was reduced somewhat by foreign tax expense  resulting from earnings at cpac europe  italia  and africa 
the company s asian subsidiary continued to enjoy the tax savings from its seven year tax holiday granted in thailand  which amounted to approximately  per diluted share 
the tax holiday expires in fiscal the effective tax rate for income before taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was in  as compared to in the continued reduction in the company s effective tax rate in resulted from a lower provision from its italian operation  who received certain tax credits and benefits related to its facility relocation  as well as the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards at its african operation 
similar to  the effective rate shows the benefits of the seven year tax holiday existing for the company s asian subsidiary  as well as lower state taxes due to reduced domestic earnings 
since the company continues to receive the tax holiday into fiscal  cpac asia will continue to significantly impact the future effective rate  depending on its profitability 
in conjunction with the sfas no 
goodwill adjustment recognized by the company in the first quarter of amounting to  a tax benefit of  was r ecorded 
this deferred asset is expected to be realized over the next nine years  as the goodwill is deducted for income tax purposes 
at march  the company has recorded gross deferred tax assets of approximately  with no valuation reserve 
these deferred tax assets consist primarily of domestic us federal and state tax benefits for items which have been recognized for financial reporting purposes  but which will be reported on tax returns to be filed in the future and approximately  representing tax effected foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
realization of the domestic portion of the net deferred tax asset is dependent upon profitable operations in the united states during future years 
despite domestic pretax losses for the year ended march   the company believes they are primarily attributable to the asset impairment and equity in losses from its investment in tura and the imaging restructuring plan and that the company will return to profitability in fiscal likewise  realization of the deferred tax asset related to the foreign net operating loss carryforward is also dependent on future  foreign income 
although realization for both is not assured  the company believes  in following the criteria specified in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
should the company experience a significant  future  unanticipated impairment or restructuring charge  it is possible that it could be required to record a valuation allowance on a portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
net income loss the company s income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended march   decreased  as compared to the year ended march  the imaging restructuring expenses  the increasing losses of tura required to be recognized under the equity method of accounting  the impairment charge related to the company s investment in tura  and the reduced revenues in both segments contributed to the decline 
the company s income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended march   decreased  or as compared to the proforma net income for of  the proforma net income for represents net income as if the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
had been applied in the prior year 
sales declines  the continuation of investments in sales and marketing programs  and the rebuilding of management teams in both segments contributed to this decline 
the company adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of and recorded a one time  non cash expense of  net of a tax benefit of  or per diluted share 
the adjustment related to the fuller brands segment s cleaning technologies group ctg investment in fiscal  whose goodwill was determined to be impaired  based on calculating the present value of future cash flows 
ctg had been impacted by several factors  including continued  reduced operating performance see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the net loss after the cumulative effect adjustment was  or a diluted share 
foreign operations the results of operations for the company s foreign subsidiaries  including the impacts of currency exchange  are reported on a three month lag 
inter company sales between foreign operations have been eliminated in discussions of year over year fluctuations on a us dollar basis  as well as disclosures concerning amounts and percentages  with foreign currency impacts excluded 
combined net sales for the company s operations in thailand  south africa  belgium  and italy for fiscal  as compared to  increased approximately  or or increased approximately  or  excluding the impact of currency exchange 
for fiscal cpac europe and italia net sales combined increased decreased  after removing currency impact 
cpac asia s sales increased increased  after removing currency impact 
cpac africa continued to demonstrate growth  as net sales increased approximately  or  or  after removing currency impact 
combined net sales of the company s foreign operations in belgium  italy  south africa  and thailand for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  increased approximately  or increased approximately  or  excluding the impact of currency exchange 
net sales increases at cpac asia of approximately  or approximately  or  excluding foreign currency impact and net sales increases at a combined cpac europe and italia of approximately  or approximately  or  excluding foreign currency impact contributed to the year over year increase 
continued strong sales in the asian marketplace and increased photochemical paper sales offsetting sluggish chemical sales contributed to the combined european operation increase 
in addition  cpac africa s net sales increased approximately  or due to the rand declining against the us dollar  actual increase would have been greater on a co nstant dollar basis 
combined pretax profits for fiscal  prior to minority interests and equity in losses of tura  increased approximately  approximately  excluding impact of currency exchange  as compared to fiscal cpac europe and italia s pretax profits combined increased approximately approximately  excluding impact of currency exchange 
cpac africa s fiscal pretax income declined approximately  approximately  after removing currency impact  while cpac asia s profits were up approximately  approximately  after removing currency impact over fiscal over  of this increase resulted from the fiscal cpac asia bad debt provision increase  due to a troubled distributor account 
combined pretax profits for the company s foreign operations in fiscal  prior to minority interests and equity in losses of tura  declined approximately  or over expenses related to accounts receivable collection problems with distributor receivables at both cpac asia and cpac europe increased the allowance for doubtful accounts in of approximately  net of minority interest 
cpac asia s difficulties  disclosed in the second and third quarterly q filings  resulted from a japanese distributor  whereas cpac europe s difficulties increased its allowance for doubtful accounts in the fourth quarter of approximately  primarily due to problems in russia 
cpac italia s start up expenses in the first quarter  amounting to approximately  relating to its move to a new manufacturing facility also impacted the year to date results 
however  cpac africa s results for partially offset the decline  as it experienced an approximate  inc rease in pretax profit  net of minority interest  its best performance since being acquired in as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company increased the investment in tura to requiring the change in accounting for this investment to the equity method 
commencing in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded its share of tura s net loss  plus the amortization of the purchase price in fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded its of tura s net loss  plus the amortization of the purchase price 
tura s results reflect the worldwide economic pressures on the traditional film markets  as well as the stronger euro against the dollar 
the worldwide  economic slowdown in early  along with the german economic and banking crisis  put substantial pressure on operating results and cash flows at tura 
this situation significantly worsened in late  when the currency conversion rates shifted so that product produced in germany and valued in euro  was no longer competitive for export to countries that relied on the us dollar for pricing and payments 
in turn  this situation resulted in significant cash flow problems and operating losses that continued through april of  and the strength of the euro is expected to continue over the next few operating periods 
in may  the company met with the primary lending institution for tura to discuss the financial condition and cash flow problems 
while tura was granted an extension until september  on the maturity date of its working capital line of credit  the ability for tura to meet its normal day to day operating expenses appears conditional on obta ining future capital infusions 
although the company has the option of increasing its ownership stake to by october  it is unwilling to commit to further investment at this time 
it will continue to monitor tura s financial condition to determine if operating and economic improvements appear forthcoming 
after recognition of approximately  and  of equity losses  including  and  of excess purchase price amortization for the years ended march  and  respectively  the company believes that the ability of tura to generate sufficient future cash flows is uncertain 
tura s financial statements show current liabilities exceeding current assets  certain debt obligations having covenant violations  and operating losses continuing through tura s first quarter 
the company believes tura s current financial decline is other than temporary and has recognized an impairment loss of approximately  or 
cents per diluted share for the year ended march   reducing the estimated fair market value of the company s investment at march  to  the impairment adjustment reduces the previously allocated excess purchase price  leaving a value that the company believes is largely attributable to the supply contracts be tween the company and tura 
the company has exposure to currency fluctuations and occasionally has utilized hedging programs primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts to help minimize the impact of these fluctuations on results of operations 
at march  no forward foreign currency exchange contracts were outstanding 
the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
on a consolidated basis  foreign currency exchange losses are included in income or expense as incurred and are not material to the results of operations 
imaging restructuring during fiscal  the company completed the shift of its domestic manufacturing of photochemicals from its st 
louis  missouri  facility to its cpac imaging manufacturing facility in norcross  georgia 
the transfer of the manufacturing fixed assets  as well as the retrofitting of the georgia facility to absorb this production  was largely completed during december related to this endeavor  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and has accounted for the employee termination costs and other costs associated with the move under its guidelines 
most employees were offered severance packages  which were payable upon rendering service  until termination dates 
as of march   all of the termination benefit costs have been accrued 
the majority of the other associated costs of moving and integrating the two operations had been incurred through the company s fiscal third quarter  with some residual costs occurring in fiscal s fourth quarter 
the total expenses incurred in this project were approximately  the table below summarizes the total costs accrued and paid under the criteria described in sfas no 
for the year ended march  severance pay and benefits reserve unaudited other associated costs reserve total first quarter fiscal charges first quarter fiscal paid june  balance second quarter fiscal charges second quarter fiscal paid september  balance third quarter fiscal charges third quarter fiscal paid december  balance fourth quarter fiscal charges fourth quarter fiscal paid march  balance during the third quarter  the company began actively marketing the st 
louis facility for sale 
as such  the company is accounting for the potential sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and has reclassified approximately  from property  plant  and equipment  net to assets held for sale 
depreciation on the reclassified building was suspended beginning in the third quarter of fiscal the impact was not material 
no impairment charge was recorded at march   as the fair market value of the property  less costs to dispose  exceeded the recorded cost 
the company expects to sell the property in the next three to six months 
the company continues to lease a  square foot warehouse space adjacent to the st 
louis manufacturing facility with approximately three years remaining original lease was for ten years  with a five year termination clause 
the com pany has not concluded at this time as to whether it will utilize this space for distribution purposes or attempt to sublease it  and as such  has not accrued any lease impairment or termination costs at march  liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and acquisitions with internally generated cash flows  supplemented with outside borrowings 
the following table summarizes cpac  inc s consolidated cash flow information in thousands for the years ended march  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities currency impact on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by used in operating activities consolidated net cash provided by operating activities decreased in as compared to due to reduced operating profits in both segments 
consolidated net cash provided by operating activities decreased in as compared to primarily due to lower income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  caused by lower imaging segment profits 
net cash provided by used in investing activities consolidated net cash used in investing activities increased in versus  due to the company s additional  equity investment in tura in april  as well as capital expenditures related to cpac imaging s expansion of their norcross manufacturing facility to absorb the relocated color photochemicals production from st 
louis 
consolidated net cash used in investing activities decreased in versus  due to the company s equity investment in tura ag in property  plant and equipment additions in were relatively consistent with levels  with the largest expenditure related to cpac italia s move and improvements to their new manufacturing facility in gorgonzola 
net cash provided by used in financing activities consolidated net cash used in financing activities decreased in over  due to decreased repurchases of the company s common stock  offset by increased debt repayments 
in fiscal  cpac asia s strong cash flows allowed it to repay its outstanding term debt early 
consolidated net cash used in financing activities decreased in over one of the contributors to the decrease was the reduction in common stock shares repurchased during the year  and reduced debt paydowns because of lower debt levels in working capital ratios working capital is the excess of current assets over current liabilities 
the working capital ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities 
for the years ended march  working capital in thousands working capital ratio to to to during the company s working capital declined  as described above  due to increased investment in tura  increased capital expenditures related to the imaging restructuring project  and reduction in cpac asia s long term  term note obligations 
in the company continued to build working capital  despite lower sales and profits  due to tight cash controls  aggressive receivable collections  implementation of inventory reduction goals within the fuller brands segment  and reduction in working capital borrowings at cpac asia  as a result of continued strong cash flow 
during despite the shortfall in sales and profits  the company s fuller brands segment continued to provide positive cash flow  allowing the consolidated company to continue its stock repurchase programs  acquire capital assets where needed  and fund the imaging segment s investment in tura ag 
the company maintains a line of credit agreement agreement with bank of america boa  maturing on october  the agreement includes a maximum borrowing capability of   at march   with interest at the day libor rate plus to  based on funded debt to ebitda parameters 
it also requires the company to meet various debt covenants  including minimum net worth  debt service coverage  funded debt to ebitda  as well as limitations on capital expenditures  and amounts spent on acquisitions 
during the years ended march  and  the company did not borrow against the line of credit 
at march  the company was in violation of the minimum net worth  debt service coverage  and funded debt to ebitda covenants  largely in part to the impairment adjustment and restructuring expenses incurred in the company has received waivers from bank of america on the covenant violations at march   and as part of the waiver  has agreed to reduce its maximum borrowing capacity under the facility to  the company is in the process of negotiating a new two year line of credit agreement with bank of america and anticipates compliance with future quarterly and annual covenants 
the company has also renewed its million letter of credit facility  which collateralizes the fuller brands industrial revenue bonds  on june   and as such  has continued to classify the bonds as long term at march  the company s majority owned subsidiary cpac asia imaging products limited has a line of credit with an international bank of million baht approximately  based on the year end conversion rate in thailand 
interest is payable at the bank s announced prime rate in thailand  which was at march  cpac asia imaging products limited had borrowings against the line of credit of  at march  management believes that its existing available lines of credit and cash flows from operations should be adequate to meet normal working capital needs  based on operations as of march  additional financing may be necessary to allow the company to pursue further acquisitions 
asset turnover ratios for the years ended march  receivables days outstanding days days days annual inventory turns times times times receivable days outstanding improved slightly in versus by continued success of the fuller brands segment in improving cash collections 
in addition  despite sale shortfalls  the imaging segment continues to maintain consistent days sales in receivables  despite the worldwide imaging market slowdown 
more dramatic improvement in versus reflected the start of the fuller brands segment s goal of reducing days sales outstanding 
inventory turns continued its slight decrease in versus  due to lower sales than anticipated 
both segments of the company s business will attempt to reduce inventories in the coming year to better match anticipated sales levels and improve overall cash maintenance 
the slight decrease in versus was  again  due to the difficulty in matching inventory levels  especially in the imaging segment  with anticipated sales levels 
profitability ratios operating return on net sales is the result of dividing operating income loss defined as income before non operating income expense  income taxes  and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  plus net interest expense by net sales 
net income loss on net sales is calculated by dividing net income loss by net sales 
net income loss to net worth is calculated by dividing net income loss by the amount of ending shareholders equity 
for the years ended march  operating return on net sales net income loss to net sales net income loss to net worth the decrease in operating return on net sales in as compared to is largely a result of the combined million dollar expense incurred by the company from its equity pickup of tura s losses  the resulting impairment charge recognized related to the company s recorded investment in tura  and the million dollar expense incurred for the imaging restructuring initiative  coupled with continued declines in both segments revenues 
net income loss to net sales and net income loss to net worth and both had negative returns  due to special non recurring charges described previously 
the decrease in operating return on net sales in as compared to is largely a function of the imaging segment s reduced sales with flat operating costs  higher unallocated corporate overhead  mitigated by an improvement in the fuller brands segment s operating income led by its entry into the television home shopping business 
the negative return on net income loss on net sales and net income loss to net worth for is a function of the million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle charge taken upon adoption of sfas no 
in the company s first quarter 
leverage ratios debt to debt plus equity is calculated by dividing all liabilities by the sum of all liabilities plus shareholders equity 
total debt to equity is calculated by dividing all liabilities by the amount of shareholders equity 
these ratios measure the extent to which the company has been financed by debt and are an important measure to our lending institutions 
for the years ended march  debt to debt plus equity total debt to equity to to to in debt to debt plus equity and debt to equity increased versus  due to a slight increase in liabilities over previous year end amounts 
in debt to debt plus equity and debt to equity remained relatively constant versus  despite the net loss incurred by the company  as a result of the sfas no 
adoption and related adjustment of million  net of tax 
also helping to minimize the decline was the fact that total liabilities decreased  while equity decreases slowed due to the reduction of the company s stock buyback program 
contractual cash obligations amounts in thousands the following table summarizes information about the company s consolidated contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in thousands  as of march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its consolidated liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years long term debt operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year to years to years after years unused credit facilities standby letters of credit total commercial commitments as of march   the company had no borrowings against its million line of credit with its primary domestic lending institution 
as of march   the company s majority owned subsidiary cpac asia imaging products limited had borrowed approximately  against its  line of credit  leaving  of available borrowing capacity 
the company believes that these liabilities have no material impact on cpac  inc s liquidity and capital resources 
as of the date of the report  cpac  inc had no other commercial commitments  which may impact its capital resources and liquidity 
in the absence of unforeseen developments  cpac  inc believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operating expenses and other operational requirements at least for the months following the date of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
cpac  inc believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve additional management judgement due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue  and expense amounts 
revenue recognition the company s revenues result primarily from sales of chemical based products or complementary hard goods in each of its segments 
for revenue recognition purposes  the company reviews all sales transactions to ensure the following attributes are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of ownership transfer  sales price fixed and determinable  and collectibility reasonably assured 
in the fuller brands segment  the product offerings consist of sales of cleaning and personal care chemical based products both consumer and industrial as well as related stick good products ie  brushes  brooms  mops 
although sales are generated through various distribution channels  such as independent distributors  company employed sales associates  direct selling independent representatives  retail outlet stores  catalog  internet  direct marketing partners  and direct to end users  the revenue recognition policies remain virtually the same in each operation or channel 
shipping of these products is primarily by land using independent freight carriers 
at the time revenue is recognized  the company provides for the estimated costs of product returns and reduces revenue for estimated returns 
in the consolidated statement of operations  the company presents sales at net  adjusting for sales discounts  returns and allowances  and volume rebates  whic h are not deemed significant 
in the imaging segment  revenue results primarily from sales of chemicals used in the photofinishing  medical imaging or graphic arts arenas 
imaging s distribution channels  both domestic and international  are primarily through independent distributors  or direct to end users  with limited company employed sales associates 
revenue recognition practices are similar in all venues 
domestically  most products are shipped via land carriers 
in situations where legal contracts have stipulated the time at which title transfer has occurred fob destination versus traditional fob shipping  revenue is recognized according to contract terms 
internationally  chemical products are shipped via truck and sea 
again  special emphasis is placed on reviewing contractual terms to ensure the point at which title and risk of ownership has transferred and that the other revenue recognition attributes criteria are present 
appropriate accruals for discounts and volume rebates  which exist for sales into the medical imaging market  are recorded at time of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company regularly reviews its customer accounts and records specific provisions for doubtful accounts to reduce the related receivable to the amount that is estimated to be collectible 
the company also records provisions for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the company s historical experience  current economic conditions  and other adverse industry or market trends 
if circumstances related to specific customers were to change  the company s estimates with respect to the collectibility of the related receivables could be further adjusted 
the company considers all available information in its quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
the company recorded an expense provision of   and  to the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended march    and  respectively 
as previously discussed the increase in s expense provision was primarily due to cpac asia and cpac europe s troubled distributor receivables in japan and russia 
inventory reserves the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
as part of this valuation  reserve provisions are made to reduce inventory carrying values based on estimates of what is excess  slow moving  or obsolete  or for inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these provisions are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions  and related management initiatives 
if in the future  the company determines that market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected and  therefore  inventory is overvalued  the company will be required to further reduce the carrying value of the inventory and record an expense at the time the determination is made 
the company recorded an expense provision of   and  for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory to the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the increase in over previous year s expense reflected additional reserve provisions in the fuller brands segment for products experiencing net realizability issues  as well as the phase out of certain product lines sold in the segments direct selling business 
in addition  the company s imaging operations increased their reserves related to aging chemical and packaging inventory no longer salable 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the carrying value of its identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable  or in the case of goodwill  at least annually 
certain factors  which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists  include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to actual historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in the event that the carrying value of assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
events or changes in circumstances could occur that may create underperformance relative to projected future cash fl ows  which could create future impairments 
the company s policy is consistent with current accounting guidance as prescribed by sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impact of inflation for the last several years  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company s costs 
however  due to the competitive sales pressures in both the fuller brands and imaging segments  any inflation experienced has generally not been able to be passed on to the customer 
programs stressing productivity improvements  as well as group purchasing efforts should continue to offset potential negative impacts of inflation in the near future 
environmental contingency remediation efforts related to issues raised by the state of kansas when the fuller brush company was acquired in are almost complete 
although the company has not yet received final acceptance from the applicable state agencies  management believes that the company will not incur any significant  future costs related to this project 
new accounting standards in june  sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities was issued 
sfas no
