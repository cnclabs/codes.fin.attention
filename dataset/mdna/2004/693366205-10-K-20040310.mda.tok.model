item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the consolidated financial statements and other portions of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   including item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  reflect the effects of presenting sequoia insurance company and two businesses sold by hyperfeed technologies  inc as discontinued operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  discontinued operations  and presenting hyperfeed technologies  inc as a separate segment beginning may  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  consolidation of hyperfeed technologies  inc company summary  recent developments  and future outlook vidler water company  inc 
background we believe that continuing trends in nevada and arizona indicate strong future demand for vidler s water rights and water storage assets 
based on figures prepared by the nevada state demographer  in the year ended july  the population of clark county  nevada  which includes metropolitan las vegas  increased to more than million residents 
around  people are moving to the area annually 
currently las vegas takes most of its water supply from lake mead 
due to the continued growth in demand for water and years of drought  the level of lake mead has reached year lows 
accordingly  las vegas is aggressively seeking to conserve water eg  rules have been introduced restricting water use in new homes and to diversify its sources of water supply 
at the same time  the increasing cost of housing in las vegas is leading to more rapid growth in outlying areas within commuting distance 
over time  we believe that these factors will lead to demand for water in parts of southern nevada where vidler owns or has an interest in water rights  including sandy valley and muddy river in clark county  and southern lincoln county 
if growth management initiatives are introduced in las vegas  these will lead to even more rapid growth in the areas surrounding metropolitan las vegas 
in arizona  the continued growth of the municipalities surrounding phoenix in maricopa county is likely to lead to strong demand for vidler s water rights in the harquahala valley 
the arizona state demographer estimates that the population of maricopa county increased in the years from april  until july   to almost million residents 
many municipalities surrounding phoenix scottsdale do not receive allotments of water from the colorado river  and are therefore forced to find alternative supplies of water 
due to the low level of lake mead  the states of arizona  california  and nevada may be required to take no more than their current allotments of water from the colorado river 
this is likely to increase demand for the net recharge credits owned by vidler  representing water which vidler has in storage in its arizona recharge facility 
we also anticipate demand from developers and other entities to store water for various purposes  including back up water supply for dry years by developers  and assured water supply for new development projects 
the central arizona water conservation district cawcd is a three county water district servicing the most populous parts of the state  including maricopa county 
a recent cawcd study predicted that cawcd will be able to use million acre feet of water from arizona s colorado river supplies in the years from through  assuming average annual precipitation 
the cawcd also estimated that million acre feet will be required over the same period by the central arizona groundwater replenishment district  the authority responsible for protecting groundwater supplies in the cawcd three county service area 
the cawcd also estimated demand of million acre feet from the arizona water bank for various purposes eg  use in nevada  and a further million acre feet to replenish groundwater reserves 
based on these forecasts  arizona appears to be faced with a shortfall of million acre feet of water in the period through  which will require cawcd to purchase additional supplies 
the southern nevada water authority has released a master water plan which can be viewed at www 
snwa 
com to develop and deliver water supplies to meet regional growth demands 
this plan consists of the storage of water  including up to million acre feet in arizona combined with the development of further water resources in nevada 
we believe that vidler s assets are favorably positioned to contribute to the water resource solutions required in the southwest 
water rights arizona at december   vidler owned or had the right to acquire approximately  acre feet of transferable ground water in the harquahala valley  approximately miles northwest of metropolitan phoenix  arizona 
vidler owns  acre feet  and we have the option to purchase a further  acre feet 
we believe that vidler s water rights in the harquahala valley represent the most practical and competitive source of water to support the growth of greater metropolitan phoenix  which is one of the fastest growing areas in the nation 
vidler s water rights in the harquahala valley are primarily located in maricopa county 
according to census data  maricopa county was the fastest growing county in the us between april  and july   with  new homes added  an increase of in months 
vidler anticipates that there will be municipal demand for water from the harquahala valley to support the growth of the west side cities in maricopa county  which are part of greater metropolitan phoenix 
any new residential development in arizona must obtain a permit from the arizona department of water resources certifying a designated assured water supply sufficient to sustain the development for at least years 
the harquahala valley ground water meets the designation of assured water supply 
in order for the ground water to be used by municipalities in the heavily populated parts of arizona  the water must be wheeled  or transported  from the harquahala valley to the end users 
the arizona state legislature has passed legislation which allows harquahala valley ground water to be made available as assured water supply to cities and communities in arizona through agreements with the central arizona groundwater replenishment district 
the arizona state legislature has passed several pieces of legislation which recognize the harquahala valley ground water as a future municipal supply for the greater phoenix metropolitan area 
in  the expansion of irrigated farming in the valley was prohibited  and the transfer of the ground water to municipalities was authorized 
in order to protect the harquahala valley ground water from large commercial and industrial users which were moving into the basin  legislation was enacted in placing restrictions on commercial and industrial users utilizing more than acre feet of water annually 
these users are required to purchase irrigable land and to withdraw the water that they need from the land at no more than acre feet per annum per acre of land 
in and  vidler completed its first sales of harquahala valley ground water for industrial use and municipal use in march  vidler sold  acre feet of water rights and  acres of land to an industrial user  for million  in march  vidler sold  acre feet of water rights and  acres of land to golf course developers near scottsdale  for million  and in may  vidler sold acre feet of water rights and acres of land to an industrial user  for million 
vidler is working on further sales of harquahala valley ground water to both industrial users and communities and developers in the greater phoenix metropolitan area who need to secure further water to support expected growth 
nevada vidler has been increasing its ownership of water rights in northern nevada through the purchase of ranch properties and entering into joint ventures with parties owning water rights  which they wish to maximize the value of 
nevada is the state experiencing the most rapid population growth and new home construction in the united states 
the population is concentrated in southern nevada  which includes the las vegas metropolitan area 
lincoln county vidler is working jointly with lincoln county to locate and develop water resources in lincoln county  nevada 
lincoln county and vidler have filed applications for more than  acre feet of water rights with the intention of supplying water to communities and industrial users 
we believe that this is the only known new source of water for lincoln county 
vidler anticipates that up to  acre feet of water rights will ultimately be permitted from these applications  and put to use in lincoln county 
under the lincoln county land act  more than  acres of publicly owned land in southern lincoln county is to be offered for sale near the fast growing city of mesquite 
the first release of land under the lincoln county land act is expected to occur later in additional water will be required if this land is to be developed 
in  lincoln vidler filed for  acre feet of water rights for industrial use from the tule desert groundwater basin 
in november  the nevada state engineer granted an application for  acre feet of water rights  and ruled that another  acre feet could be granted  but would be held in abeyance while lincoln vidler pursues additional studies 
in  lincoln vidler reached conditional agreement to sell an electricity generating company between  and  acre feet of water  at  per acre foot  for a new power plant to be located in southern lincoln county on a site which was to be acquired from nevada land 
due to the unprecedented instability in the energy market and capital market conditions affecting the electricity sector  the electricity generating company decided not to move forward with the project 
recognizing that a permitted site with permitted water rights will have value once the energy market stabilizes  vidler purchased the project for  in february energy companies and utilities are currently reviewing the project 
the lincoln county undertaking is an example of a transaction where vidler can partner with an entity  in this case a government entity  to provide the necessary capital and skills to commercially develop water assets 
sandy valley  nevada in june  the nevada state engineer awarded vidler acre feet of water rights near sandy valley  nevada 
vidler has filed another application for  acre feet 
the water rights awarded to vidler are the only known water to support future growth in sandy valley and surrounding areas in southwestern nevada near the california state line  including primm  nevada 
primm is a resort town on the border between california and nevada  in the interstate corridor 
primm requires additional water to support future growth  which could result from expansion of the existing hotel casino and retail commercial operations 
muddy river water rights the muddy river is a perennial river fed by the muddy springs in southern nevada  originating in nevada and flowing into lake mead 
currently  muddy river water rights are utilized for agriculture and electricity generation  however  in the future  we anticipate that muddy river water rights may be utilized to support development in southern nevada 
the southern nevada water authority has been acquiring muddy river water rights as a water resource to support future growth in clark county  nevada 
at december   vidler owned approximately acre feet of muddy river water rights  and had the right to acquire an additional acre feet 
fish springs ranch in  vidler purchased a interest in fish springs ranch  llc fish springs and a interest in v b  llc 
these companies own the fish springs ranch and other properties totaling approximately  acres in honey lake valley in washoe county  miles north of reno  nevada 
approximately  acre feet of permitted water rights associated with fish springs ranch are transferable to the reno sparks area 
the water rights at fish springs have been identified as the most economical and proven new source of supply to support new growth in the north valley communities of washoe county 
this county was in the top of all counties in the us for new home construction between april  and july  according to census data  almost  new homes were constructed over that month period  a increase 
vidler is holding discussions with a number of potential users for the fish springs water rights  including developers and industrial users 
there is strong demand for water in the north valleys  and few alternative sources of supply 
the future demand of the north valleys area is estimated to exceed  acre feet annually 
if water from fish springs could be supplied to the north valleys  this would reduce their reliance on truckee river water which comes through reno  thereby providing environmental benefits and additional water to support growth in and around reno  an area which has been experiencing consistent growth 
in october  the regional water planning committee accepted the north valley water supply comparison report 
this study re evaluated the feasibility and potential cost of supplying future north valley s water demands with continued exportation of water from the truckee river basin  or  alternatively  meeting the demands from fish springs and two other basins 
the study indicated that ground water from fish springs would be the most economical source of supply 
alternatively  if the capacity of nearby transmission lines can be expanded  we believe that fish springs ranch would be an attractive site for gas fired electricity generation 
big springs ranch and west wendover  nevada in december  vidler closed on the sale of approximately  acres of deeded ranch land and the related water rights at big springs ranch for million 
the ranch land was located approximately miles east of elko  in northeastern nevada 
in december  in a separate but related transaction  vidler closed on the sale of approximately  acres of developable land near west wendover  nevada for million 
west wendover is adjacent to the nevada utah border in the interstate corridor 
the land at west wendover was acquired in through a land exchange with the bureau of land management  under which vidler gave up approximately  acres of ranch land at big springs ranch in return for the parcels of developable land 
the assets at big springs ranch and west wendover were different in nature from vidler s remaining assets in arizona and nevada  in that the land comprised the bulk of the value of big springs ranch and west wendover  with the water rights being a lesser component 
colorado vidler is completing the process of monetizing its water rights in colorado  through sale or lease in  vidler closed on the sale of various water rights and related assets to the city of golden  colorado for million  and granted the city options to acquire other water rights over the next years 
the city exercised options to acquire water assets for  in   in  and  in if the remaining options are exercised  the present value of the aggregate purchase price is approximately million  during  vidler closed on the sale of its interest in cline ranch for million and the sale of acre feet of water rights for million  and in  vidler closed on the sale of the wet mountain water rights for discussions are continuing to either lease or sell the remaining water rights in colorado 
water storage vidler arizona recharge facility during  vidler completed the second stage of construction at its facility to bank  or store  water underground in the harquahala valley  and received the necessary permits to operate a full scale water recharge facility 
recharge is the process of placing water into storage underground 
vidler has the permitted right to recharge  acre feet of water per year at the vidler arizona recharge facility  and anticipates being able to store in excess of million acre feet of water in the aquifer underlying much of the valley 
when needed  the water will be recovered  or removed from storage  by ground water wells 
vidler has the only permitted  complete private water storage facility in arizona 
given that arizona is the only southwestern state with surplus flows of water available for storage  we believe that vidler s is the only private water storage facility where it is practical to bank  or store  water for users in other states  which is known as interstate banking 
having a permitted water storage facility also allows vidler to acquire  and store  surplus water for re sale in future years 
the vidler arizona recharge facility is the first privately owned water storage facility for the colorado river system  which is a primary source of water for the lower division states of arizona  california  and nevada 
the water storage facility is strategically located adjacent to the central arizona project cap aqueduct  a conveyance canal running from lake havasu to phoenix and tucson 
the water to be recharged will come from surplus flows of cap water 
we believe that proximity to the cap is a competitive advantage  because it minimizes the cost of water conveyance 
vidler is able to provide storage for users located both within arizona and out of state 
potential users include industrial companies  developers  and local governmental political subdivisions in arizona  and out of state users such as municipalities and water agencies in nevada and california 
the arizona water banking authority awba has the responsibility for intrastate and interstate storage of water for governmental entities 
vidler intends to charge customers a fee based on the amount of water recharged  and then an additional fee when the water is recovered 
the revenues generated from this asset will depend on the quantity of water which the awba  and private users  store at the facility 
the quantity of water stored will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of water and available storage capacity at publicly owned facilities 
we believe that a number of events in recent years have increased the scarcity value of the project s storage capacity 
at a public hearing in march  the awba disclosed that the bureau of reclamation has indicated that  before permits are issued for new facilities to store water for interstate users  extensive environmental impact studies will be required 
the awba also indicated that the first priority for publicly owned storage capacity in arizona is to store water for arizona users 
at the same hearing  the states of california and nevada again confirmed that their demand for storage far exceeds the total amount of storage available at existing facilities in arizona 
consequently  interstate users will need to rely  at least in part  on privately owned storage capacity 
the southern nevada water authority water resource plan  which can be viewed at www 
snwa 
com  calls for million acre feet of water to be stored in arizona in order to meet forecast demand 
the awba is currently finalizing agreements to store water on behalf of nevada 
once these agreements have been concluded  the awba can begin to negotiate storage for california 
the awba will be able to store water at existing publicly owned sites and at the vidler arizona recharge facility  which is one of the largest water storage facilities 
under the current agreement  which expires in  vidler has agreed on a price of per acre foot of water recharged for users represented by the awba 
in addition to the potential demand from the public users represented by the awba  demand from private users could potentially utilize up to of the site s storage capacity 
vidler has not yet stored water for customers at the facility  but the company has been recharging water for its own account since  when the pilot plant was constructed 
in  vidler had net recharge credits representing approximately  acre feet of water in storage at the facility  and had purchased a further  acre feet which was recharged in as well as ordering an additional  acre feet for purchase and recharge in vidler purchased the water from the cap  and intends to resell this water at an appropriate time 
vidler is in discussions with a number of developers and other entities  which could lead to the sale of the water that we have stored on our own account  and to storing additional water 
once vidler has concluded agreements to store water  it will know the rate at which customers will need to be able to recover water 
at that time  vidler will be able to design  construct  and finance the final stage of the project which will allow full scale recovery 
the users of the facility will bear the capital cost of the improvements required to recover water at commercial rates 
vidler anticipates being able to recharge  acre feet of water per year at the facility  and to store in excess of million acre feet of water in the aquifer 
vidler s estimate of the aquifer s storage volume is primarily based on a hydrological report prepared by an independent engineering firm for the central arizona water conservation district in  which concluded that there is storage capacity of million acre feet 
recharge and recovery capacity is critical  because it indicates how quickly water can be put into storage or recovered from storage 
in wet years  it is important to have a high recharge capacity  so that as much available water as possible may be stored 
in dry years  the crucial factor is the ability to recover water as quickly as possible 
there is a long history of farmers recovering significant quantities of water from the harquahala valley ground water aquifer for irrigation purposes 
semitropic vidler originally had an right to participate in the semitropic water banking and exchange program  which operates a  acre foot water storage facility at semitropic  near the california aqueduct  northwest of bakersfield  california 
the strategic value of the guaranteed right to recover an amount of water from semitropic every year even in drought years became clear to water agencies  developers  and other parties seeking a reliable water supply 
for example  developers of large residential projects in kern county and los angeles county must now be able to demonstrate that they have sufficient back up supplies of water in the case of a drought year before they are permitted to begin development 
accordingly  during  vidler took advantage of current demand for water storage capacity with guaranteed recovery  and began to sell its interest in semitropic 
the strategic value of the guaranteed right to recover water was again highlighted by two court decisions in february which held that developers could not rely on water from state water projects 
in may  vidler closed the sale of of its original interest ie  approximately  acre feet of water storage capacity to the newhall land and farming company for million  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
this transaction added million to revenues and segment income in in september  vidler closed the sale of another of its original interest ie  approximately  acre feet of water storage capacity to the alameda county water district for million  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
this transaction added million to revenues and segment income in vidler s remaining interest includes approximately  acre feet of storage capacity 
we have the guaranteed right to recover a minimum of approximately  acre feet every year 
in some circumstances  we have the right to recover up to approximately  acre feet in any one year 
we are considering various alternatives for the remaining interest  including sale to developers or industrial users 
currently vidler is not storing any water at semitropic for third parties 
vidler is required to make annual payments of  under its agreement with semitropic water storage district 
other projects vidler routinely evaluates the purchase of further water righted properties in arizona and nevada 
vidler also continues to be approached by parties who are interested in obtaining a water supply  or discussing joint ventures to commercially develop water assets and or develop water storage facilities in arizona  nevada  and other southwestern states 
we have the resources and relationships to respond to business opportunities which are consistent with our strategic objectives 
nevada land resource company  llc the majority of nevada land s revenues come from the sale of land and the related water rights 
in addition  various types of recurring revenue are generated from use of the nevada land s properties  including leasing  easements  and mineral royalties 
nevada land also generates interest revenue from land sales contracts where nevada land has provided partial financing  and from temporary investment of the proceeds of land sales 
nevada land recognizes revenue from land sales  and the resulting gross profit or loss  when transactions close 
on closing  the entire sales price is recorded as revenue  and a gross margin is recognized depending on the cost basis attributed to the land which was sold 
since the date of closing determines the accounting period in which the sales revenue and gain are recorded  nevada land s reported revenues and income fluctuate from period to period  depending on the dates when specific transactions close 
in  nevada land generated million in revenues from the sale of  acres of former railroad land  indicating on going demand 
the average sales price of per acre compares to our average basis of per acre in the parcels which were sold 
included in land sales were approximately  acres of desert and mountainous land which biased the average sales price and average basis downwards  but resulted in a gross margin in the typical range 
in  of land sales were settled for cash  and nevada land provided partial financing for the remainder 
vendor financing is collateralized by the land conveyed  typically carries a interest rate  and is subject to a minimum down payment 
business acquisitions and financing this section describes the most significant interests in public companies included in this segment during excluding hyperfeed  which became a consolidated subsidiary during the year  we estimate that the common stock interests in public companies reported in this segment generated a total return ie  realized and unrealized gains  plus dividends received  in us dollars of approximately in hyperfeed technologies  inc 
in   and until may  pico s investment in hyperfeed common shares was recorded in this segment using the equity method under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
since may   when hyperfeed became a consolidated subsidiary  its results have been recorded in a separate segment  hyperfeed technologies  however  pico s investment in hyperfeed warrants is still recorded in the business acquisitions and financing segment 
after adjusting for hyperfeed s reverse stock split in august  pico holds warrants to buy approximately  shares of hyperfeed common stock at an average price of per share  exercisable by april at december   the price of hyperfeed s common stock was  and the warrants were carried at estimated fair value of  jungfraubahn holding ag pico owns  shares of jungfraubahn  which represents approximately of that company 
at december   the market carrying value of our holding was million 
in september  we increased our holding to of jungfraubahn  and became the largest shareholder in that company 
despite the increase in our shareholding to more than  we continue to account for this investment under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
at this time  we do not believe that we have the requisite ability to exercise significant influence over the financial and operating policies of jungfraubahn  and therefore do not apply the equity method of accounting 
in february  jungfraubahn issued a press release containing an initial review of operations  using swiss accounting principles 
the full text is available on jungfraubahn s website www 
jungfraubahn 
com 
the contents of jungfraubahn s website are not incorporated in this k 
in the press release  jungfraubahn indicated that it expected transport revenues of approximately chf swiss francs million us million for  a increase year over year 
in the first six months of  jungfraubahn s results were affected by a decrease in group travel  particularly from japan and the us  resulting from a reluctance to travel due to the iraq war and the respiratory disease sars 
during the summer  the shortfall was partly made up by increased numbers of passengers from switzerland and other european countries 
in the first half of  the number of visitors to jungfraujoch top of europe declined year over year  however  for the full year  passenger numbers were only down  illustrating a recovery in the second half of in september  jungfraubahn announced its results for the six months to june  reported revenues were chf million us million 
net income was chf million us million  or approximately chf per share us  a increase year over year 
jungfraubahn announced its results for the financial year in may  so the results will not be released until after this k has been filed 
revenues were chf million us million  and net income was chf million us million  or chf per share us 
jungfraubahn s operating activities generated net cash flow of chf million us million 
in the most recent published balance sheet december  jungfraubahn had shareholders equity of chf million  or approximately chf us book value per share 
at december   jungfraubahn s stock price was chf us 
at december   jungfraubahn s stock price was chf us 
other european investments raetie energie ag pico owns  shares in raetie energie  which is a producer of hydro electricity 
at december   our investment in raetia energie had a basis of million  and a market value of million 
during  the market price of raetia stock increased by in swiss francs  and the carrying value of our holding appreciated by million  or almost  in us dollars 
we first purchased this stock in  and increased our holding in   and over the life of the investment so far  we have generated a total return ie  realized and unrealized gains  plus dividends received in us dollars upwards of 
accu holding ag pico has acquired  shares in accu holding for million  which represents a voting ownership interest of approximately 
due to a number of factors  we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over accu holding s activities  so the investment is carried at market value under sfas no 
accu holding manufactures batteries at two plants in switzerland 
accu is adjusting its production and cost structure following a decline in demand for batteries during the economic slowdown 
accu is also preparing to redevelop the site of a former factory near zurich  which could have significant value 
we have agreed to support a capital raising by accu  which we expect to occur in swiss franc funds equivalent to our maximum commitment of us million chf million are held in a separate bank account 
sihl in and  we acquired approximately of sihl for million  through participation in a restructuring capital raising and open market purchases 
our investment in sihl is accounted for under sfas no 
at the time  sihl s core business was digital imaging  but the company had surplus property assets in and around zurich  including a major development project known as sihlcity 
sihl s operations were adversely affected by the economic downturn in late and  and sihl was unable to improve profitability and reduce debt as previously expected 
in  sihl sold its core business  and announced a debt restructuring with its banks which assures the shareholders of a return in certain circumstances 
as more fully explained in the business financing and acquisitions portion of results of operations years ended december   and  we regularly review stocks which have declined in price from our cost 
if we determine that the decline in market value is other than temporary  we record a charge which writes our basis in the investment down from its original cost to current carrying value  which typically is the market price at the balance sheet date when the provision is recorded 
it should be noted that charges for other than temporary impairments do not affect shareholders equity or book value per share  since the after tax decline in the market value of investments carried under sfas no 
is already reflected in shareholders equity in our balance sheet 
also  the carrying book value of the holding does not change 
if the stock price subsequently recovers  the basis does not change 
due to the extent and duration of the decline in the market value of sihl stock  we recorded pre tax charges for other than temporary impairment of our holding in sihl of million in  million in  and  in at december   the charges for other than temporary impairment had reduced our basis in sihl to  compared to the carrying market value of the holding of  given the extent and duration of the decline in the market price of accu stock  we determined that the decline in accu s market value is also other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded pre tax charges for other than temporary impairment of our holding in accu of million in  and  in the first nine months of these charges were recorded as realized losses and reduced the basis of the investment 
at december   the holding had a market carrying value of million chf million 
insurance operations in run off typically  most of the revenues of an insurance company in run off come from investment income ie  interest from fixed income securities and dividends from stocks earned on funds held as part of their insurance business 
in addition  from time to time  gains or losses are realized from the sale of investments 
in broad terms  physicians and citation hold cash and fixed income securities corresponding to their loss reserves  and the excess is invested in value stocks in the us and selected foreign markets 
given the very low level of interest rates  we expect to generate limited income and no capital gains from our bond holdings 
to maintain liquidity and to guard against capital losses which would be brought on by higher interest rates  we have increased our holdings of bonds maturing in years or less 
at december   the duration of citation s bond portfolio was years  and the duration of the physicians bond portfolio was years 
the duration of a bond portfolio measures the amount of time it will take for the cash flows from scheduled interest payments and the maturity of bonds to equal the current value of the portfolio 
duration indicates the sensitivity of the market value of a bond portfolio to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase  the market value of existing bonds will decline 
during periods when market interest rates decline  such as   and  the market value of existing bonds increases 
typically  the longer the duration  the greater the sensitivity of the value of the bond portfolio to changes in interest rates 
duration of less than years is generally regarded as short term 
we hold bonds issued by the us treasury and government sponsored enterprises eg  freddie mac and fnma only to the extent required for capital under state insurance codes  or as required for deposits or collateral with state regulators 
otherwise  the bond portfolios consist almost entirely of investment grade corporate issues with or less years to maturity 
as of december   none of our bond holdings had declined significantly from cost 
we do not own any municipal bonds  and did not own any corporate bonds in the telecommunications  technology  utilities  energy trading  automotive  and consumer finance sectors  or conglomerates which experienced difficulties in recent years 
the equities component of the insurance company portfolios is concentrated on a limited number of asset rich small capitalization value stocks in the us these positions have been accumulated at a significant discount to our estimate of the private market value of each company s underlying hard assets ie  land and other tangible assets 
the insurance company portfolios also have a degree of international diversification through holdings of small capitalization value stocks in new zealand and australia  and selected large capitalization resource stocks with world class mining operations in foreign countries 
dividends and realized gains or losses from stocks held in the insurance company portfolios are reported in the insurance operations in run off segment 
in  we estimate that the total return on the fixed income securities and unaffiliated common stocks in citation s portfolio was approximately  including better than for the stocks component of the portfolio at december  we estimate that the total return on the fixed income securities and unaffiliated common stocks in physicians portfolio was approximately in  including better than for the stocks component of the portfolio at december  the investment income  and therefore revenue  of a run off insurance company is expected to decline over time as fixed income investments mature or are sold to provide the funds to pay down the company s claims reserves 
unless there is adverse development in prior year loss reserves  typically the expenses of an insurance company in run off will be lower than the expenses of an insurance company which is actively writing business 
the financial results of insurance companies in run off can be volatile if there is favorable or unfavorable development in the loss reserves 
physicians recorded significant income from favorable reserve development in and  however  citation recorded a significant loss in  partly due to increases in the workers compensation and property and casualty insurance loss reserves 
physicians insurance company of ohio physicians wrote its last policy in  however  claims can be filed until resulting from events allegedly occurring during the period when physicians provided coverage 
by its nature  medical professional liability insurance involves a relatively small number frequency of relatively large severity claims 
we have purchased excess of loss reinsurance to limit our potential losses 
the amount of risk we have retained on each claim varies depending on the accident year but  in general  we are liable for the first million to million per claim 
due to the long tail ie  period of time between the occurrence of the alleged event giving rise to the claim  and the claim being reported to us in the medical professional liability insurance business  it is difficult to accurately quantify future claims liabilities and establish appropriate loss reserves 
our loss reserves  which are reviewed by management every quarter and are assessed in the fourth quarter of each year  based on independent actuarial analysis of past  current  and projected claims trends in the months ended september of each year 
at december   medical professional liability reserves totaled million  net of reinsurance  compared to million net of reinsurance at december   and million net of reinsurance at december  physicians insurance company of ohio loss and loss adjustment expense reserves year ended december  direct reserves million million million ceded reserves net medical professional liability insurance reserves million million million at december   our direct reserves  or reserves before reinsurance  essentially equaled the independent actuary s best estimate 
the independent actuary is continually reviewing our claims experience and projected claims trends in order to arrive at the most accurate estimate possible 
the independent actuary did not explicitly forecast a range of reserves  but arrived at a best estimate through weighting the results of five different projection methods for each accident year  and in total 
under the different projection methods  the lowest direct reserve calculation was approximately million  and the highest direct reserve calculation was million 
consequently  our loss reserves could be materially different depending on the particular method of calculation chosen 
changes in assumptions about future claim trends  and the cost of handling claims  could lead to significant increases and decreases in our loss reserves 
when loss reserves are reduced  this is referred to as favorable development 
if loss reserves are increased  the development is referred to as adverse or unfavorable 
at december   approximately million  or of our direct reserves were case reserves  which are the loss reserves established when a claim is reported to us

during  physicians continued to experience favorable trends in the severity size of claims  and  to a lesser extent  the frequency number of claims 
consequently  independent actuarial analysis of physicians loss reserves concluded that physicians reserves against claims were significantly greater than the actuary s projections of future claims payments 
reserves were reduced in all of physicians accident years from until  resulting in a net reduction of approximately million  or of reserves at the start of the year 
the net reduction in reserves of approximately million was primarily due to a decrease in claims severity  physicians reduced its reserve for ibnr claims by approximately million  which was partially offset by a  increase in the provision for unallocated loss adjustment expense which effectively recognizes the cost of handling physicians claims over the remaining run off 
as shown in the table above  in physicians made million in net indemnity payments to close cases  an average indemnity payment of  per case 
although total claims payments in were less than anticipated  the average indemnity payment is higher than in recent years due to the mix of cases closed in we are projecting a decrease in severity in future years at december   the average case reserve per open claim was approximately there were no changes in key actuarial assumption in it should be noted that such actuarial analyses involves estimation of future trends in many factors which may vary significantly from expectation  which could lead to further reserve adjustments either increases or decreases in future years

during  our medical professional liability insurance claims reserves  net of reinsurance  decreased million  from million to million 
loss and loss adjustment expense payments for the year were approximately million  accounting for of the net decrease in reserves during due to continued favorable trends in the severity size of claims  and  to a lesser extent  the frequency number of claims  independent actuarial analysis of physicians loss reserves concluded that physicians reserves against claims were greater than the actuary s projections of future claims payments 
reserves were increased in of physicians accident years from until by million  and reduced in the other accident years by million  resulting in a net reduction of approximately million  or of reserves at the start of the year 
there were no changes in key actuarial assumption in during  our medical professional liability insurance claims reserves  net of reinsurance  decreased million  from million to million 
loss and loss adjustment expense payments for the year were million  accounting for of the net decrease in reserves during actuarial analysis of physicians loss reserves concluded that physicians reserves against claims were significantly greater than the actuary s projections of future claims payments in of accident years  due to favorable trends in both the frequency and severity of claims 
consequently  physicians reduced its reserve for ibnr claims by approximately million  which accounted for the remaining of the net decrease in reserves for the year 
there was a change in a key actuarial assumption in when estimating the reserves required for losses greater than  per claim  the independent actuary began to use physicians own claims experience  rather than industry averages 
since physicians own experience had been less severe than the industry averages  the actuary reduced the reserves required for losses in excess of  per claim  which contributed to the reduction in reserves 
in reaching the best estimate  the appointed actuary also took note of both a decrease in the number of open claims  and favorable development in known claims during since it is almost eight years since physicians wrote its last policy  and the direct ibnr claims reserve at december  is million million net of reinsurance  it is conceivable that further favorable development could be recorded in future years if claims trends remain favorable  particularly claims severity 
however  given that favorable development of million was recognized in  there is less potential for favorable development in future years than there has been in the past 
in addition  we caution that claims can be reported until  and against over emphasizing claims count statistics for example  the last claims to be resolved by a run off insurance company could be the most complex and the most severe 
citation insurance company property and casualty insurance loss reserves citation went into run off from january  at december   after three years of run off  citation had million in property and casualty insurance loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  after reinsurance 
approximately of citation s net property and casualty insurance reserves are related to one line of business  artisans contractors liability insurance 
the remaining is comprised of commercial property and casualty insurance policies all of which expired in as a general rule  based on state statutes of limitations  we believe that no new commercial property and casualty insurance claims can be filed in california and arizona 
however  in certain limited circumstances  claims filing periods may be extended 
we have purchased excess of loss reinsurance to limit our potential losses 
the amount of risk we have retained on each claim varies depending on the accident year  but we can be liable for the first  to  per claim 
citation wrote artisans contractors insurance until  the year before physicians merged with citation s parent company 
no artisans contractors business was renewed after the merger 
artisans contractors liability insurance has been a problematic line of business for all insurers who offered this type of coverage in california during the s and s 
california experienced a severe recession in the early s  which caused a steep downturn in real estate values 
in an attempt to improve their position  many homeowners filed claims against developers of new home communities and condominiums  and related parties such as general contractors  for alleged construction defects 
citation s average loss ratio ie  the cost of making provision to pay claims as a percentage of earned premium for all years from to for this insurance coverage is over 
the nature of this line of business is that we receive a large number high frequency of small low severity claims 
citation primarily insured subcontractors  and only rarely insured general contractors 
a large percentage of the claims received in and related to additional insured endorsements aie 
in general  these represent claims from general contractors who were not direct policyholders of citation s  but were named as insureds on policies issued to citation s subcontractor policyholders 
most of citation s subcontractor insureds are not initially named as defendants in construction defect law suits  but are drawn into litigation against general contractors  typically when the general contractor s legal expenses reach the limit of their own insurance policy 
the courts have held that subcontractors who performed only a minor role in the construction can be held in on complicated litigation against general contractors 
accordingly  the cost of legal defenses can be as significant as claims payments 
typically  aei claims are shared among more than one subcontractor and more than one insurance carrier 
this reduces the expense to any one carrier  so aei claims typically involve smaller claims payments than claims from actual policyholders 
although citation wrote its last artisans contractors policy in and the statute of limitations in california is years  this can be extended in some situations 
over the past years  the trends in open claims and claims paid in the artisans contractors line of business has been year ended december  open claims at the start of the year new claims reported during the year claims closed during the year open claims at the end of the year total claims closed during the year claims closed with no payment claims closed with lae payment only no indemnity payment claims closed with an indemnity payment due to the long tail ie  period between the occurrence of the alleged event giving rise to the claim and the claim being reported to us in the artisans contractors line of business  it is difficult to accurately quantify future claims liabilities and establish appropriate loss reserves 
our loss reserves are reviewed at september and december of each year by an independent actuary who issues an opinion annually  as required by california state law 
the independent actuary analyzes past  current  and projected claims trends for all active accident years  using several forecasting methods 
the appointed actuary believes this will result in more accurate reserve estimates than using a single method 
we typically book our reserves to the actuary s best estimate  or above the actuary s best estimate 
changes in assumptions about future claim trends and the cost of handling claims can lead to significant increases and decreases in our loss property and casualty reserves 
due to the large number of claims received in the artisans contractors line of business in   and  citation was forced to increase its reserves in each of those years 
citation reduced claims reserves net of reinsurance by  in  but increased reserves by  in in both cases  the reserve changes were less than of beginning reserves 
in  primarily due to reduced severity of claims as described in preceding paragraphs  citation reduced reserves by  representing a change in beginning reserves 
however  in citation increased reserves by  or of beginning reserves  primarily due to the increased number of new claims received higher frequency 
there were no changes in key actuarial assumptions during   and see critical accounting policies and risk factors 
at december   citation s net property and casualty reserves were carried at million  approximately  more than the actuary s best estimate 
given the uncertainties inherent in projecting trends in loss development  we elected to set higher reserves than the actuary s best estimate  to partially guard against unexpected reserve increases in future years if claims experience deteriorates

following actuarial analysis during  citation increased loss reserves by  due to adverse development in the artisans contractors book of business resulting from an increased frequency of new claims 
during  citation s property and casualty insurance claims reserves  net of reinsurance  decreased from million to million 
claims payments for the year were million  accounting for approximately of the net decrease in reserves during actuarial analysis of citations loss reserves as of december  showed a redundancy in the carried reserves of citation  which we reduced during by  the reserve redundancy reflected a reduction in the severity size of claims 
during  citation s property and casualty insurance claims reserves  net of reinsurance  decreased from million to million 
claims payments for prior years reduced reserves by million  and essentially accounted for the net reduction in reserves for the year 
this was partially offset by  in incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses for the accident year 
a  increase in prior year loss reserves was recorded 
it should be noted that such actuarial analyses involves estimation of future trends in many factors which may vary significantly from expectation  which could lead to further reserve adjustments either increases or decreases in future years 
workers compensation loss reserves until  citation was a direct writer of workers compensation insurance in california  arizona  and nevada 
in  citation reinsured of its workers compensation business with a subsidiary  citation national insurance company cnic  and sold cnic to fremont indemnity company fremont 
as part of the sale of cnic  all assets and liabilities  including the assets which corresponded to the workers compensation reserves reinsured with cnic  and all records  computer systems  policy files  and reinsurance arrangements were transferred to fremont 
fremont merged cnic into fremont  and administered and paid all of the workers compensation claims which it had been sold to it 
since  citation has booked the losses reported by fremont but recorded an equal and offsetting reinsurance recoverable from fremont as an admitted reinsurer for all losses and loss adjustment expenses 
this resulted in no net impact on citation s reserves and financial statements 
on july   the california superior court placed fremont in liquidation 
since fremont is in liquidation  it is no longer an admitted reinsurance company under the statutory basis of insurance accounting 
consequently  citation reversed the reinsurance recoverable from fremont of approximately million in its financial statements prepared on both the statutory basis and gaap basis in the three months ended june  citation is pursuing its rights to recover the reinsurance  and to recover deposits reported as held by fremont for citation s insureds to utilize against the workers compensation claims obligations  however  the ultimate outcome cannot be accurately predicted 
workers compensation has been a problematic line of business for all insurers who offered this type of coverage in california during the s 
we believe that this is primarily due to claims costs escalating at a greater than anticipated rate  in particular for medical care 
the nature of this line of business is that we receive a relatively small number low frequency of relatively large high severity claims 
although the last of citation s workers compensation policies expired in  new workers compensation claims can still be filed for events which allegedly occurred during the term of the policy 
the state statute of limitations is years  but claims filing periods may be extended in some circumstances 
at december   citation had open workers compensation claims 
few new claims have been filed in the past years 
since citation ceased writing workers compensation coverage years ago  most of the claims which are still open tend to be severe  and likely to lead to claims payments for a prolonged period of time 
at december   citation had workers compensation reserves of million before reinsurance  and million after reinsurance 
citation purchased excess reinsurance to limit its potential losses in this line of business 
in general  we have retained the risk on the first  to  per claim 
the workers compensation reserves are reinsured with general reinsurance  a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway  inc citation insurance company workers compensation loss and loss adjustment expense reserves december  direct reserves million ceded reserves net reserves million it is difficult to accurately quantify future claims liabilities and establish appropriate loss reserves in the workers compensation line of business due to the long tail ie  period between the occurrence of the alleged event giving rise to the claim and the claim being reported to us  and the extended period over which policy benefits are paid 
our workers compensation loss reserves were reviewed at september  and december  by an independent actuary who issues an opinion annually  as required by california state law 
the independent actuary analyzes past  current  and projected claims trends for all active accident years  using several forecasting methods 
the appointed actuary believes this will result in more accurate reserve estimates than using a single method 
our reserves are typically booked at close to the actuary s best estimate 
in previous years  we booked the direct reserves and an equal offsetting reinsurance recoverable based on reports provided by fremont 
changes in assumptions about future trends in claims and the cost of handling claims can lead to significant increases and decreases in our loss reserves 
when the fremont reinsurance recoverable was reversed after fremont went into liquidation  our workers compensation reserves were approximately million 
following independent actuarial analysis at september  and december   citation increased its workers compensation loss reserves by million  or approximately of the initial million in reserves 
this adverse development was primarily as a result of setting reserves at a more realistic level than fremont had previously carried them based on management and actuarial review and assessment of claims files after fremont had been placed in liquidation 
there can be no assurance that our workers compensation reserves will not develop adversely in the future  particularly if medical care costs continue to inflate 
the change in citation s reserves during resulted from citation insurance company change in workers compensation loss and loss adjustment expense reserves year ended december  beginning net reserves million reversal of reinsurance recoverable from fremont adjusted beginning net reserves million re estimation of prior year loss reserves net workers compensation insurance reserves million re estimation as a percentage of adjusted beginning reserves there were no changes in key actuarial assumptions during it should be noted that such actuarial analyses involves estimation of future trends in many factors which may vary significantly from expectation  which could lead to further reserve adjustments either increases or decreases in future years 
see critical accounting policies and risk factors 
at december   citation s net workers compensation reserves were carried at million  approximately  below the actuary s best estimate 
approximately million of citation s net workers compensation reserves were case reserves  million represented provision for ibnr claims  and the unallocated loss adjustment expense reserve was million 
currently  the workers compensation claims are being handled by a third party administrator 
hyperfeed technologies during  hyperfeed continued to restructure operations  which culminated in the sale of two business units in june  hyperfeed sold its retail trading business  pcquote 
com  for approximately  and in november  hyperfeed sold its consolidated market data feed service contracts for million 
hyperfeed recorded a gain on the sale of million in through these disposals  hyperfeed exited two low margin businesses  and replaced the business with revenues from providing products and services to the purchasers 
in addition  the sale of the businesses will reduce hyperfeed s operating expenses  and receipt of the sale proceeds has strengthened the balance sheet 
now  hyperfeed is purely a developer and provider of software  ticker plant technologies  and managed services to the financial markets industry 
in a november  press release  hyperfeed indicated that it expects to generate long term revenues from providing products and services to customers such as the chicago board options exchange  moneyline telerate  and interactive data corporation 
the release also indicated that  following the disposals hyperfeed expects to realize an million annual reduction in overhead 
at december   hyperfeed had million in cash and cash equivalents

critical accounting policies pico s principal assets and activities comprise vidler and nevada land s land  water rights  and water storage operations  the run off of property and casualty insurance  workers compensation  and medical professional liability insurance loss reserves  and business acquisitions and financing 
following is a description of what we believe to be the critical accounting policies affecting pico  and how we apply these policies 
estimation of reserves in insurance companies we must estimate future claims and ensure that our loss reserves are adequate to pay those claims 
this process requires us to make estimates about future events 
the accuracy of these estimates will not be known for many years 
for example  part of our claims reserves cover ibnr claims ie  the event giving rise to the claim has occurred  but the claim has not been reported to us 
in other words  in the case of ibnr claims  we must provide for claims which we do not know about yet 
at december   the loss reserves  net of reinsurance  of our two insurance subsidiaries were citation  million  and physicians  million 
physicians wrote its last policy in however  under current law  claims can be made until for events which allegedly occurred during the periods when we provided insurance coverage to medical professionals 
our medical professional liability insurance reserves are certified annually by an independent actuary  as required by ohio insurance law 
actuarial estimates of our future claims obligations have been volatile 
in  there was a million reduction after independent actuarial studies concluded that physicians claims reserves were greater than projected claims payments 
in there was a million net reduction in claims reserves  and in we reduced claims reserves by million 
there can be no assurance that our claims reserves are adequate and that there will not be reserve increases or decreases in the future 
as required by california insurance law  citation s loss reserves are reviewed quarterly  and certified annually  by an independent actuarial firm 
in addition  we have to make judgments about the recoverability of reinsurance owed to us on direct claims reserves 
in making this assessment  we carefully review the creditworthiness of reinsurers  as well as relying on schedules in statutory filings with state departments of insurance which show separate deposits held as assets for the benefit of reinsureds 
as discussed on preceding pages in the insurance operations in run off section of item  during we booked a reversal of reinsurance recoverable of approximately million from fremont indemnity company  as it is uncertain whether we can recover the corresponding deposit assets in the fremont liquidation 
if we cannot reach a satisfactory resolution  we plan to take legal action against the california department of insurance  as we believe that we have very strong arguments which could enable us to recover the deposit assets 
however  for accounting purposes  due to the inherent uncertainties in attempting to recover the deposit assets in this situation  we have adopted a prudent policy  consistent with the principles of our accounting policies  and fully reserved against the reinsurance recoverable from fremont related to the workers compensation claims reserves 
see insurance operations in run off and regulatory insurance disclosure in item carrying value of long lived assets our principal long lived assets are land  water rights  and interests in water storage operations owned by vidler  and land at nevada land 
at december   the total carrying value of land  water rights  and interests in water storage assets was million  or of pico s total assets 
as required by gaap  our long lived assets are reviewed regularly to ensure that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from these assets will at least recover their carrying value 
our management conducts these reviews utilizing the most recent information available  however  the review process inevitably involves the significant use of estimates and assumptions  especially the estimated market values of our real estate and water assets 
in our water rights and water storage business  we develop some projects and assets from scratch 
this can require cash outflows eg  to drill wells to prove that water is available in situations where there is no guarantee that the project will ultimately be commercially viable 
if we determine that it is probable that the project will be commercially viable  the costs of developing the asset are capitalized ie  recorded as an asset in our balance sheet  rather than being charged as an expense 
if the project ends up being viable  in the case of a sale  the capitalized costs are included in the cost of land and water rights sold and applied against the purchase price 
in the case of a lease transaction or when the asset is fully developed and ready for use  the capitalized costs are amortized ie  charged as an expense in our income statement and match any related revenues 
if we determine that the carrying value of an asset cannot be justified by the forecast future cash flows of that asset  the carrying value of the asset is written down to fair value immediately  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accounting for investments and investments in unconsolidated affiliates at december   pico and its subsidiaries held equities with a carrying value of approximately million 
these holdings are primarily small capitalization value stocks listed in the us  switzerland  australia  and new zealand 
depending on the circumstances  and our judgment about the level of our involvement with the investee company  we apply one of two accounting policies 
in the case of most holdings  we apply statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
under this method  the investment is carried at market value in our balance sheet  with unrealized gains or losses being included in shareholders equity  and the only income recorded being from dividends 
in the case of investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the company we have invested in  we apply the equity method under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the application of the equity method apb no 
to an investment may result in a different outcome in our financial statements than market value accounting sfas no 

the most significant difference between the two policies is that  under the equity method  we include our proportionate share of the investee s earnings or losses in our statement of operations  and dividends received are used to reduce the carrying value of the investment in our balance sheet 
under market value accounting  the only income recorded is from dividends 
the assessment of what constitutes the ability to exercise significant influence requires our management to make significant judgments 
we look at various factors in making this determination 
these include our percentage ownership of voting stock  whether or not we have representation on the investee company s board of directors  transactions between us and the investee  the ability to obtain timely quarterly financial information  and whether pico management can affect the operating and financial policies of the investee company 
when we conclude that we have this kind of influence  we adopt the equity method and change all of our previously reported results from the investee to show the investment as if we had applied equity accounting from the date of our first purchase 
this adds volatility to our reported results 
the use of market value accounting or the equity method can result in significantly different carrying values at specific balance sheet dates  and contributions to our statement of operations in any individual year during the course of the investment 
the total impact of the investment on pico s shareholders equity over the entire life of the investment will be the same whichever method is adopted 
for equity and debt securities accounted for under sfas no 
which are in an unrealized loss position in local currency terms  we regularly review whether the decline in market value is other than temporary 
in general  this review requires management to consider several factors  including specific adverse conditions affecting the investee s business and industry  the financial condition of the investee  the long term prospects of the investee  and the extent and duration of the decline in market value of the investee 
accordingly  management has to make important assumptions regarding our intent and ability to hold the security  and our assessment of the overall worth of the security 
risks and uncertainties in our methodology for reviewing unrealized losses for other than temporary declines include our judgments regarding the overall worth of the issuer and its long term prospects  and our ability to realize on our assessment of the overall worth of the business 
in a subsequent quarterly review  if we conclude that an unrealized loss previously determined to be temporary is other than temporary  an impairment loss will be recorded 
the other than temporary impairment charge will have no impact on shareholders equity or book value per share  as the decline in market value will already have been recorded through shareholders equity 
however  there will be an impact on income before and after tax and on our reported earnings per share  due to recognition of the unrealized loss and related tax effects 
when a charge for other than temporary impairment is recorded  our basis in the security is decreased 
consequently  if the market value of the security later recovers and we sell the security  a correspondingly greater gain will be recorded in the statement of operations 
these accounting treatments add volatility to our statements of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on the sale of land  water  and water rights based on the guidance of fasb specifically we recognize revenue when a there is a legally binding sale contract  b the profit is determinable ie  the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured  or any amount that will not be collectable can be estimated  c the earnings process is virtually complete ie  we are not obliged to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit  meaning we have transferred all risks and rewards to the buyer  and d the buyer s initial and continuing investment are sufficient to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property 
if any of these conditions are not met  we use the deposit method of accounting 
under the deposit method of accounting  until the conditions to fully recognize a sale are met  payments received from the buyer are recorded as liabilities and no gain is recognized 
results of operations years ended december    and shareholders equity at december   pico had shareholders equity of million per share  compared to million per share at the end of  and million per share at the end of book value per share increased in  and in the principal factors leading to the million increase in shareholders equity during were the net increases of million in unrealized appreciation in investments and  in foreign currency translation 
these factors were partially offset by the million net loss and a  increase in treasury stock due to the purchase of pico shares in deferred compensation plans for directors 
balance sheet total assets at december  were million  compared to million at december  during  total assets decreased by million and total liabilities decreased by million  primarily due to the sale of sequoia during at december   our balance sheet included million in assets and million of liabilities related to sequoia 
the most notable change on the asset side of the balance sheet is an increase in equity securities from million at december   to million at december  if the equity securities held by sequoia which were transferred to physicians as part of the sale of sequoia are included in the total  equity securities increased from million to million during approximately of the million adjusted year over year increase is attributable to an increase in the market value of equity securities during  and the balance is due to net additions to the stock portfolios ie  new purchases less sales 
as discussed in the preceding insurance operations in run off section of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of continuing operations increased by million year over year 
the net increase was primarily due to the reversal of the fremont reinsurance recoverable and adverse development in citation s property and casualty insurance claims reserves and workers compensation reserves  which more than offset reductions in reserves due to favorable development at physicians and claims payments during at december   on a consolidated basis  available for sale equity securities showed a net unrealized gain of million after tax 
this total consists of approximately million in gains  partially offset by  in losses 
no individual equity security had an unrealized loss  net of tax  of more than  net income pico reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share in  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in  and net income of million  or per diluted share  in the net loss of million  or per share  consisted of a million loss before taxes and minority interest from continuing operations  and the deduction of million in minority interest  which reflects the interest of outside shareholders in the net income of subsidiaries which are less than owned by pico  partially offset by a million income tax benefit  and income from discontinued operations of million after tax 
the million tax benefit for consists of several items  which are detailed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  federal  foreign and state income tax 
the million net income reported in consisted of million net income before a change in accounting principle  or per share  and a change in accounting principle which increased income by million after tax  or per share 
from january   pico adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually rather than amortized over time 
the million in net income recognized reflected the surplus of negative goodwill arising from the reverse merger of physicians and citation insurance group now known as pico holdings  inc over the write off of goodwill items which were determined to be impaired 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle 
the million in net income before a change in accounting principle was comprised of income of million before taxes and minority interest from continuing operations  a million income tax expense  the addition of  in minority interest  and income from discontinued operations of million after tax and a change in accounting principle 
in  pico generated million in net income  consisting of million in net income before a change in accounting principle  or per share  and a change in accounting principle which reduced income by  after tax  or per share 
the change in accounting principle resulted from the adoption of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this non cash charge recognized the accumulated after tax decline in the estimated fair value of warrants we own to buy shares in other companies principally hyperfeed from the date we acquired the warrants through to january  the million in net income before a change in accounting principle was comprised of million in income before taxes and minority interest  a million provision for income tax expense  the addition of  in minority interest  and income from discontinued operations of million after tax 
comprehensive income in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income  pico reports comprehensive income as well as net income from the consolidated statement of operations 
comprehensive income measures changes in shareholders equity  and includes unrealized items which are not recorded in the consolidated statement of operations  for example  foreign currency translation and the change in investment gains and losses on available for sale securities 
over the past three years  pico has recorded comprehensive income of million in  primarily consisting of net increases of million in net unrealized appreciation in investments and  in foreign currency translation  which were partially offset by the million net loss  comprehensive income of million in  primarily consisting of the million net income and movements of million in net unrealized appreciation in investments and million in foreign currency translation  and comprehensive income of million in  consisting of net income of million and a movement of million in net unrealized appreciation in investments  which were partially offset by a  reduction in foreign currency translation

income loss before taxes and minority interest year ended december  vidler water company    nevada land resource company    business acquisitions and financing    insurance operations in run off    hyperfeed technologies  income loss before taxes and minority interest    the principal items in the million loss before taxes and minority interest in were vidler incurred a  loss on million in revenues 
vidler closed on two significant sales of land and related assets in nevada  which generated million in revenues and million in gross margin 
the gross margin on these land sales was more than offset by vidler s on going operating expenses and the costs of developing water assets which will not be monetized until future years  income of million from nevada land on revenues of million  which included million from the sale of land and water rights  an million loss from business acquisitions and financing 
this primarily represented million in gains on the sale of two stocks  which was more than offset by segment expenses  including a million charge from the pico holdings  inc sar program  which replaced the previous option programs  a million loss from insurance operations in run off  consisting of an million profit from physicians and a million loss from citation  and a million loss from the continuing operations of hyperfeed

although vidler began to generate significant revenues from the sale of water rights in  the segment is still incurring costs related to long lived assets which will not generate revenues until future years  eg  operating  maintenance  and amortization expenses at storage facilities which are not yet storing water for customers 
vidler generated total revenues of million in  compared to million in  and million in in  vidler generated million in revenues from the sale of water rights and land 
this primarily represented two transactions  which generated million in revenues the sale of approximately  acres of land and the related water rights near west wendover  nevada 
this transaction added million to revenues and million to gross margin  and the sale of approximately  acres of land and the related water rights at big springs ranch in elko county  nevada 
this transaction added million to revenues and  to gross margin

we do not sell holdings on a regular basis 
a holding may be sold if the price of a security has significantly exceeded our target  or if there have been changes which we believe limit further appreciation potential on a risk adjusted basis 
consequently  the amount of net realized gains or losses recognized during any accounting period has no predictive value 
in addition  in this segment various income items relate to investments held during that period  and since investments change over time  comparability from year to year is limited 
in  a net realized gain of million was recorded 
this primarily represented million in realized gains on the sale of two unrelated foreign stocks 
in addition  as explained in the following paragraphs  a million realized gain on the sale of most of our holding in mc shipping  inc was offset by million in charges for other than temporary impairment of our holdings in accu holding ag and sihl during finally  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities income was  primarily representing an increase in the estimated fair value of hyperfeed warrants 
we regularly review any securities in which we have an unrealized loss 
if we determine that the decline in market value is other than temporary  under gaap we record a charge to reduce the basis of the security from its original cost to current carrying value  which is usually the market price at the balance sheet date when the provision is recorded 
the determination is based on various factors  including the extent and the duration of the unrealized loss 
a charge for other than temporary impairment is a non cash charge  which is recorded as a realized loss 
it should be noted that charges for other than temporary impairments do not affect book value per share  as the after tax decline in the market value of investments carried under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  is already reflected in shareholders equity in our balance sheet  and the carrying book value of the holding does not change 
the impairment simply reclassifies the decline from an unrealized decrease in shareholders equity to a realized loss in the statement of operations 
the written down value becomes our new basis in the investment 
in future accounting periods  unrealized gains or losses from that level will be recorded in shareholders equity  and when the investment is sold a realized gain or loss from that level will be recorded in the statement of operations 
during  we sold the majority of our holding in mc shipping  inc although this resulted in a million realized gain under gaap  the gain only recovered part of a charge for other than temporary impairment of this holding recorded in the gain on mc shipping was offset by charges of million for other than temporary impairment of our holdings in accu holding and sihl  which reflected a decline in the market value of those securities during in  a net realized gain of million was recognized 
this principally consisted of a million gain on the sale of our common shares in aog  which was partially offset by a million charge for other than temporary impairment of our investment in sihl  a million charge for other than temporary impairment of our investment in accu holding  a  charge for other than temporary impairment of our investment in solpower corporation 
in addition  income of  was recorded under sfas no 
 primarily consisting of income of  from aog options  which was partially offset by a  reduction in the estimated fair value of hyperfeed warrants 
in  a million net realized investment loss was recorded 
this consisted of charges of million for other than temporary impairment of our holdings in sihl and solpower  a million loss under sfas no 
reflecting a decrease in the value of warrants during  and a  write off of the remaining carrying value of the loan to mkg enterprises 
in addition  although this did not affect the segment  a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle reduced income by  to reflect the after tax decline in the estimated fair value of warrants during the period from the acquisition of the various warrants through to december  in this segment  investment income includes interest on cash and short term fixed income securities  and dividends from partially owned businesses 
investment income totaled million in  million in  and million in investment income fluctuates depending on the level of cash and temporary investments  the level of interest rates  and the dividends paid by partially owned businesses 
pico s equity share of investees income loss represents our proportionate share of the net income loss and other events affecting equity in the investments which we carry under the equity method  less any dividends received from those investments 
our equity share of investees losses  principally hyperfeed  was  in  million in  and million in segment expenses were million in  million in  and million in the principal expenses recognized in this segment are pico s corporate overhead  the us dollar change in value of a swiss franc inter company loan  and operating expenses from siscom

segment expenses include million related to the pico holdings  inc stock appreciation rights sar program  the accrual of million in incentive compensation  other parent company overhead of million  and million in siscom expenses 
segment expenses were reduced by a million resulting from the effect of appreciation in the swiss franc on an inter company loan during during  the company s shareholders approved the pico holdings  inc sar program  which replaced the stock option and call option programs previously in place 
the change in the in the money amount ie  the difference between the market value of pico stock and the exercise price of the sar of sar outstanding during each accounting period is recorded through the consolidated statements of operations 
an increase in the in the money amount of sar ie  if the price of pico stock rises during the accounting period is recorded as an expense  and a decrease in the in the money amount of sar if the price of pico stock declines will be recorded as a reduction in expenses 
see equity compensation plan information in item  market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
for  a total expense of million before taxes for sar was recorded 
this consists of a million charge on the initial adoption of the sar program on july   and a million expense to record the increase in the in the money amount of sar during the period from july  through the end of our interests in swiss public companies are held by global equity sa  a wholly owned subsidiary which is incorporated in switzerland 
part of global equity sa s funding comes from a loan from pico  which is denominated in swiss francs 
during accounting periods when the swiss franc appreciates relative to the us dollar such as and under gaap we are required to record a benefit through the statement of operations to reflect the fact that global equity sa owes pico more us dollars 
in global equity sa s financial statements  an equivalent debit is included in the foreign currency translation component of shareholders equity since it owes pico more dollars  however  this does not go through the statement of operations 
during accounting periods when the swiss franc depreciates relative to the us dollar  opposite entries are made and an expense is recorded in the statement of operations 
accordingly  we were required to record a benefit of million in our statement of operations in  even though there was no net impact on shareholders equity

however  even when an insurance company is in run off  earned premium can arise 
for example  with swing rated reinsurance  the reinsurance premiums we pay are recalculated based on actual loss experience ie  the number and size of claims 
under gaap  if we are required to pay for additional reinsurance this is recorded as a reduction in the earned premium line  while a reduction in the amount of reinsurance we need to pay is recorded as an increase in earned premiums 
although run off insurance companies no longer write policies  earned premiums can still arise  for example from policies which were still in force when the company went into run off  or related to reinsurance 
our insurance companies have purchased reinsurance from specialized insurance companies to limit our potential losses on the insurance coverage we have provided to our policyholders 
there are various types of reinsurance contracts  including swing rated contracts  where the premium we pay is adjusted retroactively based on the actual loss experience on the block of business which was reinsured 
under gaap  if we need to pay for additional reinsurance this is recorded as a reduction in earned premiums  and if reinsurance premiums are returned to us  this is recorded as an increase in earned premiums 
the financial results of insurance companies in run off can be volatile if there is favorable or unfavorable development in the loss reserves 
physicians recorded significant income from favorable reserve development in and  however  citation recorded a significant loss in  principally due to the reversal of the million fremont reinsurance recoverable and million in reserve increases in the property and casualty insurance and workers compensation loss reserves

on a consolidated basis  the company had million in cash and cash equivalents at december   compared to million at december  in addition to the million in consolidated cash and cash equivalents as defined by gaap  at december   the parent company held fixed income securities  mostly investment grade corporate bonds maturing in  with a market value of million 
our cash flow position fluctuates depending on the requirements of our operating subsidiaries for capital  and activity in our insurance company investment portfolios 
our primary sources of funds include cash balances  cash flow from operations  the sale of holdings  and potentially the proceeds of borrowings or offerings of equity and debt 
we endeavor to ensure that funds are always available to take advantage of new acquisition opportunities 
in broad terms  the cash flow profile of our principal operating subsidiaries is as commercial use of vidler s water assets increases  we expect that vidler will generate free cash flow as receipts from leasing water or storage capacity  and the proceeds from selling land and water rights  begin to overtake maintenance capital expenditure  financing costs  and operating expenses 
as water lease and storage contracts are signed  we anticipate that vidler may be able to monetize some of the contractual revenue streams  which could potentially provide another source of funds  nevada land is actively selling land which has reached its highest and best use  and is not part of pico s long term utilization plan for the property 
nevada land s principal sources of cash flow are the proceeds of cash sales  and collections of principal and interest on sales contracts where nevada land has provided vendor financing 
these receipts and other revenues exceed nevada land s operating costs  so nevada land is generating strong positive cash flow  at this stage of its run off  investment income more than covers citation s operating expenses 
the funds required to pay claims are coming from the sale or maturity of fixed income investments in the citation s investment portfolio  and recoveries from reinsurance companies  as its run off progresses  physicians is obtaining funds to pay operating expenses and claims from the maturity of fixed income securities  the realization of investments  and recoveries from reinsurance companies  and hyperfeed finances its operations from its own cash and cash equivalent balances on a stand alone basis 
at december   hyperfeed held approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
the departments of insurance in ohio and california prescribe minimum levels of capital and surplus for insurance companies  and set guidelines for insurance company investments 
typically  pico s insurance subsidiaries structure the maturity of fixed income securities to match the projected pattern of claims payments 
when interest rates are at very low levels  to insulate the capital value of the bond portfolios against a decline in value which could be brought on by a future increase in interest rates  the bond portfolios may have a shorter duration than the projected pattern of claims payments 
it is possible that fixed income and equity securities may occasionally need to be sold at unfavorable times when the bond market  the stock market  or prices of individual securities are depressed 
as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flow  there was a million net increase in cash and cash equivalents in  compared to a million net increase in  and a million net increase in during  operating activities used cash of  compared to million generated in  and million used in the most significant cash inflows from operating activities were in  approximately million in proceeds of land and related assets sold by nevada land  and million from two significant sales of land and related assets by vidler 
in addition  part of the price of land sold by vidler was satisfied by a million collateralized note  which vidler expects to receive in cash in  in  approximately million in proceeds from water rights and land sold by vidler and million in cash generated by discontinued operations sequoia  and in  million in total receipts from vidler s sale of water rights and land in the harquahala valley irrigation district 
in all three years  the principal uses of cash were operating expenses at vidler and nevada land  claims payments by physicians and citation  and overhead expenses in the business and acquisitions and financing segment 
investing activities generated cash of million in the cash inflow in primarily resulted from cash received of million from the sale of sequoia gross proceeds of approximately million  less the million dividend of common stocks and debt securities received 
the remaining cash flow items principally reflect the net investment of million in fixed income securities and million in marketable equity securities  and the payment of million in cash to acquire additional shares of hyperfeed 
the net investment in fixed income securities represents routine activity in the investment portfolios of our insurance companies  and the temporary investment of surplus funds in fixed income securities 
the investment in marketable equity securities principally represents the net investment of million of common stocks by the insurance companies  and the net investment of million in common stocks by the parent company and global equity sa 
in  investing activities used cash of million 
this primarily represented the sale of our holding in aog for million and the subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds in marketable fixed income and equity securities  and regular activity in the investment portfolios of our insurance companies 
in  investing activities generated cash of million 
the most significant cash inflow was million from the sale of part of our interest in semitropic 
significant cash outflows included the investment of approximately million in sihl and aog common stock 
most of the remaining investing activities cash flow represents activity in the investment portfolios of our insurance companies  and the temporary investment of surplus funds in fixed income securities 
financing activities used  of cash in  primarily due to the repayment of  in non recourse borrowings collateralized by farm properties owned by vidler 
in addition  during global equity sa repaid borrowings to a swiss bank of million chf million and took out new borrowings of an equivalent amount with another swiss bank 
in  financing activities used million of cash  primarily due to the repayment of million in non recourse borrowings collateralized by the farm properties in the harquahala valley irrigation district by vidler  and a net reduction of  in swiss franc borrowings 
financing activities used million of cash in vidler paid off approximately million in non recourse borrowings collateralized by the farm properties in the harquahala valley irrigation district which it sold during the year 
global equity sa took on an additional million of swiss franc denominated borrowings to help finance the acquisition of investments in swiss public companies 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
although we cannot accurately predict the effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on our net revenues or results of operations 
at december   pico had no significant commitments for future capital expenditures 
share repurchase program in october  pico s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of pico common stock 
the stock purchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices through open market or negotiated transactions  depending on market conditions  and will be funded from available cash

regulatory insurance disclosures liabilities for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses liabilities for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated based upon actual and industry experience  and assumptions and projections as to claims frequency  severity and inflationary trends and settlement payments 
such estimates may vary from the eventual outcome 
the inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves is particularly acute for lines of business for which both reported and paid losses develop over an extended period of time 
several years or more may elapse between the occurrence of an insured medical professional liability insurance or casualty loss or workers compensation claim  the reporting of the loss and the final payment of the loss 
loss reserves are estimates of what an insurer expects to pay claimants  legal and investigative costs and claims administrative costs 
pico s insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain reserves for payment of estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported claims and claims which have occurred but have not yet been reported 
ultimate actual liabilities may be materially more or less than current reserve estimates 
reserves for reported claims are established on a case by case basis 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  the regulatory environment  benefit levels  economic conditions  judicial administration of claims  general trends in claim severity and frequency  medical costs and other factors which could affect the adequacy of loss reserves 
management reviews and adjusts incurred but not reported claims reserves regularly 
the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of physicians and citation were million at december   million at december   and million at december  before reinsurance reserves  which reduce net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
of those amounts  the liabilities for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses of prior years increased by million in  and decreased by million in  and million in these changes to prior years reserves were due to the following change in unpaid loss and lae reserves for prior years increase decrease in provision from prior year claims    retroactive insurance   net increase decrease in liabilities for unpaid loss and lae of prior years    see note of notes to pico s consolidated financial statements  reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for additional information regarding reserve changes 
although insurance reserves are certified annually by independent actuaries for each insurance company as required by state law  significant fluctuations in reserve levels can occur based upon a number of variables used in actuarial projections of ultimate incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 
analysis of loss and loss adjustment expense development the following table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for through for all continuing operations property and casualty and workers compensation lines of business and medical professional liability insurance 
the net liability as originally estimated line shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recorded at the balance sheet date on a discounted basis  prior to  for each of the indicated years

for example  the amount of the redundancy related to losses settled in  but incurred in  will be included in the decrease or increase amount for  and conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
for example  physicians commuted reinsurance contracts in several different years that significantly increased the estimate of net reserves for prior years by reducing the recoverable loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for those years 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future increases or decreases based on this table 
the data in the above table is based on schedule p from each of physician s and citation s to annual statements  as filed with state insurance departments  however  the development table above differs from the development displayed in schedule p  part  of the insurance annual statements as schedule p  part  excludes unallocated loss adjustment expenses 
loss reserve experience the inherent uncertainties in estimating loss reserves are greater for some insurance products than for others  and are dependent on the length of the reporting lag or tail associated with a given product ie  the lapse of time between the occurrence of a claim and the report of the claim to the insurer  on the diversity of historical development patterns among various aggregations of claims  the amount of historical information available during the estimation process  the degree of impact that changing regulations and legal precedents may have on open claims  and the consistency of reinsurance programs over time  among other things 
because medical professional liability insurance  commercial casualty and workers compensation claims may not be fully paid for several years or more  estimating reserves for such claims can be more uncertain than estimating reserves in other lines of insurance 
as a result  precise reserve estimates cannot be made for several years following a current accident year for which reserves are initially established 
there can be no assurance that the insurance companies have established reserves adequate to meet the ultimate cost of losses arising from such claims 
it has been necessary  and will over time continue to be necessary  for the insurance companies to review and make appropriate adjustments to reserves for estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses 
to the extent reserves prove to be inadequate  the insurance companies would have to adjust their reserves and incur a charge to income  which could have a material adverse effect on pico s statement of operations and financial condition

workers compensation insurance through citation insurance company claims and liabilities related to the insolvency of fremont indemnity company in  pursuant to a quota share reinsurance agreement the reinsurance agreement  citation ceded its california workers compensation insurance liabilities to citation national insurance company cnic and transferred all administrative services relating to these liabilities to fremont 
the reinsurance agreement became effective upon fremont s acquisition  with approval from the california department of insurance the department  of cnic on or about june  thereafter  on or about december   cnic merged  with department approval  with and into fremont 
accordingly  since january   fremont has been both the reinsurer and the administrator of the california workers compensation business ceded by citation 
during the period from june  the date on which citation ceded its workers compensation insurance liabilities through july  the date on which fremont was placed in liquidation  fremont maintained a workers compensation insurance securities deposit in california for the benefit of claimants under workers compensation insurance policies issued  or assumed  by fremont hereafter  the deposit 
as set forth in part iii of the special california schedule p s filed by fremont during such time period  a portion of the deposit was specifically allocated by fremont for the benefit of citation and claimants under workers compensation insurance policies issued by citation and thereafter assumed and administered by fremont hereafter  the citation allocated deposit 
fremont s special schedule p reflects that it had posted a deposit for the benefit of citation of approximately million subject to a reserve discount adjustment discussed below 
fremont s special schedule p reflects that it had posted a deposit for the benefit of citation of approximately million subject to a reserve discount adjustment discussed below 
the portion of the deposit other than the citation allocated deposit is hereafter referred to as the unallocated deposit 
concurrent with fremont s posting of the citation allocated deposit  citation reduced its own workers compensation insurance reserves by the amount of the citation allocated deposit 
prior to the commencement of fremont s liquidation case  the department had never questioned  let alone disputed  citation s right to reduce its workers compensation insurance reserves by the amount of the citation allocated deposit posted by fremont for citation s benefit 
according to an am best company report dated june   fremont executed a letter of oversight with the department on november   which provided the department with certain oversight privileges in return for allowing fremont to discount its workers compensation loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserves related to and prior accident years 
under a permitted accounting practice  a discount rate of was applied to the loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserves as of june  on december   the department revised the permitted accounting practice to allow fremont to discount its workers compensation loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for accidents occurring in and earlier using a discount rate 
in accordance with the aforementioned permitted accounting practice s  fremont appears to have reduced its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for accidents occurring in and earlier 
in addition  and without explanation or justification  fremont appears to have reduced its special schedule p deposits 
a review of part iii of fremont s special schedule p reveals that fremont had posted total deposits on account of assumed reinsurance of  of which  was for the benefit of citation  and that fremont made a reserve discount adjustment of  and thereby reduced its total part iii special schedule p deposits to  neither fremont nor the department informed citation of fremont s request to reduce the citation allocated deposit  the department s approval of the same if any or fremont s subsequent reduction of the citation allocated deposit 
as a result  citation only recently became aware of the reduction of the citation allocated deposit 
given its prior lack of knowledge  citation did not previously challenge the reduction of the citation allocated deposit or otherwise increase its own deposit 
although the exact impact of the reserve discount adjustment upon citation is unclear  the department of insurance allowed a full reinsurance offset to citation in the amount of the citation allocation deposit for and on june   the superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles the liquidation court entered an order of conservation over fremont and appointed the california department of insurance commissioner the commissioner as the conservator 
pursuant to such order  the commissioner was granted authority to take possession of all of fremont s assets  including its rights in the citation allocated deposit 
shortly thereafter  on july   the liquidation court entered an order appointing the commissioner as the liquidator of fremont s estate hereafter  the liquidator 
the july  order further provides  in relevant part  that i the rights and liabilities of claimants  creditors  shareholders  policyholders  escrow holders and all other persons interested in the assets of 
fremont  including the state of california  are fixed as of the date of the entry of this order  and ii any and all claims against 
fremont 



 including those which in any way affect or seek to affect any of the assets of 
fremont  wherever and however such assets may be owned or held  must be filed by no later than june  the claims bar date 


and any claim not filed by the claims bar date is conclusively deemed forever waived 
under citation s interpretation of the applicable law  the citation allocated deposit assets are required to be i held by the commissioner in trust  separate and apart from fremont s general account and other assets of its estate  and ii applied solely towards the payment of the assumed claims and allocated claims expenses arising from the workers compensation insurance policies that citation ceded transferred to fremont and its predecessor in interest 
accordingly  in the wake of the aforementioned events  in the fourth quarter of  citation requested that the commissioner  in his capacity as the liquidator  i maintain the citation allocated deposit assets separate and apart from other assets of the estate and ii apply the same solely to the payment of the direct and assumed claims and allocated claims expenses arising from the workers compensation insurance liabilities that citation ceded transferred to cnic and fremont 
alternatively  citation requested that the commissioner pay citation s ceded liabilities from the totality of fremont s special schedule p deposit on a pari passu basis with fremont s direct and assumed workers compensation claims and allocated claims expenses 
as of the date hereof  the commissioner has refused to comply with citation s request  instead  the commissioner indicated that he intended to transfer the citation allocated deposit to the california insurance guarantee association ciga 
at present  it is unknown whether the commissioner is still in possession of the citation allocated deposit 
thus  the department appears to have i refused to acknowledge that the citation allocated deposit assets are required to have been held in trust for citation and its policyholders  and ii maintained its belief that citation holds nothing more than a general unsecured claim that falls near the bottom of the statutory distribution scheme 
shortly thereafter  citation concluded that  because fremont had been placed in liquidation  citation was no longer entitled to take a reinsurance credit for the citation allocated deposit under the statutory basis of accounting 
consequently  citation reversed the million reinsurance recoverable from fremont in its june  financial statements prepared on the statutory basis of accounting 
in addition  citation made a corresponding provision for the reinsurance recoverable from fremont at june  for gaap purposes  as disclosed in pico s form q dated june  accordingly  citation has  for both its statutory and gaap financial statements  provided for the reinsurance recoverable from fremont on its workers compensation policy liabilities 
in light of the foregoing  it appears that citation must litigate its claim to the citation allocated deposit assets 
as of the date hereof  citation has not filed a claim seeking the benefit of the citation allocated deposit 
however  unless the situation is amicably resolved  citation intends to bring legal action to enforce its rights prior to the june  claims bar date 
in the event that citation asserts  but fails to prevail on such a claim  it is unlikely to receive any distribution from the fremont estate or any credit for the citation allocated deposit 
if  however  citation prevails on such a claim  it may obtain the benefit  directly or indirectly  of the citation allocated deposit  as well as other relief 
citation feels very strongly in the validity of its claim 
however  the results of litigation are difficult to predict 
moreover  this dispute  involving the interpretation of workers compensation laws enacted in  appears to present an issue of first impression 
accordingly  citation is presently unable to predict the outcome of this dispute with a reasonable degree of certainty reinsurance agreements on workers compensation insurance liabilities in addition to the reinsurance agreements with fremont noted above  citation s workers compensation insurance liabilities from policy years to retain additional reinsurance coverage with general reinsurance  a wholly owned subsidiary of berkshire hathaway  inc standard poors rating of aaa

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pico s balance sheets include a significant amount of assets and liabilities whose fair value are subject to market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market interest rates or prices 
pico currently has interest rate risk as it relates to its fixed maturity securities and mortgage participation interests  equity price risk as it relates to its marketable equity securities  and foreign currency risk as it relates to investments denominated in foreign currencies 
generally  pico s borrowings are short to medium term in nature and therefore approximate fair value 
at december   pico had million of fixed maturity securities and mortgage participation interests  million of marketable equity securities that were subject to market risk  of which million were denominated in foreign currencies  primarily swiss francs 
pico s investment strategy is to manage the duration of the portfolio relative to the duration of the liabilities while managing interest rate risk 
pico uses two models to report the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities subject to the above risks 
for its fixed maturity securities  and mortgage participation interests  pico uses duration modeling to calculate changes in fair value 
for its marketable securities  pico uses a hypothetical decrease in the fair value to analyze the sensitivity of its market risk assets and liabilities 
for investments denominated in foreign currencies  pico uses a hypothetical decrease in the local currency of that investment 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical results assumed in this disclosure due to possible actions taken by management to mitigate adverse changes in fair value and because the fair value of securities may be affected by credit concerns of the issuer  prepayment rates  liquidity  and other general market conditions 
the sensitivity analysis duration model produced a loss in fair value of million for a basis point decline in interest rates on its fixed securities and mortgage participation interests 
the hypothetical decrease in fair value of pico s marketable equity securities produced a loss in fair value of million that would impact the unrealized appreciation in shareholders equity  net of the related tax effect 
the hypothetical decrease in the local currency of pico s foreign denominated investments produced a loss of million that would impact the foreign currency translation in shareholders equity
