item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the company operates two value rental car brands  dollar and thrifty 
the majority of its customers pick up their vehicles at airport locations 
both brands are value priced and the company therefore seeks to be the industry s low cost provider 
leisure customers rent vehicles for longer periods than business customers  on average  providing lower transaction costs 
the company believes its vehicle utilization is consistently higher than that of its competitors 
both dollar and thrifty operate through a network of company owned stores and franchisees 
the majority of the company s revenue is generated from renting vehicles to customers through company owned stores  with lesser amounts generated by fees and leasing revenue from franchisees 
during the early part of  the company s revenues and profits were negatively impacted by weak travel conditions leading up to  during and following the war in iraq 
during the first half of  revenue per day was down about from the prior year and same store rental day volume was up only slightly 
during the third and fourth quarters of travel began to improve as the economy began to strengthen 
year over year pricing trends improved during the third and fourth quarters from that experienced during the first half  with revenue per day down about in the third quarter and up slightly in the fourth quarter compared to same store rental day volume was up in the third quarter and up nearly in the fourth quarter 
airline enplanements  an important driver for airport rental car demand  were down in versus  however enplanements were down only in the fourth quarter 
prior to  the company maintained separate organizations for both the dollar and thrifty brands 
at the beginning of the year  the company implemented a single company structure organized around functions 
the company believes this new structure provides a more efficient operating structure and will facilitate more efficient growth 
the company is working to combine and improve information technology systems to gain efficiencies and facilitate growth 
the company also closed one of its satellite reservation centers as a result of this new structure 
the company is working to transition the thrifty business model from a franchise model to a corporate operating model  similar to dollar s 
the company s long term strategy is to operate both brands as corporate stores in the top us airport markets  the top eight canadian airport markets and in key leisure destinations and to operate through franchisees in the smaller markets 
during the year  the company acquired franchise operations in key us and canadian markets and opened six us greenfield locations 
during  rental day volume increased by over in company owned stores as a result of franchisee acquisitions and the opening of greenfield locations 
the company expects that the majority of the franchises available for sale can be purchased over the next two years and funded with cash from operations 
during  the company also implemented a new operating model for corporate store operations  operating both the dollar and thrifty brands with a single management team  sharing systems  vehicles  back office employees and service facilities  where possible 
the company believes this is a more efficient operating model  which also facilitates the transition of the thrifty brand from a franchise model to a corporate model  as franchise operations continue to be acquired 
the company s profitability is primarily a function of the volume and pricing of rental transactions  utilization of the vehicles and the number of vehicles leased to franchisees 
significant changes in the purchase or disposal price of vehicles or interest rates can also have a significant effect on the company s profitability  depending on the ability of the company to adjust pricing and lease rates for these changes 
the company s business requires significant expenditures for vehicles and consequently  requires substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures 
the company expects its ongoing cash flow to exceed cash required to operate the business 
thus  in july  the company announced a million share repurchase program to be completed over a two year period 
during the third and fourth quarters of the company purchased  shares for million

the company reports taxable income for the us and canada in separate tax jurisdictions and establishes provisions separately for each jurisdiction 
on a separate  domestic basis  the us effective tax rate approximates the statutory tax rate including the effect of state income taxes 
however  on a consolidated basis  no income tax benefit is recorded for canadian losses in  thus  increasing the consolidated effective tax rate 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  airline traffic continued to decline in from the already depressed levels of dollar  consistent with the rental car industry  responded by reducing fleet capacity to match lower levels of demand

expenses increase increase decrease decrease in millions direct vehicle and operating vehicle depreciation and lease charges  net selling  general and administrative interest expense  net of interest income amortization of goodwill total expenses direct vehicle and operating expenses for increased million 
the increase was due to higher costs associated with operating additional corporate stores  costs associated with higher depreciable fleet and transaction levels and higher insurance costs 
during  the company experienced significant increases in quoted market premiums for renewal of its third party insurance coverage resulting from general insurance industry trends 
the company determined it to be more cost effective to increase its retention of risk of loss for public liability and property damage claims in various amounts up to million per occurrence 
this resulted in an increase in self insurance costs of million 
in addition  insurance premiums correspondingly decreased by million due to the company no longer acquiring third party insurance coverage on claims up to million per occurrence 
the company will continue to evaluate the cost of insurance against retained risk when renewing its various insurance coverages 
bad debt expenses were lower by million in versus due to improved financial performance of franchisees as a result of improved industry pricing in and the negative impact of the terrorist attacks on the collectibility of franchisee receivables in  resulting in higher bad debt expense

the increased costs discussed above were offset by overall reductions in various selling  general and administrative expense categories that individually were not significant totaling million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenue for  compared to of revenue for net interest expense increased million in primarily due to higher average vehicle debt  partially offset by lower interest rates 
net interest expense was of revenue for  compared to of revenue for the tax provision for was million 
the effective tax rate of for was lower than the in the decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the change in the relationship between permanent differences  including goodwill amortization  and us pretax earnings in relationship to canadian pretax results 
the effective tax rate for differs from the us statutory tax rate due primarily to state and local taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary uses of liquidity are for the purchase of vehicles for its rental and leasing fleets  non vehicle capital expenditures  franchisee acquisitions and for working capital 
the company also uses letters of credit or insurance bonds to secure certain commitments related to airport concession agreements  insurance programs  and for other purposes 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  secured vehicle financing  the revolving credit facility and insurance bonds 
cash generated by operating activities of million for is primarily the result of net income  adjusted for depreciation  favorable tax programs discussed below  which provided the company tax refunds in as well as deferral of tax payments on earnings to future years and the reduction in outstanding receivables resulting largely from the shift away from financing leases for vehicles 
the liquidity necessary for purchasing vehicles is primarily obtained from secured vehicle financing  most of which is asset backed notes  sales proceeds from disposal of used vehicles and cash generated by operating activities 
the asset backed notes require varying levels of credit enhancement or overcollateralization  which are provided by a combination of cash  vehicles and letters of credit 
these letters of credit are provided under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company believes that its cash generated from operations  availability under its revolving credit facility  insurance bonding programs and secured vehicle financing programs are adequate to meet its liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
a portion of the secured vehicle financing is supported by day bank facilities  which are renewable annually 
the renewals of the revolving credit facility and the day bank facilities are scheduled to close on april  a significant portion of the secured vehicle financing consists of asset backed notes  which have varying maturities through the company generally issues additional notes each year to replace maturing notes and provide for growth in its fleet 
the company believes the asset backed note market continues to be a viable source of vehicle financing and expects to issue additional notes during  partially to replace maturing notes of million 
the company has experienced increases during the last few years in the level of credit enhancement or additional collateral required for new asset backed notes  the conduit facility and the commercial paper program 
these increased requirements have reduced liquidity available for other corporate purposes 
the company believes it has sufficient resources to meet these requirements 
cash used in investing activities was million 
the principal use of cash in investing activities was the purchase of revenue earning vehicles  which totaled billion  which was partially offset by billion in proceeds from the sale of used revenue earning vehicles 
the company s need for cash to finance vehicles is seasonal and typically peaks in the second and third quarters of the year when fleet levels build to meet seasonal rental demand 
fleet levels are the lowest in the first and fourth quarters when rental demand is at a seasonal low 
restricted cash increased million due to a more significant seasonal decline in the fleet and to increases in cash credit enhancement for asset backed debt compared to the prior year 
the company expects to continue to fund its revenue earning vehicles with cash provided from operations and increased secured vehicle financing 
the company also used cash for non vehicle capital expenditures of million 
these expenditures consist primarily of airport facility improvements for the company s rental locations and investments in information technology equipment and systems 
the company estimates non vehicle capital expenditures to be approximately million in in addition  the company used cash for franchisee acquisitions of million in and will continue to pursue the acquisition of certain franchisee operations  subject to revolving credit facility restrictions 
the company evaluates franchise operations which it is interested in operating corporately 
these operations generally relate to locations in the largest airports and other key locations in the us and canada or locations where the company already operates one of its brands corporately and it believes synergies could be achieved by having both brands represented 
future franchisee acquisition expenditures are expected to be financed with available cash and cash to be provided from future operations 
cash received in financing activities was million primarily due to the issuance of million in asset backed notes in march  an increase of million under the asset backed variable funding note purchase facility the conduit facility and an increase in the net issuance of commercial paper totaling approximately million  partially reduced by the maturity of asset backed notes totaling million

also  during and  the company utilized a like kind exchange program for its vehicles whereby tax basis gains on disposal of eligible revenue earning vehicles are deferred the like kind exchange program 
to qualify for like kind exchange program treatment  the company exchanges through a qualified intermediary vehicles being disposed of with vehicles being purchased allowing the company to carry over the tax basis of vehicles sold to replacement vehicles  with certain adjustments 
the company estimates the acts will eliminate the payment of most cash income taxes through and has allowed it to carry back these benefits to obtain refunds of taxes paid in prior years  of which approximately million was received in no additional material tax refunds are anticipated 
the acts improve the company s liquidity position by increasing cash and cash equivalents due to significantly reduced cash required for tax payments and from refunds of taxes paid in prior years 
the company estimates the like kind exchange program will extend the period in which it will pay reduced cash income taxes beyond  when the bonus depreciation provision included in the acts expire 
the like kind exchange program will also significantly increase the amount of cash and investments restricted for the purchase of replacement vehicles  especially during seasonally reduced fleet periods 
during seasonally low fleet periods  the company will carry higher restricted cash balances and maintain higher debt as compared to periods prior to utilizing the like kind exchange program 
at december   restricted cash and investments totaled million  increasing million for the year ended december  restricted cash and investments are restricted for the acquisition of revenue earning vehicles and other specified uses as defined under the asset backed note program  the canadian fleet securitization partnership program and the like kind exchange program

in march  the company completed an amendment of the revolving credit facility affecting a financial covenant  which also included limiting expenditures for non vehicle capital assets and franchisee acquisitions if certain covenant levels are not maintained 
in july  the company completed another amendment of the revolving credit facility  which among other provisions  allowed the company to retain the higher limitation for franchisee acquisitions during at december   the company had letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility of approximately million and no working capital borrowings 
the company has increased the use of letters of credit to support insurance programs  interest rate swaps and asset backed vehicle financing programs 
in early  the company received bank consent which further reduces restrictions relating to franchisee acquisitions in the revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company is in compliance with all covenants 
the revolving credit facility matures in august   however  the company expects this facility to be renewed and extended during debt servicing requirements the company will continue to have substantial debt and debt service requirements under its financing arrangements 
as of december   the company s total consolidated debt and other obligations were approximately billion  all of which was secured debt for the purchase of vehicles 
the majority of the company s vehicle debt is issued by special purpose finance entities as described herein all of which are fully consolidated into the company s financial statements 
the company has scheduled annual principal payments of approximately billion in  million in  million in and million in the company intends to use cash generated from operations and from the sale of vehicles for debt service and  subject to restrictions under its debt instruments  to make capital investments 
the company has historically repaid its debt and funded its capital investments aside from growth in its rental fleet with cash provided from operations and from the sale of vehicles 
the company has funded growth in its vehicle fleet by incurring additional secured vehicle debt and with cash generated from operations 
the company expects to incur additional debt from time to time to the extent permitted under the terms of its debt instruments 
the company has significant requirements for bonds and letters of credit to support its insurance programs and airport concession obligations 
at december   various insurance companies had issued million in bonds and various banks had issued million in letters of credit to secure these obligations 
interest rate risk the company s results of operations depend significantly on prevailing levels of interest rates because of the large amount of debt it incurs to purchase vehicles 
in addition  the company is exposed to increases in interest rates because a portion of its debt bears interest at floating rates 
the company estimates that  in  approximately of its average debt will bear interest at floating rates 
the amount of the company s financing costs affects the amount the company must charge its customers to be profitable 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation the increased acquisition cost of vehicles is the primary inflationary factor affecting the company 
many of the company s other operating expenses are also expected to increase with inflation 
management does not expect that the effect of inflation on the company s overall operating costs will be greater for the company than for its competitors 
critical accounting policies and estimates as with most companies  the company must exercise judgment in estimating certain costs included in its results of operations 
the more significant items include public liability and property damage the company may self insure or retain a portion of the exposure for losses related to public liability and property damage insurance 
the obligation for public liability and property damage represents an estimate of both reported accident claims not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported  up to the company s risk retention level 
the company records public liability and property damage expense on a monthly basis based on rental volume in relation to historical accident claim experience and trends  projections of ultimate losses  expenses  premiums and administrative costs 
management monitors the adequacy of the liability and monthly accrual rates based on the services of an independent third party actuary and internal analysis of the development of the claim reserves  the accident claim history and rental volume 
since the ultimate disposition of the claims is uncertain  the likelihood of materially different results is possible  but the potential volatility of these estimates is reduced due to the frequency of internal reviews and reviews by the third party actuary and significant historical data available for similar claims 
vehicle depreciation expense the company generally purchases to of its vehicles as program vehicles for which residual values are determined by depreciation rates that are established and guaranteed by the manufacturers 
the remaining to of the company s vehicles are purchased without the benefit of a manufacturer residual value guaranty program 
for these non program vehicles  the company must estimate what the residual values of these vehicles will be at the expected time of disposal to determine monthly depreciation rates by reviewing the projected market value for the vehicles at expected date of disposition and the overall outlook for the used car market 
the company continually evaluates estimated residual values 
differences between actual residual values and those estimated by the company result in a gain or loss on disposal and are recorded as an adjustment to depreciation expense 
the average life of the non program vehicles is seven to nine months and the company has generally experienced gains on disposal 
however  recent declines in used car market prices have resulted in a corresponding decline in these gains or increase in losses  as experienced in late and continuing throughout much of many factors affect the market value of used cars including increasing use of incentives and zero percent financing by automobile manufacturers for new vehicles and overall economic conditions 
the likelihood that the company s estimates could materially change is possible due to the volatility of the used car market 
a three percent change in the expected residual value of non program vehicles sold during would have impacted vehicle depreciation expense  net by million 
bad debt expense the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and charges bad debt expense for estimated losses resulting from the inability of franchisees to make required payments 
management reviews monthly the individual accounts of franchisees with past due balances to determine the likelihood of collectibility and the amount of bad debt expense  if any  required for a particular franchisee 
factors considered include the aging and magnitude of past due amounts  the franchisees operating and credit history  market conditions  operating plan and available collateral 
the company records a reserve for the potential amounts owed by its franchisees that will not be collected when the amount of the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
accounts are typically charged off at the point the company reaches settlement or no longer pursues collection 
the likelihood that results may materially differ from amounts estimated is possible due to circumstances outside the franchisees or the company s control with respect to economic  industry or other external conditions 
in addition  as the company continues to acquire franchisees in larger markets  the corresponding receivables and risk of collectibility from franchisees will continue to decline 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement supersedes eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity

the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early adoption permitted 
since the company formally communicated the reorganization plans in december  the company applied the provisions of eitf no

this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee

fin r requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities vie s to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss  if any  from the vie s activities  or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
the company believes that its involvement with thrifty national ad qualifies thrifty national ad as a vie with the company representing the primary beneficiary 
consequently  thrifty national ad will be initially consolidated in the company s financial statements beginning with the quarter ending march  thrifty national ad is a separate entity organized for the purpose of conducting the advertising and promotion programs for the thrifty car rental brand as directed by the thrifty car rental franchisee network and representatives of the company 
the total assets of thrifty national ad were approximately million as of december  and its net income was approximately million for the year then ended 
the company s estimated maximum exposure to loss as a result of its continuing involvement with thrifty national ad is expected to be minimal as expenditures are managed by thrifty national ad based on revenues 
the company also evaluated its franchisee network as potential vie s subject to possible consolidation 
the company determined that its franchisees met the fin r definition of a business  however  the company did not provide more than half of each franchisees equity  among other qualifying conditions 
therefore  the company believes that its franchisees do not qualify as vie s under fin r and are not required to be consolidated into the company s financial statements

the new operating model and organizational structure will provide increased efficiencies 
the company will make additional investment in improved it systems  marketing initiatives and infrastructure to facilitate additional growth 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about the company s market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
the company s primary market risk exposure is changing interest rates  primarily in the united states 
the company manages interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swap agreements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
all items described are non trading and are stated in us dollars 
because a portion of the company s debt is denominated in canadian dollars  its carrying value is impacted by exchange rate fluctuations 
however  this foreign currency risk is mitigated by the underlying collateral which is the canadian fleet 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps is calculated using projected market interest rates over the term of the related debt instruments as provided by the counter parties 
expected maturity dates as of december  total fair value december  in thousands debt vehicle debt and obligations floating rates weighted average interest rates vehicle debt and obligations fixed rates weighted average interest rates vehicle debt and obligations canadian dollar denominated weighted average interest rates interest rate swaps variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate floating rate vehicle debt and obligations include the million series notes  million relating to the series notes and the million series notes swapped from floating interest rates to fixed interest rates

interest rate sensitivity based on the company s level of floating rate debt  excluding notes with floating interest rates swapped to fixed interest rates and canadian floating rate vehicle debt  at december   a basis point fluctuation in interest rates would have an approximate million impact on the company s expected pretax income 
in  the company has higher floating rate debt due to a change in the composition of floating rate and fixed rate debt  thus  impacting the company s sensitivity to floating rate debt
