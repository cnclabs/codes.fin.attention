item business general harvest natural resources  inc is an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  development  production and disposition of oil and gas properties since  when it was incorporated under delaware law 
over our history  we have acquired and developed significant interests in the bolivarian republic of venezuela venezuela and the russian federation russia and have undeveloped acreage offshore china 
our producing operations are conducted principally through our percent owned venezuelan subsidiary  benton vinccler  ca benton vinccler  which operates the south monagas unit in venezuela 
from december  through february   no sales of our venezuelan oil production were made because of petroleos de venezuela  sa s pdvsa inability to accept our oil due to the national civil work stoppage in venezuela 
while restoring production led to increased workover activity and higher operating costs  the return performance of the field was within our expectations 
on november   we diversified our revenue stream by beginning the sale of natural gas in venezuela 
on september   we closed the sale and purchase agreement to sell our entire percent minority equity investment in llc geoilbent geoilbent  to yukos operational holding limited  a russian oil and gas company  for million plus million as repayment of intercompany loans and outstanding accounts payable owed to us by geoilbent 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations for a complete description of these and other events

business strategy our business strategy is to identify  acquire  develop and produce large discovered oil and gas fields in areas that are being largely avoided by many other oil and gas companies due to challenging political and economic circumstances 
we have more than ten years of experience in venezuela and russia  and have established operating organizations in both countries 
we seek additional opportunities in these two countries and in other countries that meet our investment criteria 
in executing our business strategy  we will strive to sustain the current balance sheet strength through financial prudence and rigorous investment profitability criteria  maximize cash flows from existing operations to invest in new opportunities  use our experience  skills and cash on hand to acquire new projects in russia and venezuela  and keep our organizational capabilities in line with our rate of growth 
in venezuela  we intend to deliver more operating cash flow through the efficient management of our capital expenditure programs and cost structure 
we completed the first phase of our gas project at the south monagas unit in november on time and within budget and commenced gas sales on november  this is an important milestone of our strategy because it diversifies our revenues and cash flow  and develops vital market outlets to support further development of untapped reserves of natural gas in eastern venezuela 
our venezuelan producing properties generate net cash from operating activities in excess of projected capital expenditures 
we expect to reinvest this cash in new growth opportunities in venezuela 
in november  we executed a memorandum of understanding with pdvsa to submit a plan of development for the previously developed temblador field and the discovered  yet undeveloped  el salto field 
under the terms of the memorandum of understanding  we can submit a plan of development for development of the fields under venezuela s organic hydrocarbon law 
we are also in discussions with pdvsa for the development of the nearby isleno field 
we are seeking to diversify our cash flow outside of venezuela as events there demonstrated the risks of our concentration in venezuela when we lost six weeks of production in the first part of we seek operational and financial control  good minority interest partners  access to competitive oil and gas markets  and where possible  reliable export facilities and infrastructure 
we seek low entry cost projects that need additional funding  execution skills and well reasoned development 
in russia  we continue to evaluate a number of options to invest in known discoveries which remain undeveloped or under developed 
in september  we sold our percent minority equity investment in our russian company geoilbent 
as a minority interest owner  our continuing investment in geoilbent was determined to be inconsistent with our objective of investing in properties in which we have operating and financial control 
we intend to continue to identify  acquire and exploit known oil and natural gas fields in our current areas of activity while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility 
to accomplish this  we intend to 
table of contents focus our efforts in areas of low geologic risk 
we intend to focus our activities principally in areas of large known but undeveloped or under developed oil and gas resources 
seek operational and financial control 
we desire to control all major decisions for development  production  staffing and financing of each project for a period of time sufficient for us to reap attractive returns on investments 
establish a local presence through joint venture partners and the use of local personnel we seek to establish a local presence in our areas of operation to facilitate stronger relationships with local government and labor 
in addition  using local personnel helps us to take advantage of local knowledge and experience and to minimize costs 
in pursuing new opportunities  we will seek to enter at an early stage and find local partners in an effort to reduce our risk in any one venture 
commit capital in a phased manner to limit total commitments at any one time we are willing to agree to minimum capital expenditure or development commitments at the outset of new projects  but we endeavor to structure such commitments so that we can fulfill them over time under a prudent plan of development  allowing near term operating cash flow to help fund further investment  thereby limiting our maximum cash outlay 
we also seek to maximize available local financing capacity to develop the hydrocarbons and associated infrastructure 
limit exploration activities we do not engage in exploration except in connection with the expansion of an existing reservoir and in that case only where the risks are deemed to be manageable in the context of total cash exposure and probability of success 
maintain a prudent financial plan we intend to maintain our financial flexibility by maintaining our total debt within average industry debt to capitalization levels  closely monitoring spending  holding significant cash reserves  actively seeking opportunities to reduce our weighted average cost of capital and increasing our liquidity 
our ability to successfully execute our strategy is subject to significant risks including  among other things  operating risks  political risks  legal risks and financial risks 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations and other information set forth elsewhere in this form k for a description of these and other risk factors 
operations the following table summarizes our proved reserves  drilling and production activity  and financial operating data by principal geographic area at the end of each of the years ending december   and all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and pdvsa under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
we disposed of our russian investments partly in and partly in geoilbent and arctic gas were accounted for under the equity method and were included at their respective ownership interests in our consolidated financial statements for the periods in which we owned such investments 
our year end financial information contains results from our russian operations based on a twelve month period ending september accordingly  our results of operations for the years ended december   and reflect results from geoilbent until it was sold on september   and for the twelve months ended september  and  and from arctic gas  until it was sold on april  and for the twelve months ended september  we own percent of benton vinccler 
the reserve information presented below is net of a percent deduction for the minority interest in benton vinccler 
drilling and production activity and financial data are reflected without deduction for minority interest 
reserves include production projected through the end of the operating service agreement in we have submitted a request for extension under the force majeure provisions of our contract 
the venezuelan national civil work stoppage required benton vinccler to shut in production for approximately two months 
we believe the two months representing this delay will be added to the original term of our agreement

these fields comprise the south monagas unit 
we were the first us company since to be granted such an oil field development contract in venezuela 
the oil and natural gas operations in the south monagas unit are conducted by benton vinccler  our percent owned subsidiary 
the remaining percent of the outstanding capital stock of benton vinccler is owned by vinccler 
through our majority ownership of stock in benton vinccler  we make all operational and corporate decisions related to benton vinccler  subject to certain super majority provisions of benton vinccler s charter documents related to mergers  consolidations  sales of substantially all of its corporate assets  change of business  and similar major corporate events 
vinccler has an extensive operating history in venezuela 
it provided benton vinccler with initial financial assistance and significant construction services 
vinccler provided assistance with construction projects  governmental relations and labor relations during under the terms of the operating service agreement  benton vinccler is a contractor for pdvsa 
benton vinccler is responsible for overall operations of the south monagas unit  including all necessary investments to reactivate and develop the fields comprising the south monagas unit 
the venezuelan government maintains full 
table of contents ownership of all hydrocarbons in the fields 
in addition  pdvsa maintains full ownership of equipment and capital infrastructure following its installation 
the operating service agreement provides for benton vinccler to receive an operating fee for each barrel of crude oil delivered 
it also provides benton vinccler with the right to receive a capital recovery fee for certain of its capital expenditures  provided that such operating fee and capital recovery fee cannot exceed the maximum total fee per barrel set forth in the agreement 
the operating fee is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the special energy index of the us consumer price index 
the maximum total fee is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the average of certain world crude oil prices 
since  the maximum total fee received by benton vinccler has approximated percent of west texas intermediate crude oil wti price 
in september  benton vinccler and pdvsa signed an amendment to the operating service agreement  providing for the delivery of up to bcf of natural gas through july at a price of per mcf 
natural gas sales began in november and were averaging mmcf per day by the end of the year 
in addition  benton vinccler agreed to sell to pdvsa million barrels of oil stipulated as additional volumes resulting from the gas production incremental crude oil 
incremental crude oil is sold at a price of per barrel with the quarterly volume of such sales based on quarterly natural gas sales multiplied by the ratio of mmbls to bcf 
at the end of each quarter  benton vinccler prepares an invoice to pdvsa based on barrels of oil accepted by pdvsa during the quarter  using quarterly adjusted contract service fees per barrel 
at the end of each quarter  benton vinccler also prepares invoices for natural gas sales and incremental crude oil 
payment is due under the invoices by the end of the second month after the end of the quarter 
invoice amounts and payments are denominated in us dollars 
payments are wire transferred into benton vinccler s account in a commercial bank in the united states 
benton vinccler has constructed a mile oil pipeline from its oil processing facilities at uracoa to pdvsa s storage facility  the custody transfer point 
the operating service agreement specifies that the oil stream may contain no more than one percent base sediment and one percent water 
quality measurements are conducted both at benton vinccler s facilities and at pdvsa s storage facility 
with respect to gas sales  an initial capital investment of approximately million was required to build a mile pipeline with a normal capacity of mmcf of natural gas per day and a design capacity of mmcf of natural gas per day  a gas gathering system  upgrades to the um plant facilities and new gas treatment and compression facilities 
we completed the fabrication and construction process for the gas pipeline in late benton vinccler borrowed million under a project loan for the gas pipeline and related facilities and the remainder was funded from existing cash balances and internally generated cash flow 
in addition  benton vinccler has entered into long term agreements for the leasing of compression  and the operation and maintenance of the gas treatment and compression facilities 
the operating services agreement contains requirements for the measurement and quality of the natural gas delivered to pdvsa 
in august  benton vinccler sold its power generation facility located in the uracoa and tucupita fields 
concurrently with the sale  benton vinccler entered into a long term power purchase agreement with the purchaser of the facility to provide for the electrical needs of the field throughout the remaining term of the operating service agreement 
location and geology the south monagas unit extends across the southeastern part of the state of monagas and the southwestern part of the state of delta amacuro in eastern venezuela 
the south monagas unit is approximately miles long and eight miles wide and consists of  acres  of which the fields comprise approximately one half of the acreage 
at december   proved reserves attributable to our venezuelan operations were  mboe  mboe net to harvest 
this represented percent of our proved reserves at year end 
benton vinccler has been primarily developing the oficina sands in the uracoa field 
the uracoa field contains percent of the south monagas unit s proved reserves 

table of contents drilling and development activity benton vinccler drilled three oil wells and converted two gas injection wells to producing wells in and had an average of wells on production in all fields in uracoa field benton vinccler has been developing the south monagas unit since  beginning with the uracoa field 
benton vinccler processes the oil  water and natural gas in the uracoa central processing unit and ships the processed oil via pipeline to the pdvsa custody transfer point 
benton vinccler treats and filters produced water  then reinjects it into the aquifer to assist the natural water drive 
benton vinccler had reinjected produced natural gas into the natural gas cap primarily for storage conservation until november  at which time it began selling the natural gas 
the major components of the state of the art process facility were designed in the united states and installed by benton vinccler 
this process design is commonly used in heavy oil production in the united states  but was not previously used extensively in venezuela to process crude oil of similar gravity or quality 
the current production facility has capacity to handle mbbls of oil per day  mbbls of water per day and injection capacity of mmcf of natural gas per day 
presently all gas being sold is produced from the uracoa field 
tucupita field there are currently oil producing wells and six water injection wells at tucupita 
the current production facility has capacity to handle mbbls of oil per day  mbbls of water per day and storage for up to mbbls of crude oil 
the oil is transported through a mile  mbbl per day capacity oil pipeline constructed in from tucupita to the uracoa central processing unit 
benton vinccler reinjects produced water from tucupita into the aquifer to aid the natural water drive  and we utilize a portion of the associated natural gas to operate a power generation facility to supply our power needs 
bombal field in  benton vinccler drilled three wells in the west bombal field 
portable separation  pumping and storage for mbbl of crude oil are maintained at the field 
the crude oil is pumped via a pipeline and tied into the mile tucupita oil pipeline to the uracoa central processing unit 
the east bombal field was drilled in  and the wells were suspended until gas sales could take place 
benton vinccler expects to begin engineering and design studies in late with first gas sales expected in gas from this field will be used to supplement gas production from uracoa as production there declines 
customers and market information under the operating service agreement  all oil and natural gas produced is delivered to pdvsa for a fee 
from december  through february   no sales were made because of pdvsa s inability to accept our oil due to the national civil work stoppage in venezuela 
while we have substantial cash reserves  a prolonged loss of sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
employees and community relations benton vinccler has a highly skilled staff of local employees and four expatriates and has also formed successful and supportive relationships with local government agencies and communities 
benton vinccler has invested in a social community program that includes medical programs in ophthalmologic and dental care  as well as additional social investments including the purchase of medicines and medical equipment for local communities within the south monagas unit 
health  safety and environment benton vinccler s health  safety and environmental policy is an integral part of its business 
benton vinccler continually improves its policy and practices related to personnel safety  property protection and 
table of contents environmental management 
these improvements can be directly attributed to its efforts in accident prevention programs and the training and implementation of a comprehensive process safety management system

wab  south china sea benton offshore china company general in december  we acquired crestone energy corporation  subsequently renamed benton offshore china company 
its principal asset is a petroleum contract with china national offshore oil corporation cnooc for the wab area 
the wab petroleum contract covers million acres in the south china sea  with an option for an additional million acres under certain circumstances  and lies within an area which is the subject of a territorial dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with another company 
the territorial dispute has lasted for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the area under dispute 
as part of a review of our assets  a third party conducted an evaluation of the wab area 
through that evaluation and our own assessment  we recorded a million impairment charge in the second quarter of an evaluation was performed again at december   and such evaluation indicated that no further impairment of the property had been incurred in location and geology the wab contract area is located approximately miles southeast of the dai hung big bear oil field 
the block is adjacent to british petroleum s giant natural gas discovery at lan tay red orchid and miles north of exxon s natuna discovery 
the contract area covers several similar structural trends  each with potential for hydrocarbon reserves in possible multiple pay zones 
drilling and development activity due to the sovereignty issues between china and vietnam  we have been unable to pursue an exploration program during phase one of the contract 
as a result  we have obtained license extensions  with the current extension in effect until may  domestic operations we acquired a percent interest in three california state offshore oil and gas leases the california leases and a parcel of onshore property from molino energy company  llc 
all capitalized costs associated with the california leases have been fully impaired 
the california leases have expired and we have listed the onshore property for sale 
activities by area the following table summarizes our consolidated activities by area 
total assets represents all assets  including long lived assets accounted for under the equity method 
table of contents other total in thousands venezuela foreign foreign united states total year ended december  oil and gas sales total assets year ended december  oil sales total assets year ended december  oil sales total assets reserves estimates of our proved reserves as of december  and were prepared by ryder scott company  lp  independent petroleum engineers 
the following table sets forth information regarding estimates of proved reserves at december  the venezuelan information includes reserve information net of a percent deduction for the minority interest in benton vinccler 
all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and pdvsa under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
net crude oil and condensate mbbls proved proved developed undeveloped total venezuela net natural gas mmcf proved proved developed undeveloped total venezuela estimates of commercially recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of the future net cash flows derived therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the subject properties  comparison with other producing properties  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  municipal taxes  abandonment costs  development costs  and workover and remedial costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
all such estimates are to some degree speculative and various classifications of reserves are only attempts to define the degree of speculation involved 
for these reasons  estimates of the commercially recoverable reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular property or group of properties  the classification  cost and risk of recovering such reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom  prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially 
the difficulty of making precise estimates is accentuated by the fact that percent of our total proved reserves were undeveloped as of december  the cost to develop the proved undeveloped reserves is expected to be million over the next three years 
reserve estimates are not constrained by the availability of the capital resources required to finance the estimated development and operating expenditures 
in addition  actual future net cash flows will be affected by factors such as 
table of contents actual production  oil and natural gas sales  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  availability and capacity of gathering systems and pipelines  changes in governmental regulations or taxation  and the impact of inflation on costs 
the timing of actual future net oil and natural gas sales from proved reserves as well as the year end price  and thus their actual present value  can be affected by the timing of the incurrence of expenditures in connection with development of oil and gas properties 
the percent discount factor required by the sec to be used to calculate present value for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time  risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry and the political risks associated with operations in venezuela 
discounted present value  regardless of what discount rate is used  is materially affected by assumptions as to the amount and timing of future production  which assumptions may and often do prove to be inaccurate 
for the period ending december   we reported million of discounted future net cash flows before income taxes from proved reserves based on the sec s required calculations 
production  prices and lifting cost summary in the following table we have set forth by country our net production  average sales prices and average operating expenses for the years ended december   and the presentation for venezuela includes percent of the production  without deduction for minority interest 
geoilbent percent ownership and arctic gas percent ownership not subject to any sale or transfer restrictions at december  which are accounted for under the equity method  have been included at their respective ownership interest in the consolidated financial statements based on a fiscal period ending september and  accordingly  our results of operations for the years ended december   and reflect results from geoilbent until it was sold on september   and for the twelve months ended september  and and from arctic gas until it was sold on april  and for the twelve months ended september  year ended december  venezuela crude oil production bbls natural gas production mmcf average crude oil sales price per bbl average natural gas sales price per mmcf average operating expenses per boe russia geoilbent a b net crude oil production bbls average crude oil sales price per bbl average operating expenses per bbl arctic gas a c net crude oil production bbls c c  average crude oil sales price per bbl c c average operating expenses per bbl c c a information represents our ownership interest 
b geoilbent was sold on september  c arctic gas was sold on april  
table of contents regulation general our operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate 
in particular  oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by change in governments  civil unrest  price and currency controls  limitations on oil and natural gas production  world demand for crude oil  tax  environmental  safety and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  changes in such laws  and changes in administrative regulations and the interpretation and application of such rules and regulations 
in any country in which we may do business  the oil and natural gas industry legislation and agency regulation are periodically changed for a variety of political  economic  environmental and other reasons 
numerous governmental departments and agencies issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry  some of which carry substantial penalties for the failure to comply 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business 
venezuela on february   venezuela imposed currency controls and created the commission for administration of foreign currency with the task of establishing the detailed rules and regulations and generally administering the exchange control regime 
these controls fix the exchange rate between the venezuelan bolivar and the us dollar and restrict the ability to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and vice versa 
initially the exchange rate was set at  venezuelan bolivars for each us dollar 
on february   the official exchange rate was adjusted to  venezuelan bolivars for each us dollar 
oil companies such as benton vinccler are allowed to receive payments for oil sales in us dollars and pay us dollar denominated debt  dividends and expenses from those payments 
we do not expect the currency conversion restrictions or the adjustment in the exchange rate to have a material impact on us at this time 
venezuela requires environmental and other permits for certain operations conducted in oil field development  such as site construction  drilling and seismic activities 
as a contractor to pdvsa  benton vinccler submits capital budgets to pdvsa for approval including capital expenditures to comply with venezuelan environmental regulations 
no capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations were required in or benton vinccler also submits requests for permits for drilling  seismic and operating activities to pdvsa  which then obtains such permits from the ministry of energy and mines and ministry of environment  as required 
benton vinccler is also subject to income  municipal and value added taxes  and must file certain monthly and annual compliance reports with the national tax administration and with various municipalities 
drilling and undeveloped acreage for acquisitions of leases and producing properties  development and exploratory drilling  production facilities and additional development activities such as workovers and recompletions  we spent approximately excluding our share of capital expenditures incurred by equity affiliates million  million and million in  and  respectively 
included in these numbers is million  million and million for the development of proved undeveloped reserves in  and  respectively

we do not directly operate any drilling equipment 
acreage the following table summarizes the developed and undeveloped acreage that we owned  leased or held under operating service agreement or concession as of december  developed undeveloped gross net gross net venezuela china total competition we encounter strong competition from major oil and gas companies and independent operators in acquiring properties and leases for the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas 
the principal competitive factors in the acquisition of such oil and gas properties include staff and data necessary to identify  investigate and purchase such properties  and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such properties 
many of our competitors have financial resources  staffs  data resources and facilities substantially greater than ours 
environmental regulation various federal  state  local and international laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  may affect our operations and costs 
we are committed to the protection of the environment and believe we are in substantial compliance with the applicable laws and regulations 
however  regulatory requirements may  and often do  change and become more stringent  and there can be no assurance that future regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
employees at december   we had full time employees  augmented from time to time with independent consultants  as required 
benton vinccler had employees and our moscow office had employees 
title to developed and undeveloped acreage all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and pdvsa  under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 

table of contents the wab petroleum contract lies within an area which is the subject of a territorial dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with a third party 
the territorial dispute has existed for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the area under dispute 
it is uncertain when or how this dispute will be resolved  and under what terms the various countries and parties to the agreements may participate in the resolution 
item properties in july  we leased office space in houston  texas for three years for approximately  per month

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating us 
our concentration of assets in venezuela increases our exposure to production disruptions and project execution risk 
political and economic uncertainty is very high in venezuela 
currently  the production from the south monagas unit in venezuela represents all of our production  and revenue and cash flow will be adversely affected if production from the south monagas unit decreases significantly for any reason 
from december  through february   no sales were made because of pdvsa s inability to accept our oil due to the national civil work stoppage in venezuela 
as a result  sales were reduced by approximately million barrels and sales were reduced by an estimated million barrels 
as a result of the venezuelan national civil work stoppage  the venezuelan government terminated several thousand pdvsa employees and announced a restructuring of pdvsa s operations 
throughout  there have been numerous organizational changes in pdvsa 
as a result of the situation in pdvsa  its payment to benton vinccler for crude oil delivered in the fourth quarter of was late by seven days 
however  all other payments have been on time  and we believe pdvsa is committed to building its production levels and returning to more normalized business relations with its customers and suppliers 
there are ongoing efforts by opponents of president chavez for a constitutional recall referendum 
a successful recall referendum could lead to new presidential elections 
these events create civil unrest and the possibility of work stoppages or disruptions 
the political uncertainty and economic instability in venezuela could adversely affect our operations and business prospects in that country 
in addition  while the effect of the changes and the possible politicalization of pdvsa cannot be predicted  it could adversely affect pdvsa s ability to manage its contracts and meet its obligations with its suppliers and vendors  such as benton vinccler 
organizational instability and uncertainty at pdvsa could also adversely affect our ability to acquire new projects in venezuela and the timing of those acquisitions 
while we have substantial cash reserves to withstand a future 
table of contents disruption of sales  a prolonged loss of sales or a failure or delay by pdvsa to pay our invoices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have been required to curtail sales to pdvsa in april and december due to insufficient crude oil storage capacity 
while these appear to be isolated incidents  we cannot be assured that our sales to pdvsa will not be curtailed in the future in the same manner 
our strategy to focus on russia carries operating  financial  legal and political risk 
while we believe our established presence in russia and our experience and skills from prior operations positions us well for future projects  doing business in russia also carries unique risks 
the operating environment is often difficult  and the ability to operate successfully will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to control the pace of development  apply best practices in drilling and development  and the fostering of relationships with russian partners  the local community and governmental authorities 
financial risks include our ability to control costs and attract financing for russian projects  while remaining within our existing debt covenants 
in addition  the russian legal system is not mature and its reliability is uncertain 
this may affect our ability to enforce contracts and achieve certainty in our rights to develop and operate oil and gas projects  as well as our ability to obtain adequate compensation for any resulting losses 
acquiring new projects in venezuela depends upon our ability to meet the requirements of the organic hydrocarbon law 
new oil projects in venezuela are governed by the organic hydrocarbon law which requires that such projects be carried out through incorporated joint ventures with majority ownership by governmental entities 
while we believe it is possible to comply with the organic hydrocarbons law and at the same time meet our criteria for new projects  no precedents exist and there is a risk we will be unable to achieve the desired result 
operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations  and our strategy to focus on venezuela and russia limits our country risk diversification 
our operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  war  insurrection  civil unrest  strikes and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations 
our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  taxation and the possibility of having to be subject to exclusive jurisdiction of courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the united states 
our strategy to focus on venezuela and russia concentrates our foreign operations risk and increases the potential impact to us of the operating  financial and political risks in those countries 
our foreign operations expose us to foreign currency risk 
presently  our only operations are located in venezuela 
venezuela has historically been considered a highly inflationary economy 
results of operations in that country are measured in us dollars  and all currency gains or losses recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
there are many factors which affect foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our influence 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan currency to the us dollar 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates 
our venezuelan receipts are denominated in us dollars  and most expenditures are in us dollars as well 
for a discussion of currency controls in venezuela  see capital resources and liquidity below 
successful acquisition of projects in russia may also expose us to foreign currency risk in that country 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our strategy 
we are a small organization and depend on the skills and experience of a few individuals in key management and operating positions to execute our business strategy 
loss of one or more key individuals in the organization could hamper or delay achieving our strategy 
leverage materially affects our operations 
as of december   our long term debt was million 
our long term debt represented percent of our total capitalization at december  our current 
table of contents cash balances are in excess of these obligations and lessen the impact of our debt but our long term debt can effect our operations in several important ways  including the following a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is used to pay interest on borrowings  our single largest indebtedness of million is due in november the covenants contained in the indentures governing such debt limits our ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets  the covenants contained in the indentures governing our debt affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  the level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes  and the terms of the indentures governing our debt permit our creditors to accelerate payments upon an event of default or a change of control 
the total capital required for development of new fields may exceed our ability to finance 
our future capital requirements for new projects may exceed the cash available from existing free cash flow and cash on hand 
our ability to acquire financing is uncertain and may be affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
because of the financial risk factors in the countries in which we operate  we may not be able to secure either the equity or debt financing necessary to meet any future cash needs for investment  which may limit our ability to fully develop new projects  cause delays with their development or require early divestment of all or a portion of those projects 
our current and future revenue is subject to concentrated counter party risk 
our current operations in venezuela rely on production fee payments from pdvsa for all revenue receipts 
we do not own the hydrocarbons and do not sell oil and gas in open markets 
future projects in venezuela  russia and other countries may involve similar production fee payments from a limited number of companies or governments 
we may not be able to invest the net cash proceeds from the sale of geoilbent in new oil and gas projects 
the terms of the notes require that net cash proceeds in excess of million from the sale of geoilbent must be invested in the oil and gas business within one year of the sale  or any amount not so invested must be used to repay or prepay the notes or certain debts of subsidiaries 
oil price declines and volatility could adversely affect our revenue  cash flows and profitability 
prices for oil fluctuate widely 
the average price we received for oil in venezuela increased to per bbl for the year ended december   compared to per bbl for the year ended december  in november  we began selling natural gas in venezuela under an addendum to our operating service contract at per mcf and incremental crude oil at per bbl 
while this diversifies our revenue stream  revenues  profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to service our debt 
in addition  we may have ceiling test write downs when prices decline 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil that we can produce economically and lower oil production could affect the amount of natural gas we can produce 
we cannot predict future oil prices 
factors that can cause this fluctuation include relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil  market uncertainty  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political and economic conditions in oil producing countries  and overall economic conditions 
lower oil and natural gas prices or downward adjustments to our reserves may cause us to record ceiling limitation write downs 
we use the full cost method of accounting to report our oil and natural gas operations 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at percent  
table of contents plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce stockholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
the consolidated financial statements of the wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries do not include ceiling test write downs in equity in net losses of affiliated companies includes a million our share ceiling test write down recorded by geoilbent during their fiscal year ending september  estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
this form k contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
such process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
actual production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses with respect to our reserves will likely vary from the estimates used 
such variances may be material 
at december   approximately percent of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped 
undeveloped reserves  by their nature  are less certain 
recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the estimates of our future reserves include the assumption that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop these reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results will be as estimated 
see supplemental information on oil and natural gas producing activities 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues referred to is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in demand  our ability to produce or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the percent discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and our risks or the risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the percent discount factor 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves 
in general  production rates and remaining reserves from oil and gas properties decline as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
our reserves in the south monagas unit in venezuela will decline as they are produced unless we acquire additional properties in venezuela  russia or elsewhere with proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities 
our future oil and natural gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain 
we may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we cannot assure you that our future exploration  development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 

table of contents our operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions  shortages in experienced labor  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment  and delays in receipt of permits or access to lands 
the prevailing price of oil also affects the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
we cannot assure you that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable 
drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs 
the oil and natural gas industry experiences numerous operating risks 
these operating risks include the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pump and pipe failures  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards 
environmental hazards include oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these industry operating risks occur  we could have substantial losses 
substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
competition within the industry may adversely affect our operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
we compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various foreign governmental regulations 
these regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions 
matters regulated may include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations  bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
at various times  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and gas production 
in order to conserve or limit supplies of oil and natural gas  these agencies have restricted the rates of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity 
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
financial and operational performance in  we strengthened our management team and board of directors  added to our financial flexibility by completing the sale of geoilbent for million in cash plus million for repayment of our intercompany debt and accounts receivable  added a gas revenue stream and advanced our growth plan by announcing an agreement with pdvsa to study two oil and gas fields close to our facilities in venezuela 
at december   we had million of cash and a debt to total capitalization ratio of percent compared with percent at the end of 
table of contents our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of our common stock 
in march we repurchased approximately  shares for an aggregate price of million 
capital program benton vinccler s capital expenditures for are projected to be million  compared with capital expenditures of million 
the capital program includes plans for ten wells in proved undeveloped reserves and related facilities at uracoa for approximately million as well as the start of the engineering and design studies at east bombal in anticipation of gas sales in in  we completed our three well bombal field development program in venezuela and constructed a pipeline from bombal to the tucupita delivery line 
the bombal drilling program delivered disappointing results 
instead of initial flush production with little or no water  the wells experienced early water breakthrough and consequently lower oil production 
benton vinccler converted two gas injection wells in uracoa to gas production and completed the gas project and facilities improvements on time at a cost of million 
results of operations we include the results of operations of benton vinccler in our consolidated financial statements and reflect the percent ownership interest of vinccler as a minority interest 
we accounted for our investments in geoilbent and arctic gas using the equity method 
we include geoilbent and arctic gas in our consolidated financial statements based on a fiscal year ending september our results of operations for the years ended december   and reflect the results of geoilbent until sold on september  and arctic gas until sold on april  for the twelve months ended september   and you should read the following discussion of the results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  and the financial condition as of december  and in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto

our sales quantities for the year ended 
table of contents from venezuela were mboe compared with mboe in the decrease in sales quantities of mboe  or percent  was due to the venezuelan national civil work stoppage which led to the shut in of our production from december to february  natural reservoir decline rates and the fact that some wells did not immediately return to previous production levels following the national work stoppage 
our operating expenses decreased million  or percent  for the year ended compared with this was primarily due to lower production volumes partially offset by higher workover and maintenance programs that continued during the venezuelan national civil work stoppage

table of contents our results of operations for the year ended primarily reflected the results for benton vinccler in venezuela  which accounted for all of our production and oil sales revenue 
as a result of increases in world crude oil prices  partially offset by lower production from the south monagas unit  oil sales in venezuela were percent higher in compared with realized fees per barrel increased percent from in to in 
our revenues increased million  or percent  during the year ended compared with this was due to increased oil sales revenue in venezuela as a result of increases in world crude oil prices  partially offset by lower sales quantities 
our sales quantities for the year ended from venezuela were mmbbls compared to mmbbls for the year ended the decrease in sales quantities of  bbls  or less than percent  was due primarily to logistics and equipment delays in early at the tucupita field and the venezuelan national civil work stoppage which led to the shut in of our production in late december for nine days 
average production for the year decreased by less than bbls per day for the aforementioned reasons 
our operating expenses decreased million  or percent  for the year ended compared with the year ended lower fuel gas  water and oil treatments accounted for million of the reduction 
reduced workover expense million and lower expenses associated with the transportation of tucupita oil million with the completion of the tucupita oil pipeline in late were offset by million of increases in various other categories 
depletion  depreciation and amortization increased million  or percent  during the year ended compared with primarily due to the first three quarters of having been calculated on the lower beginning of the year reserves

equity in net earnings of affiliated companies decreased million  during the year ended compared with this was primarily due to the decreased income from geoilbent and the elimination of arctic gas equity income on april   the date of its sale 

table of contents capital resources and liquidity the oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business with unique operating and financial risks see risk factors 
we require capital principally to service our debt and to fund the following costs drilling and completion costs of wells and the cost of production  treating and transportation facilities  geological  geophysical and seismic costs  and acquisition of interests in oil and gas properties 
the amount of available capital will affect the scope of our operations and the rate of our growth 
we began selling venezuelan natural gas in november  but our future rate of growth also depends substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to service our debt 
on february   the government of venezuela fixed the exchange rate between the bolivar and the us dollar  and restricted the ability to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and vice versa 
initially the exchange rate was fixed at  venezuelan bolivars for each us dollar 
on february   the official exchange rate was adjusted to  venezuelan bolivars for each us dollar 
oil companies  such as benton vinccler are allowed to receive payments for oil sales in us dollars and pay us dollar denominated expenses from those payments 
the full amount of the bolivar denominated debt was repaid as of march  as of march   we have cash reserves of approximately million and do not expect the currency conversion restriction to adversely affect our ability to meet our short term loan obligations 
our ability to pay interest on our debt and general corporate overhead is dependent upon the ability of benton vinccler to make loan repayments  dividends and other cash payments to us 
however  there have been  and may again be  unforeseeable interruptions in oil and gas sales or there may be contractual obligations or legal impediments such as the recently instituted currency controls to receiving dividends or distributions from benton vinccler  which could prohibit benton vinccler from remitting funds to us 
management does not believe that the currency controls will prohibit our ability to receive funds from benton vinccler  although were it to do so  our ability to meet our cash requirements would be adversely affected 
debt reduction 
we currently have a significant debt principal obligation payable in million 
by september   we may be obligated to repay or prepay some portion of this debt with some of the net cash proceeds from the sale of geoilbent see risk factors 
in  benton vinccler borrowed million from a venezuelan commercial bank for the construction of an oil pipeline 
a portion of the loan was denominated in bolivars and was repaid as of march  working capital 
our capital resources and liquidity are affected by the timing of our semiannual interest payments of approximately million each may and november on the percent senior notes due in november and by receipt of the quarterly payments from pdvsa at the end of the months of february  may  august and november pursuant to the terms of the operating service agreement for the south monagas unit 
as a consequence of the timing of these interest payment outflows and the pdvsa payment inflows  our cash balances can increase and decrease dramatically on a few dates during the year 
in each may and november in particular  interest payments at the beginning of the month and pdvsa payments at the end of the month create large swings in our cash balances 
benton vinccler s oil and gas pipeline project loans allow the lender to accelerate repayment if production ceases for a period greater than thirty days 
during the production shut in which started in december  benton vinccler was granted a waiver of this provision until february  in exchange for a prepayment of the next two principal obligations aggregating million 
this prepayment  while using cash reserves  reduced our net interest expense as the current interest expense was more than the current interest income earned on the invested funds 
on february   benton vinccler commenced production  thereby eliminating the need for an additional waiver 
a future disruption of production could trigger the debt acceleration provision again 
while no assurances can be given  we believe benton vinccler would be able to obtain another waiver under acceptable terms and conditions 
the net funds raised and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below 
table of contents year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash at december   we had current assets of million and current liabilities of million  resulting in working capital of million and a current ratio of this compares with a working capital of million and a current ration of at december  the increase in working capital of million was primarily due to the sale of our minority equity investment in geoilbent 
cash flow from operating activities 
during the years ended december  and  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
the million decrease was primarily due to lower oil revenues offset by the commencement of gas sales in the fourth quarter of cash flow from investing activities 
during the years ended december  and  we had drilling and production related capital expenditures of approximately million and million  respectively 
of the expenditures  million was attributable to the development of the south monagas unit  million to the construction of the gas pipeline and the balance for other administrative property 
the timing and size of capital expenditures for the south monagas unit are entirely at our discretion 
our remaining capital commitments worldwide support our search for new acquisitions  and are relatively minimal and substantially at our discretion 
we will also be required to make annual interest payments of approximately million on the notes 
we continue to assess production levels and commodity prices in conjunction with our capital resources and liquidity requirements 
cash flow from financing activities 
during  benton vinccler repaid the balance of their bolivar denominated debt of million and other debt of million 
during  we paid million in percent senior unsecured notes due may   million in percent senior unsecured notes due november  and benton vinccler repaid other debt of million 
in november  we issued million in percent senior unsecured notes due november   of which we repurchased million 
interest on these notes is due may and november of each year 
the indenture agreements provide for certain limitations on liens  additional indebtedness  certain investment and capital expenditures  dividends  mergers and sales of assets 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of the indenture 
contractual obligations 
we have a lease obligation of approximately  per month for our houston office space 
this lease is valid through august the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  payments in thousands due by period less than contractual obligation total year years years long term debt office lease total while we can give no assurance  we currently believe that our cash flow from operations coupled with our cash and marketable securities on hand will provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to fund our planned capital expenditures  investments in and advances to affiliates  and semiannual interest payment obligations for the next months 
our expectation is based upon our current estimate of projected prices  production levels  and our assumptions that there will be no further disruptions to our production and that pdvsa will timely pay our invoices 
actual results could be materially affected if there is a significant change in our expectations or assumptions 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including  but not limited to  the level of production and prices  as well 
table of contents as various economic and political conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business 
additionally  prices for oil are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of factors beyond our control 
we currently have a significant debt obligation of million payable in november our ability to meet our debt obligation and to reduce our level of debt depends on the successful implementation of our business strategy 
effects of changing prices  foreign exchange rates and inflation our results of operations and cash flow are affected by changing oil prices 
fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices may affect our total planned development activities and capital expenditure program 
as noted above under capital resources and liquidity  venezuela imposed currency exchange restrictions in february  and adjusted the official exchange rate in february we do not expect the currency conversion restrictions or the adjustment in the exchange rate to have a material impact on us at this time 
within the united states  inflation has had a minimal effect on us  but it is potentially an important factor in results of operations in venezuela 
with respect to benton vinccler  a significant majority of the sources of funds  including the proceeds from oil sales  our contributions and credit financings  are denominated in us dollars  while a minor amount of local transactions in venezuela are conducted in local currency 
if the rate of increase in the value of the us dollar compared with the bolivar continues to be less than the rate of inflation in venezuela  then inflation could be expected to have an adverse effect on benton vinccler 
during the year ended december   our net foreign exchange gain attributable to our international operations was million 
the us dollar and bolivar exchange rates were fixed in february and no gains or losses were recognized after february however  there are many factors affecting foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our control 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan currency to the us dollar 
it is not possible for us to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates and exchange controls 
critical accounting policies principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
the equity method of accounting is used for companies and other investments in which we have significant influence 
all intercompany profits  transactions and balances have been eliminated 
we account for our investment in geoilbent and arctic gas based on a fiscal year ending september prior to their respective sales 
oil and natural gas revenue is accrued monthly based on sales 
each quarter  benton vinccler invoices pdvsa based on barrels of oil accepted by pdvsa during the quarter  using quarterly adjusted us dollar contract service fees per barrel 
property and equipment we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties with costs accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized as incurred  including exploration overhead 
only overhead that is directly identified with acquisition  exploration or development activities is capitalized 
all costs related to production  general corporate overhead and similar activities are expensed as incurred 
the costs for china unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
at least annually  we evaluate our unproved property for possible impairment 
if we abandon all exploration efforts in china where no proved reserves are assigned  all exploration and acquisition costs associated with the country will be expensed 
due to the unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities  the amount and timing of impairment expenses are difficult to predict with any certainty 
the full cost method of accounting uses proved reserves in the calculation of depletion  depreciation and amortization 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological 
table of contents and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are those which are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved reserves cannot be measured exactly  and the estimation of reserves involves judgmental determinations 
reserve estimates must be reviewed and adjusted periodically to reflect additional information gained from reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data and economic changes 
the estimates are based on current technology and economic conditions  and we consider such estimates to be reasonable and consistent with current knowledge of the characteristics and extent of production 
the estimates include only those amounts considered to be proved reserves and do not include additional amounts which may result from new discoveries in the future  or from application of secondary and tertiary recovery processes where facilities are not in place or for which transportation and or marketing contracts are not in place 
changes in previous estimates of proved reserves result from new information obtained from production history and changes in economic factors 
a large portion of our proved reserves base from consolidated operations is comprised of oil and gas properties that are sensitive to oil price volatility 
we are susceptible to significant upward and downward revisions to our proved reserve volumes and values as a result of changes in year end oil and gas prices and the corresponding adjustment to the projected economic life of such properties 
prices for oil and gas are likely to continue to be volatile  resulting in future revision to our proved reserve base 
we perform a quarterly cost center ceiling test of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the sec 
these rules generally require that we price our future oil and gas production at the oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write down if our capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
we have had no write downs due to these ceiling test limitations since other than the write downs recorded by our equity affiliates 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved reserves will change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future  even if only for a short period of time  write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur 
write downs required by these rules do not directly impact our cash flows from operating activities 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects  calculated at currently enacted rates  of a future deductible taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements or income tax returns  and b operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
foreign currency our current operations are in venezuela 
the us dollar is our functional and reporting currency 
amounts denominated in non us currencies are re measured in u 
s dollars  and all currency gains or losses are recorded in the statement of operations 
we attempt to manage our operations in such a manner as to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange losses 
however  there are many factors that affect foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our influence 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan bolivar to the us dollar 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity the statement 
the statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement is generally effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this statement had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries 
a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the enterprise that has the 
table of contents majority of the risks or rewards associated with the vie 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin  interpretation no 
r fin r  to clarify some of the provisions of fin  and to defer certain entities from adopting until the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  application of fin r is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application for all other types of vies is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  we believe we have no arrangements that would require the application of fin r 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  interest rates  foreign exchange and political risk  as discussed below 
oil prices as an independent oil producer  our revenue  other income and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
historically  prices received for oil production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
through february   we utilized a costless collar hedge transaction with respect to a portion of our oil production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  and establish an acceptable rate of return on our tucupita drilling program  as well as to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
benton vinccler hedged a portion of its oil production by purchasing a wti crude oil put to protect its cash flow 
because gains or losses associated with hedging transactions are included in oil sales when the hedged production is delivered  such gains and losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the commodities 
see note derivatives and hedging for a complete discussion of our derivative activity 
currently  we have no hedging transactions in place for our production 
interest rates total long term debt at december  of million consisted of fixed rate senior unsecured notes maturing in million 
benton vinccler has million of us dollar denominated variable rate loans 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in the interest rate would not have a material affect on our results of operations 
foreign exchange for the venezuelan operations  oil and gas sales are received under a contract in effect through in us dollars  expenditures are both in us dollars and local currency 
we have utilized no currency hedging programs to mitigate any risks associated with operations in these countries  and therefore our financial results are subject to favorable or unfavorable fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation in these countries 
venezuela has recently imposed currency exchange controls see capital resources and liquidity above 
political risk political and economic uncertainty remains very high in venezuela 
during  the production from the south monagas unit in venezuela represented all of our total production from consolidated companies 
our production  revenue and cash flow will be adversely affected if production from the south monagas unit decreases significantly for any reason 
from december  through february   no sales were made because of pdvsa s inability to accept our oil due to the national civil work stoppage in venezuela 
as a result  sales were reduced by approximately million barrels and sales were reduced by an estimated million barrels 
as a result of the venezuelan national civil work stoppage  the venezuelan government terminated several thousand pdvsa employees and announced a restructuring of pdvsa s operations 
throughout  there have been numerous organizational changes in pdvsa 
as a result of the situation in pdvsa  its payment to benton vinccler for crude delivered in the fourth quarter of was late by seven days 
however  all other payments have been on time  and we believe pdvsa is committed to building its production levels and returning to more normalized business relations with its customers and suppliers 

table of contents there are ongoing efforts by opponents of president chavez for a constitutional recall referendum 
a successful recall referendum could lead to new presidential elections 
these events create civil unrest and the possibility of work stoppages or disruptions 
the political uncertainty and economic instability in venezuela could adversely affect our operations and business prospects in that country 
in addition  while the effect of the changes and the possible politicalization of pdvsa cannot be predicted  it could adversely affect pdvsa s ability to manage its contracts and meet its obligations with its suppliers and vendors  such as benton vinccler 
organizational instability and uncertainty at pdvsa could also adversely affect our ability to acquire new projects in venezuela and the timing of those acquisitions 
while we have substantial cash reserves to withstand a future disruption of sales  a prolonged loss of sales or a failure or delay by pdvsa to pay our invoices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
