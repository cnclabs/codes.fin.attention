item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview datascope corp 
is a diversified medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets proprietary products for clinical health care markets in interventional cardiology and radiology  cardiovascular and vascular surgery  anesthesiology  emergency medicine and critical care 
we have four product lines that are aggregated into two reportable segments  cardiac assist monitoring products and interventional products vascular grafts 
the cardiac assist monitoring products segment accounts for of total sales 
our products are sold by direct sales representatives in the united states and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in international markets 
our largest geographic markets are the united states  europe and japan 
we believe that customers  primarily hospitals and other medical institutions  choose among competing products on the basis of product performance  features  price and service 
in general  we believe price has become an important factor in hospital purchasing decisions because of pressure to cut costs 
these pressures on hospitals result from federal and state regulations that limit reimbursement for services provided to medicare and medicaid patients 
there are also cost containment pressures on healthcare systems outside the us  particularly in certain european countries 
many companies  some of which are substantially larger than us  are engaged in manufacturing competing products 
our products are generally not affected by economic cycles 
our sales growth depends in part upon the successful development and marketing of new products 
we have continued our emphasis on new product development and have increased our investment in research and development r d 
in fiscal we spent million on r d  an increase of million or from fiscal we expect to increase r d spending in fiscal as compared to we also plan to increase sales through selective acquisitions of products and technologies from other companies 
during the past two years we have made investments in several new technologies  including the prolumen tm thrombectomy device and the x site vascular closure device 
we have also improved our operating margins through increasing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and cost containment programs 
datascope s financial position continued strong at the end of fiscal  with cash and short and long term marketable investments at million compared to million at june  the increase resulted primarily from positive cash flow from operations 
results of operations financial summary the following table shows the comparison of net earnings and earnings per diluted share over the past three fiscal years 
dollars in millions  except eps year ended june  net earnings earnings per share  diluted the increase in net earnings and diluted earnings per share in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily reflects an increase in earnings from higher sales  an improved gross margin percentage in the cardiac assist monitoring products segment and a lower consolidated effective tax rate 
partially offsetting the above were reduced earnings in the interventional products vascular grafts segment 
net earnings and earnings per share in fiscal years and shown above include the following items gain on legal settlement of million after tax or per diluted share in fiscal and restructuring charges of million after tax or per diluted share in fiscal comparison of results fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales sales the following table shows sales by product line over the past three fiscal years 
sales by product line dollars in millions year ended june  patient monitoring change from prior year of total sales cardiac assist change from prior year of total sales interventional products change from prior year of total sales vascular grafts change from prior year of total sales genisphere change from prior year of total sales total sales change from prior year sales of the cardiac assist monitoring products segment in fiscal increased to million from million last year 
patient monitoring patient monitoring sales in fiscal rose to million compared to million last year 
the increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher sales of bedside monitors  including the recently introduced spectrum tm and trio tm monitors  increased sales of masimo set r pulse oximetry sensors and favorable foreign exchange translation of million 
sales of central monitoring systems decreased in fiscal because of the introduction of our new panorama tm central monitoring system 
during the fourth quarter  many customers placed substantial new orders for panorama  or replaced existing orders for the older patientnet central system with orders for panorama 
only a small number of panorama units were shipped in the fourth quarter  consistent with our policy of limiting new central monitoring system shipments in the first period after product release 
the panorama patient monitoring network is our new platform for centralized monitoring of vital signs information 
the panorama is an integrated family of patient monitoring products that will enable hospitals to seamlessly share information on all patients via one network 
its user interface will be integrated with our passport r and spectrum monitors 
this will simplify user training  will enable the capture and storage of all data including continuous lead ecg acquisition  and will provide for control of bedside alarms 
additionally  the central station will store all waveform and numeric vital signs gathered by the monitors  creating a continuous electronic patient record 
panorama will also include a compact ambulatory telemetry transmitter  the panorama telepack  and an instrument transmitter  the panorama instrument radio  to wirelessly communicate patient data to and from the panorama central station 
masimo set is a registered trademark of masimo corporation 
panorama replaces a previous system purchased by us on an oem basis and sold by the patient monitoring division 
we anticipate that the launch of the panorama will strengthen our competitive position in the high end market and will increase sales of our wireless systems and of the spectrum  our high acuity and higher priced monitor 
we also anticipate a higher gross margin from sales of the new panorama system that has a lower manufacturing cost compared to the cost of the oem system 
cardiac assist cardiac assist sales in fiscal increased to million from million last year  due to continued higher sales of intra aortic balloon iab catheters and pumps  and favorable foreign exchange translation of million 
shipments of the premium priced fidelity tm fr 
iab catheter continued to increase  accounting for of total iab catheter sales in the fourth quarter 
increased purchases of iab s by our japanese distributor and higher shipments to other international markets also contributed to increased iab sales 
higher pump sales reflect continued strong demand for the new cs tm intra aortic balloon pump  our first fully automatic pump  launched globally in september sales of the interventional products vascular grafts segment decreased to million compared to million last year 
interventional products sales of interventional products decreased to million from million last year as sales of vasoseal r vascular closure devices continued to weaken  as a result of continued strong competition  and the decline was only partially offset by sales contributed by the new safeguard tm and prolumen products 
safeguard  a manual compression assist device designed to maintain hemostasis after arterial catheterization procedures  was launched in the second quarter 
prolumen is a new thrombectomy device designed to quickly and effectively clear blood clots from blocked dialysis access sites 
shipment of prolumen began at the end of the third quarter of fiscal aside from other new products being developed for the dialysis market  we have undertaken a number of new product initiatives with the intent of halting and reversing the decline of our vascular closure sales 
the first such initiative was announced in may when we acquired assets and technology from x site medical  llc x site 
the acquired assets include all technology related to x site s lead product  a suture based vascular closure device for achieving hemostasis after coronary catheterization procedures 
suture based devices represent over million of an estimated million annual market for vascular closure devices 
the x site product will be marketed by the interventional products division through its existing sales force  which currently sells other vascular closure devices 
vascular grafts sales of intervascular inc s products increased to million compared to million last year  with favorable foreign exchange contributing million to this year s results 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation  sales declined due to lower selling prices in certain european markets  lower sales in the us and reduced shipments to intervascular s distributor in japan 
in march  we resubmitted our k notification to the fda for regulatory clearance to market intergard r silver grafts in the united states 
in august  the fda requested that we provide additional data from our european postmarketing studies of the intergard silver 
genisphere sales of genisphere products were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  as genisphere continued to pursue its marketing strategy  to target major academic institutions and the research and development department of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
costs and expenses gross profit net sales less cost of sales the gross profit percentage was for fiscal compared to last year  with the increase primarily due to an improved gross margin percentage in the cardiac assist monitoring products segment  as a result of cost reduction programs and sales of new products with higher margins 
partially offsetting the above was the impact from a less favorable sales mix  as a result of reduced sales of higher margin interventional products and vascular grafts 
research and development r d we continued our companywide focus on new product development and improvements of existing products in fiscal spending on research and development reflects investment in new product development programs  sustaining r d on existing products  regulatory compliance and clinical evaluations 
total r d expenses increased to million in fiscal  equivalent to of sales compared to million  or of sales last year 
r d expenses for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million last year  with the increase primarily due to expenses related to recently introduced products including the cs intra aortic balloon pump in cardiac assist and the panorama  central monitoring network in patient monitoring  as well as new product development projects 
r d expenses for the interventional products vascular grafts segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million last year  with the increase primarily due to expenses related to new product development projects in intervascular 
the balance of consolidated r d is in corporate and other and amounted to million in fiscal compared to million for the comparable period last year 
selling  general and administrative sg a total selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  or of sales compared to million  or of sales last year 
sg a expenses for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal  primarily attributable to filling open field sales positions  costs associated with the increased sales and unfavorable foreign exchange translation million 
sg a expenses for the interventional products vascular grafts segment in fiscal were essentially unchanged compared to last year at million  as lower selling and marketing expenses in interventional products were offset by higher expenses in intervascular attributable to unfavorable foreign exchange translation 
segment sg a expenses include fixed corporate g a charges that are offset in corporate and other 
the weaker us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound increased total sg a expenses by approximately million in fiscal gain on legal settlement in july  we instituted patent infringement litigation relating to a vascular sealing method against vascular solutions  inc in the united states district court  district of minnesota 
in that litigation our complaint alleged that the manufacture  use and or sale of vascular solutions duett device infringed our united states patent no 
 in november  the parties settled the matter 
pursuant to the settlement  vascular solutions paid us million and we granted vascular solutions a limited  non exclusive patent license 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pretax gain on the settlement  net of related legal expenses  of million  or million after tax  equivalent to per diluted share 
interest income interest income was million in fiscal compared to million last year  with the increase primarily due to a higher average portfolio balance million vs 
million  partially offset by a decline in the average yield from to 
income taxes in fiscal  the consolidated effective tax rate was compared to last year 
the lower tax rate in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in the extraterritorial income exclusion eie and the federal research credit 
the increase in the eie was attributable to increased profits from higher us export sales 
the higher federal research credit resulted from increased r d expenses in fiscal last year  the effect on the consolidated tax rate of the gain on legal settlement was 
net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share in fiscal net earnings last year included a gain of million after tax or per diluted share  from the settlement of patent litigation with vascular solutions  inc the increased earnings in fiscal primarily reflects an increase in profits from higher sales  an improved gross margin in the cardiac assist monitoring products segment and a lower consolidated effective tax rate 
partially offsetting the above were reduced earnings in the interventional products vascular grafts segment 
purchased technology x site in may  we acquired certain assets and technology of x site medical  llc x site  a privately held company in the business of developing  manufacturing and marketing products for the vascular closure market 
the acquired assets include all technology related to x site s lead product  a suture based vascular closure device for achieving hemostasis after coronary catheterization procedures 
the x site purchase will broaden and enhance our existing vascular closure product line 
the purchase price was approximately million  in cash  comprised of an initial payment of million  including transaction expenses  and an accrued liability for an additional million  representing the present value of guaranteed minimum payments to be paid over the next five years 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  we may also be required to make additional contingent payments  which would be triggered by the achievement of certain milestones and sales performance levels not currently estimable 
the x site purchase was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the aggregate purchase price for x site was allocated to tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair value at date of acquisition 
there was no goodwill recorded in the transaction because the purchase price for this acquisition did not exceed the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
intangible assets acquired of million  consisting primarily of intellectual property and manufacturing know how  are being amortized over a period of approximately years based primarily on the remaining legal life of the underlying acquired technology 
an independent valuation firm was used to determine the fair market value of the intangible assets acquired 
prolumen in may  we acquired technology from rex medical  lp  for the prolumen thrombectomy device 
with the launch of the prolumen in march we entered the dialysis access market 
thrombectomy is the process of removing blood clots from blocked dialysis access sites 
thrombectomy procedures are performed primarily by interventional radiologists in the us  a current and well established sales call point for our interventional products division 
through june   we paid million in cash based on achieving certain milestones 
the technology transfer agreement also requires us to pay additional contingent payments  which would be triggered by the achievement of additional milestones and sales performance levels not currently estimable 
the payments made for the prolumen technology were recorded as purchased technology and will be amortized over approximately years based on the remaining legal life of the underlying technology 
foreign currency due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize net earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions which are primarily related to certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging activities do not subject us to exchange rate risk because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the intercompany receivables hedged 
the net gains or losses on these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are included within other  net  in our consolidated statement of earnings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of june   we had a notional amount of million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  all of which were in euros and british pounds 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed months and require us to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity  at rates agreed to when the contract is signed 
comparison of results fiscal vs 
fiscal sales sales of the cardiac assist monitoring products segment in fiscal increased to million from million last year 
cardiac assist cardiac assist product sales increased to million in fiscal the increase is due to stronger worldwide sales of intra aortic balloon pumps  a modest increase in sales of balloon iab catheters and the favorable effect of foreign exchange translation 
our distributor in japan reduced purchases of iab catheters in the first half of the fiscal year in order to reduce inventory and resumed its normal purchasing pattern in the second half of the year 
sales of the new  premium priced fidelity tm fr 
iab catheter continued to grow  accounting for of total iab catheter sales in the fourth quarter 
patient monitoring sales of patient monitoring products rose to million in fiscal the sales increase reflects strong growth of several product lines  including accutorr plus r noninvasive blood pressure monitors  wireless central monitoring systems  masimo set pulse oximetry sensors and the anestar tm anesthesia delivery system 
favorable foreign exchange translation also contributed to sales growth 
during the third quarter  we positioned ourselves for renewed growth in the bedside monitoring market segment with the introduction of two new monitors  spectrum tm and trio tm 
the spectrum monitor is a battery powered  portable bedside monitor for the high end  critical care market  a million market segment 
the trio is a compact and highly portable monitor with applications in a wide variety of hospital and outpatient settings 
it is aimed at price sensitive markets such as surgery centers  general hospital applications and international markets 
the trio should enable us to expand our share of an estimated million low end monitor market 
shipments of spectrum in the us and to international markets began in the third quarter 
shipments of trio to international markets began in the third quarter  and us sales are expected to begin in the first half of fiscal when fda market clearance is expected 
sales of bedside monitors increased in the fourth quarter following the introduction of these two new products 
sales of the interventional products vascular grafts segment decreased to million compared to million last year 
interventional products sales of vasoseal r sealing devices decreased to million from million last year due to continued strong competition and to the production problem that arose shortly after manufacturing of vasoseal elite tm began in the third quarter  which interrupted the launch of this next generation product 
this production problem was resolved and shipments of vasoseal elite devices  which incorporate a new  proprietary collagen hemostat  resumed in june 
sales of collagen hemostats were million compared to million last year with the decrease due to reduced sales in international markets 
during the first quarter of fiscal we changed the name of our collagen products division  which manufactures and markets the vasoseal devices  to the interventional products division 
the new name reflects our objective to broaden the product portfolio offered by the division to include new products for interventional cardiology and interventional radiology that are not collagen based 
the first of these new products  safeguard  an innovative pressure assisted dressing for post hemostasis wound management was launched in the first half of fiscal vascular grafts sales of intervascular  inc s products increased to million  primarily reflecting favorable foreign exchange translation  a full year of direct sales in the us  and increased sales of the intergard silver anti microbial graft in europe 
sales in the us were also higher than last year because our former distributor  whose termination became effective at the end of december  placed no orders in the second quarter last year 
we are continuing to seek fda approval to sell intergard silver grafts in the united states 
genisphere sales of genisphere products were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year  as genisphere continued to pursue its marketing strategy  to target major academic institutions and the research and development department of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the weaker us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound increased consolidated sales by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses the gross profit percentage of for fiscal was unchanged from last year 
an improved gross margin in the cardiac assist monitoring products segment as a result of cost reduction programs and higher average selling prices was offset by the effect of a less favorable sales mix  the write off of obsolete inventory related to the mr monitor line and costs associated with the vasoseal elite production problem 
in addition  for fiscal  the gross margin was favorably impacted by an insurance settlement of thousand recorded in the first quarter related to unusable collagen inventory  which was reserved for in june with a charge to cost of sales 
datascope filed a claim under its property insurance policy for the unusable collagen inventory 
when we received the insurance settlement of thousand  in the first quarter of fiscal  the settlement was accounted for as a reduction to cost of sales  consistent with the accounting treatment for the related inventory reserve 
we continued our companywide focus on new product development and improvements of existing products in fiscal spending on research and development reflects investment in new product development programs  sustaining r d on existing products  regulatory compliance and clinical evaluations

 in november  the parties settled the matter 
pursuant to the settlement  vascular solutions paid us million and we granted vascular solutions a limited  non exclusive patent license 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pretax gain on the settlement  net of related legal expenses  of million  or million after tax  equivalent to per diluted share 
restructuring charges in fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million the restructuring charges consisted of the following 
o severance expenses  asset write downs and contractual obligations related to the closure of the vasoseal manufacturing and r d facility in vaals  the netherlands  and severance expenses for us employees 
o asset write downs  severance expenses and contractual and incremental obligations associated with exiting the coronary stent sales business in europe  including the resulting impairment of our investments in amg and qualimed 
o closure of an unprofitable cardiac assist direct sales operation in a european country 
o workforce reductions in patient monitoring 
the workforce reductions totaled employees or of our worldwide employment

million 
income taxes in fiscal  the consolidated effective tax rate was compared to last year 
the consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal was significantly impacted by expenses related to the restructuring programs in the first and second quarters which were not deductible for tax purposes  primarily in international businesses 
the effect on the consolidated tax rate of the gain on legal settlement in fiscal and the restructuring charge in fiscal was and  respectively 
the remaining increase in the consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in state income tax rates 
net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share last year 
the increased earnings in fiscal primarily reflects an increased gross margin from higher sales in all product lines  except vasoseal  the gain on legal settlement million after tax  and the negative impact on earnings last year of the restructuring charges million after tax  partially offset by higher r d and sg a expenses  as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at june  was million compared to million at june  the current ratio was compared to at june  the decrease in working capital and the current ratio was primarily the result of a decrease in cash and short term investments million and accounts receivable million  and an increase in current liabilities million 
partially offsetting the above was an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets million and inventories million 
the decrease in cash and short term investments was primarily due to our decision to invest more funds in long term investments to increase the investment yield on the portfolio 
long term investments increased million at june  compared to june  the decrease in accounts receivable of million primarily reflected a decrease in days sales outstanding resulting from tighter control over the granting of credit terms and improved collections 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million resulted primarily from an increase in prepaid income taxes 
the increase in inventories was attributable to the build up of inventory for new products  such as the panorama central monitoring system  prolumen  safeguard and elite 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was million compared to million last year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in inventories and other current assets  as discussed above 
net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily attributable to purchases of investments of million  offset by million for maturities of investments  million for purchased technology and licenses  million for capitalized software and the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million  due to million dividends paid and stock repurchases of million  offset by stock option activity of million 
purchases of technology and licenses included cash payments for the x site assets and technology of million and milestone payments to rex medical  lp for the prolumen and others devices of million 
we purchased about  of our common shares for approximately million during fiscal year working capital at june  was million compared to million at june  the current ratio was compared to at june  the increase in working capital and the current ratio was primarily the result of an increase in cash and short term investments million and a decrease in current liabilities million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable million and inventories million

we purchased about  of our common shares for approximately million during fiscal year we believe our financial resources are sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements 
the moderate rate of current us inflation has not significantly affected us 
the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations  primarily the euro and british pound  did not have a significant impact on our liquidity 
consistent with recent business and financial plans  the company has concluded that we may no longer hold our investment portfolio to maturity 
accordingly  we reclassified the investment portfolio from held to maturity to available for sale  excluding the preferred stock investments 
presented below is a summary of our contractual obligations and other commitments as of june  dollars in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase commitments  contingent milestone payments total contractual obligations and other commitments in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  these obligations are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
these amounts include commitments for inventory and capital expenditures that do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business 
these amounts represent contingent milestone payments under various agreements  including x site and rex medical 
while it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made  we have included the payments in the table based on our estimate of the earliest date when the milestones or contingencies may be met 
information concerning forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of many important factors 
many of these important factors cannot be predicted or quantified and are outside our control  including the possibility that the release of the panorama will not strengthen the company s competitive position in the high end market  or increase sales of wireless systems and the spectrum monitor because of the risk that planned enhancements to the initial launch version of the panorama are not completed in a timely manner  or the possibility that margins in the patient monitoring division will not improve  market conditions may change  particularly as the result of competitive activity in the cardiac assist  vascular sealing and other markets served by the company  the company s dependence on certain unaffiliated suppliers including single source manufacturers for patient monitoring  cardiac assist and interventional products and the company s ability to gain market acceptance for new products 
additional risks are the ability of the company to successfully introduce new products  continued demand for the company s products generally  rapid and significant changes that characterize the medical device industry and the ability to continue to respond to such changes  the uncertain timing of regulatory approvals  as well as other risks detailed in documents filed by us with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an on going basis and adjust as necessary to accurately reflect current conditions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on current and historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates o revenue recognition we recognize revenue and all related costs  including warranty costs  when title and risk of loss passes to the customer and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized for products shipped fob shipping point when they leave our premises 
revenue is recognized for products shipped fob destination when they reach the customer 
for certain products where we maintain consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized at the time we are notified that the product has been used by the customer 
we record estimated sales returns as a reduction of net sales in the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
historical experience is used to estimate an accrual for future returns relating to recorded sales  as well as estimated warranty costs 
revenue for service repairs and maintenance is recognized after service has been completed  and service contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
for certain products  revenue is recognized individually for delivered components when undelivered components  such as installation  are not essential to their functionality 
post shipment obligations for training commitments are considered perfunctory  and sales are recognized when delivered with provision for incremental costs 
o allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is used to state trade receivables at estimated net realizable value 
we rely on prior experience to estimate cash which ultimately will be collected from the gross receivables balance at period end 
such amount cannot be known with certainty at the financial statement date 
we maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that will likely not be collectible due to customer liquidity issues 
we also maintain an allowance for estimated future collection losses on existing receivables  determined based on historical trends 
o inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
inventory reserves are recorded to report inventory at its estimated fair market value 
a reserve is recorded for inventory specifically identified as slow moving or obsolete 
in addition  a reserve is recorded based upon our historical experience with inventory becoming obsolete due to age  changes in technology and other factors 
o income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess whether it will be more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that we cannot conclude that recovery is likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
at june   we had approximately million of gross deferred tax assets  including net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that will expire from to if not utilized 
we have recorded a valuation allowance at june  of million for the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  which we believe will not be fully realized based upon our estimates of future taxable income 
we have not recorded us deferred income taxes on our international subsidiaries undistributed earnings  because such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the united states indefinitely 
however  should we change our business and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of our us subsidiaries  additional us tax liabilities would be incurred 
in the normal course of business  we will undergo scheduled reviews by taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of tax credits and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
tax reviews frequently require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years subject to audit 
our us income tax returns for fiscal and prior years have been audited by the internal revenue service and are closed 
in the us  the statutory audit period has expired for fiscal years and  and is open for subsequent years 
o pension plan actuarial assumptions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements 
we use several actuarial and other statistical factors which attempt to estimate the ultimate expense and liability related to our pension plans 
these factors include assumptions about discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
in addition  subjective assumptions  such as withdrawal and mortality rates are utilized 
the actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences  depending on their magnitude  could have a significant impact on the amount of pension expense we record in any particular period 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r replaces the same titled fin that was issued in january fin r identifies when entities must be consolidated with the financial statements of a company where the investors in an entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or the entity does not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
application of this interpretation applies to our financial statements beginning january  the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

sfas no 
revised is effective for fiscal years ending after december  and for interim periods beginning after december  based on these effective dates  we have provided the additional interim disclosures beginning with our third quarter ended march  and the annual disclosures beginning with our fiscal year ended june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize net earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions which are primarily related to certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging activities do not subject us to exchange rate risk because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the intercompany receivables hedged 
the net gains or losses on these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are included within other  net  in our consolidated statements of earnings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
none of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as economic hedges of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
as a result  no foreign currency transaction gains or losses were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended june   and as of june   we had a notional amount of million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  all of which were in euros and british pounds 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed months and require us to exchange foreign currencies for united states dollars at maturity  at rates agreed to when the contract is signed
