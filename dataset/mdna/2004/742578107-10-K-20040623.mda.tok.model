item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
production and manufacturing we believe the quality and price performance of our products are instrumental to our success 
as a result  we utilize concurrent design and manufacturing in the development of our products by incorporating our manufacturing processes with the product design 
we source our own raw materials and components from a variety of suppliers 
we assemble our printer products on a configure to order basis 
raw materials we purchase custom mechanical and both custom and standard electronic components from numerous outside suppliers 
most of those components used in our impact and thermal printers are available from alternate sources should an issue arise with the existing source 
tooling is typically transferable to a new source with minimal ramp up time to full production capabilities 
we also purchase certain components from sole sources and have no reason to believe that supply from these sources would be placed in jeopardy 
if we were to lose any sole source for a component  there could be a delay in shipment of printers requiring those components until an alternate source could be ramped to fulfill production requirements 
safety stock is typically maintained for such long lead time items 
our laser printer products are designed to use specific proprietary print engines and printer assemblies manufactured by outside suppliers 
we have entered into written purchase agreements for these printer components and have no reason to believe that we will be unable to obtain the materials required 
engineering and development printronix operates in an industry that is subject to technological change  and our ability to compete successfully depends upon  among other things  our ability to anticipate market needs and to respond quickly with new solutions 
we invest a larger share of our revenue in research and development  about percent versus six percent  than our competitors 
accordingly  we are committed to a product development process that is coupled to market requirements and facilitates high quality  rapid  product development and introduction 
engineering and development expenditures were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year and have remained relatively constant in spite of the decrease in revenue 
engineering personnel are located in all three key regions the americas  europe  and asia pacific 
for fiscal year  product development focused on a three pronged strategy introduce new products to open 
table of contents new markets  broaden product lines within existing markets  and enhance existing products to support regional expansion in the asian markets 
the most significant change from prior years was a strategic shift to develop a new line of thermal printers to support wal mart and the dod s rfid initiatives 
in addition  the t thermal family was further enhanced to add additional data stream interpreters to work in tec and intermec applications 
in addition  a general purpose interface was released to support a broad base of post processing external devices  including print and apply applicators  which were released in the first quarter of fiscal the applicator prints the smart label and applies it to the case without manual intervention 
to address the market need for industrial grade transaction printing  a zero tear version of the p line matrix pedestal printer was developed and launched in late fiscal  which eliminates preprinted forms waste by printing single sheets 
to facilitate regional expansion  the p line sold into asian markets received a new high speed controller coupled with regional specific enhancements for both distribution and oem version printers 
expenditures were made in fiscal year to develop the wireless printers  the te  the pd  and the ps  an enhanced version of the p research and development expenditures were made in fiscal year to enhance our suite of enterprise system printing solutions 
these enhancements included introduction of printnet enterprise  a significant innovation in enterprise network printer management  the p  new network printing protocols  feature and language enhancements to the t thermal printers  and odv enhancements 
intellectual property we operate in an industry characterized by technological change and  as a result  we rely on patents  licenses  trade secrets  non disclosure agreements from third parties and other rights we may have to protect our intellectual property 
printronix has been issued united states and related foreign patents primarily in canada  the united kingdom  france and germany associated with various aspects of our printers 
the expiration of these patents range august to march we believe that our patents  in various technologies line matrix  thermal  system architecture  printer control  have competitive value and we intend to continue our practice of enforcing our patent rights against potential infringements where we deem appropriate 
we do not believe the expiration of any of these individual patents will have a significant material impact to our financial condition or results of operations 
although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending our rights to any of our patents  we believe our patents are valid 
despite our best efforts  we may fail to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use 
in addition  our global operations and sales expose us to the risk that other countries may fail to provide the same level of protection for our intellectual property as afforded in the united states 
printronix has no material licenses from others pertaining to the manufacture of products  including those under development  and believe none are currently required 
certain software is obtained under licensing agreements 
we believe  based on industry practice  any such licenses as might be required in the future could be obtained on terms that would not have a material effect on us 
employees printronix had employees as of march   including in the united states  in asia pacific and in europe 
none of our employees in the united states or asia pacific is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
our wholly owned subsidiary  printronix nederland bv  is a member of the employers union fme cwm  and some of our employees have elected to become members of an employee union 
this employee union is not government sponsored and is supported by contributions from its members 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 

table of contents foreign operations we have manufacturing facilities in singapore  wherein line matrix and thermal printer products and some key components are produced 
the singapore facilities also provide product support and customer service for the asia pacific region 
we have a facility in the netherlands that provides product support  customer service  line matrix  thermal and laser printer configuration and distribution 
in april  we began manufacturing line matrix ribbons in mexico for shipment to the americas 
in november  we expanded the manufacture of line matrix ribbons in mexico to include those for export to emea and asia pacific 
we have sales offices within germany  france  the united kingdom  austria  india  korea  china  singapore  mexico and australia 
international sales information is found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
we are not aware of any significant risks with respect to our foreign business other than those inherent in the competitive nature of the business  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other world events 
selected financial information regarding foreign and export sales by geographical area is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
item properties printronix owns a facility measuring approximately  square feet in irvine  california  which houses our us operations  sales support  engineering and development and also is the company headquarters 
the leased facility in memphis  tennessee  is approximately  square feet 
in june  management announced they will close the memphis facility 
we do not expect the closure of this facility to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
related expenditures are expected to be approximately thousand 
foreign operations are located in singapore  the netherlands and mexico 
singapore operations are in a facility owned by printronix  which was constructed in fiscal year and totals approximately  square feet 
the singapore facility is subject to a land lease  which expires in year the netherlands operations are in leased facilities of approximately  square feet 
the lease on the netherlands facilities is an annual lease that is extended from year to year and expires in june the mexico operations are in leased facilities of approximately  square feet 
the lease on the mexico operation expires in september we also lease several small offices  generally on short term leases  throughout the united states  asia pacific and europe for sales  support or service 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for a summary of the expiration dates and lease or rental commitments 
item legal proceedings environmental assessment in january and march  we were notified by the california regional water quality control board santa ana region the board that ground under one of our former production plants and ground adjacent to property previously occupied by us was thought to be contaminated with various chlorinated volatile organic compounds vocs 
evidence adduced from site studies undertaken to date indicates that compounds containing the vocs were not used by printronix during our tenancy  but were used by the prior tenant during its long term occupancy of the site 
in august  we responded to an inquiry from the california department of toxic substance control the department regarding our operations at the site of our former production plant 
in february  the department submitted a proposed corrective action consent agreement to printronix  which would require printronix to perform an investigation of the site which would be used as a basis to determine what  if any  remediation activities would be required of printronix 
we are convinced that we bear no responsibility for any 
table of contents contamination at the sites and we intend to defend vigorously any action that might be brought against us with respect thereto 
as of march  and march   we continued to maintain an accrual for million  included in accrued liabilities other  which we believe is a reasonable estimate to cover any additional expenses related to environmental tests that could be requested by the board 
furthermore  we believe that we have adequately accrued for any future expenditures in connection with environmental matters and that such expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 
legal matters we are involved in various claims and legal matters in the ordinary course of business 
we do not believe these matters will have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition

critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare the consolidated financial statements of printronix in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available to us at the time 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities for the fiscal years presented 
we continuously evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions  including those related to product returns  customer programs and incentives  doubtful accounts  inventories  warranty obligations  intangible assets  other long lived assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the most critical accounting policies used to prepare the accompanying consolidated financial statements are the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with various authoritative guidance including  but not limited to  staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
the application of the authoritative guidance requires judgment to determine whether revenue has been realized or is realizable and earned 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement in the form of a contract or a purchase order  the product has been delivered and title and risk of loss has passed  which generally occurs when the product is shipped  the sales price is fixed or determinable 
table of contents and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our sales are based upon written contractual agreements with our resellers that include established pricing and terms 
our printers contain operating system software  which we consider incidental to the sale of the printer  and no revenue is attributed to the software 
we also sell standard pre packed software to support bar code label printing applications and other software options 
this software does not require customization  nor do we have any post sale obligations 
revenue is recognized as this standard pre packed software is shipped with the printer 
products that are not working properly may be returned subject to our warranty policy discussed below 
customers may return products that are incompatible with the intended application 
judgment is required to record provisions for future product returns 
our business model of configuring products to order for each customer and direct shipping to end users in most cases greatly reduces the amount of inventory in the channel  effectively reduces product return liability and aids in estimating future product returns 
we continuously monitor product returns and  at the time of sale  record a provision as a revenue reduction for the estimated amount of future returns  based upon historical experience  authorization we have granted for significant pending returns and any other known factors 
although such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
because of our direct ship business model  we encourage our channel partners not to hold inventory and  as a result  we do not offer pricing protection for any inventory that is carried by our channel partners 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting returns  or product returns for other reasons  could have a materially adverse impact upon our operating results for the period or periods in which such information is known 
we had no revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables such as the delivery or performance of multiple products  services or rights to use assets that would need to be identified into separate units of accounting 
judgment is also required to record provisions for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing  rebates or other programs 
we record estimated revenue reductions at the time of sale for such programs 
historically  the revenue reductions for these programs have been within our range of estimates  however  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to stay within our range of estimates 
future market conditions may cause us to increase the amount of incentive programs or other programs and could result in additional revenue reductions at that time 
we offer professional services  such as training and customized applications to customers 
these services are generally short term in duration and are billed separately upon completion and acceptance of the service 
although the revenue received from professional services is not currently material  professional services are considered an area of potential growth 
most of our customers arrange their own shipping methods 
for the remaining customers  we record revenue for shipping costs charged 
the related shipping costs incurred are recorded as cost of sales 
we offer printer maintenance services through service agreements that customers may purchase separately from the printer 
these agreements are mostly for a one year period 
we provide the point of customer contact and initial diagnostic services  and supply the parts used for printer repairs 
we have contracted with third parties to perform the on site repair services 
revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of each individual contract  which approximates the manner in which costs are incurred 
any significant change in estimates or circumstances could have a materially adverse impact upon our operating results for the period or periods in which such information is known 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we periodically review all open accounts and provide allowances for specific customer collection issues based upon our estimate of collectibility 
in addition  we maintain general reserves based upon evaluation of our historical losses and overall economic conditions in our industry 

table of contents although bad debt losses historically have been within our expectations and the allowance we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same bad debt loss rates that we have in the past 
any significant change in estimates or circumstances could have a materially adverse impact upon our operating results for the period or periods in which such information is known 
our accounts receivable include substantial receivables from a few large resellers  and a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these resellers  or other significant changes in estimates or circumstances with other customers  could result in an additional allowance that could have a materially adverse effect upon our operating results and financial condition for the period or periods in which such information is known 
inventories inventories include the costs of material  labor and factory overhead 
we record a provision to value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory using the first in  first out method fifo  or the current estimated market value of the inventory  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we periodically review historical sales activity to determine slow moving items and potentially obsolete items and also evaluate the impact of any anticipated changes in future demand  such as the release or potential release of new or modified products  or new competitive products 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimated future demand could prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may experience product shortages  or may only be able to obtain the necessary components at a higher cost 
conversely  an inaccurate estimate of future demand may also result in additional charges for excess and obsolete inventories 
unanticipated changes in demand or changes in technology could have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations and our financial condition for the period or periods in which such information is known 
research and development costs we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements  including statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs and sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
judgment is required in the application of these pronouncements and in determining when technological feasibility is established 
our printers include software  which we consider incidental to the hardware 
our internal research and development costs  which include software development costs  are expensed as incurred 
under our current development methods and procedures  the technological feasibility of the software being developed is not established until substantially all of the product development costs have been incurred 
as a result  we have not capitalized any software development costs for software that is embedded in our products  because the costs incurred after attaining technological feasibility are not material 
warranties we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers  depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
printronix generally offers either a day on site or a month return to factory standard parts and labor warranty on printer and verifier products to most customers 
defective printers and verifiers can be returned to us for repairs or replacement in the applicable warranty period at no cost to the customer 
supplies are warranted for the shelf life of the products  which can be up to two years 
we record a provision for warranty expenses at the time of sale 
we determine the provision for warranty charges by applying the estimated repair cost and estimated return rates to the outstanding units under warranty 
we determine our estimated repair costs by reviewing our historical repair costs and factor in any known or anticipated changes in these costs 
we also evaluate our historical return rate and include the effects of any known or expected future changes in these rates 
we engage in product quality programs and processes  including evaluating our suppliers 
although our warranty costs historically have been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we 
table of contents cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in product failure rates  product return rates  or a significant increase in the cost to repair our products  could have a materially adverse impact upon our operating results and financial condition in the period or periods in which such information is known 
long lived assets long lived assets  including intangible assets  are assessed in accordance with accounting guidance  including  but not limited to  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
judgment is required in the application of the authoritative guidance and in determining the recoverability of assets 
we assess the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets  at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an underlying asset may not be recoverable 
in the event the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  we would record an adjustment to the carrying value of the assets affected based upon a discounted cash flow method 
any major unanticipated change in circumstances could have a significant impact upon the recoverability of long lived assets and upon our operating results and financial condition 
all goodwill and most intangible assets were fully amortized as of march   and the remaining intangible asset related to unpatented technology was fully amortized as of march  income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
we estimate our income tax liability based upon current tax laws in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and those recognized for tax purposes 
judgment is required to determine if deferred tax assets will be realized by examining both the positive and negative evidence available to us  such as historical taxable income or losses  and projected future taxable income or losses 
judgment is also required to determine the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
under sfas no 
 we must place greater reliance on our past history of domestic operating losses than on projected future domestic operating income in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
if the provision for income tax is inadequate  or if we are unable to realize deferred tax assets  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  we could experience income tax charges in excess of the reserves established 
likewise  if the provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  or if we are able to realize additional deferred tax assets  or if tax laws change favorably  we could experience reduced income tax charges 
we have operations in multiple international taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues 
while we believe we have made adequate provision for any such issues  an unfavorable resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
contingencies we account for contingencies in accordance with various accounting guidance  including  but not limited to  sfas no 
accounting for contingencies and financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
judgment is required to evaluate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to reasonably estimate the loss related to legal claims  tax related audits  guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and other known issues  and we will record a charge to earnings if appropriate 
any significant change in estimates or circumstances could have a materially adverse impact upon our operating results for the period or periods in which such information is known 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation issued to employees in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under apb no  compensation is the excess  if any  of the fair market value of the stock at the grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
compensation expense  if any  is recognized over the applicable service period  which is usually the vesting period 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for the fiscal years presented as all options granted under the stock based compensation plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
no stock based compensation has been issued to non employees during the fiscal years presented 
results of operations message from the president a message from the president regarding fiscal year and expectations for fiscal year can be found immediately preceding item of this annual report on form k 
overview of fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenue declined and was negatively impacted by continued economic uncertainty in the americas and european markets  the impact of competing technologies on line matrix product sales  and ibm s conversion to a direct ship method in emea 
ibm s conversion to a direct ship method in emea resulted in a slow down in orders as they worked down their existing inventory and was completed in the fourth fiscal quarter 
we continued to grow our thermal printer sales  which were up over the prior year 
gross margins improved as a result of a stronger euro  lower warranty expenses and lower provision for excess inventory 
we continue to invest a higher than industry average in research and development 
cost control programs reduced general and administrative expenses 
sales and marketing costs increased as we pursued revenue growth through our strategic initiatives that include geographic expansion  demand generation by marketing to the installed base and focused attention on the rapidly emerging opportunities presented by rfid 
cash balances increased by million principally as a result of stock option exercises  asset management programs and results of operations 
expenditures of million were made to buy back company stock 
our focus during the fiscal year was on several growth initiatives  including rfid 
as a result  we were first to market with an rfid printer and began shipments of our smart label developer s kit  in our third fiscal quarter 
we also focused our efforts on geographical expansion by adding additional sales personnel in the emea and asia pacific regions  china in particular  and opened new sales offices in mexico and australia 
lower revenues and higher operating expenses  partially offset by a favorable impact from the euro  all contributed to reduced pre tax income 
overview of fiscal year compared with fiscal year reported improved profitability on lower revenue 
we attribute the revenue decrease partially to the continued softness in the worldwide economy and the related reduced capital spending and partially to the impact of competing technologies on line matrix printer sales 
gross margins improved as a result of a stronger euro and continuing cost reduction programs 
cost control programs maintained relatively flat engineering and general and administrative spending  while continued emphasis on sales and marketing programs  including the major accounts and vertical marketing programs  resulted in higher spending in that area 
overall profitability also improved as a result of higher foreign currency exchange gains as the euro strengthened and also as a result of lower interest expense due to lower interest rates 
cash balances increased by million and inventory decreased by million principally as a result of asset management programs 

table of contents our focus during the fiscal year was on the programs initiated in fiscal year to expand our range of printing solutions in the retail logistics and automotive markets 
also  we continued our emphasis on growth opportunities in the asia pacific region by expanding into korea and by specifically targeting the banking industry in china  where sales were up over the prior year 
we also continued to grow our thermal printer sales  which were up over the prior year  and to expand our major accounts marketing 
revenue fiscal year compared with revenue for the fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with the prior fiscal year 
we attribute the decrease partially to continued economic uncertainty in the americas and european markets which has caused a slow down  or deferral  of customer capital expenditures directly impacting the company s sales in the regions  partially to the impact of competing technologies on line matrix printer sales and partially to a continuing erosion in line matrix sales through oem channels 
in addition  ibm converted to a direct ship method in emea  resulting in a slow down in orders from ibm 
as they worked through this conversion  ibm continued to sell to their customers  however  they did not place replenishment orders with printronix in order to work down their existing inventory 
we estimate the lost revenue due to the conversion to be million 
this process was completed by the end of the fourth fiscal quarter 
the effects of changes in the value of the euro contributed million to revenue 
we increased sales of our thermal products by million  or  as we continue to take market share 
we attribute this increase to our direct marketing efforts 
rfid product sales  although small  are gaining momentum as the industry standards are being finalized 
the decrease in revenue in fiscal year was mainly attributable to unit sale decreases as no major modifications were made to pricing 
sales by geographic region sales by geographic region  related percent changes and percent of total sales for fiscal years and were as follows year ended percent of total sales march  march  percent march  march  change in millions geographic region americas emea asia pacific americas oem sales decreased to million  principally as a result of lower sales to our largest customer  ibm 
the lower sales through ibm were due to their continuing lack of focus on selling line matrix products 
americas distribution sales decreased to million 
americas direct sales decreased to million 
emea oem sales decreased million  or  to million  as a result of ibm s transition to a direct ship method and a one time large sale of million in the prior year 
emea distribution sales were million  up from million a year ago 
emea direct sales were million  down from million a year ago 
changes in the value of the euro contributed million to emea revenue 
asia pacific sales increased from a year ago mostly as a result of growth in the distribution channel  mainly china  thailand and indonesia 
early in the prior fiscal year  sales in the asia pacific region had been negatively impacted by the sars epidemic which significantly slowed trade in the region 

table of contents sales by product technology sales by product technology  related percent changes and percent of total sales for fiscal years and were as follows year ended percent of total sales march  march  percent march  march  change in millions product technology line matrix thermal laser verification products line matrix printer sales were negatively impacted by the effects of competing technologies and lower sales to our largest customer as discussed above 
to stop any further erosion of line matrix product sold through the oem channel  printronix and ibm together have developed a plan for printronix to provide field sales support for ibm and their resellers as well as provide telemarketing to the ibm installed base for demand generation 
we believe the growth in thermal printer sales is a result of our direct marketing to major accounts which resulted in market share growth 
recurring revenue from the installed base was million and of total sales for fiscal year  up from million and of total sales a year ago  partly due to new demand generation programs 
recurring revenue includes line matrix ribbons  laser consumables  spares sales  sales under the advance exchange program  printer maintenance and depot repair services 
we intend to grow our recurring revenue primarily by focusing on marketing to our installed base of customers and adding sales channels to market 
sales by channel sales by channel  related percent changes and percent of total sales for fiscal years and were as follows year ended percent of total sales march  march  percent march  march  change in millions channel oem distribution direct the decrease in oem sales includes a shortfall of million from ibm as a result of lower revenues in the americas and the conversion to direct ship in emea 
it also reflects the large one time sale in emea in the prior year of million 
the growth in the distribution channel was primarily in emea and asia pacific 

table of contents sales by customer sales by customer  related percent changes and percent of total sales for fiscal years and were as follows year ended percent of total sales march  march  percent march  march  change in millions customer largest customer ibm second largest customer top ten customers sales to ibm were lower in emea by million as a result of the conversion to direct ship 
sales to ibm in the americas decreased by million  the fourth year of declines 
as discussed in the message from the president immediately preceding item of this annual report on form k  we are actively taking steps to stop the revenue declines with ibm by providing field sales support and demand generation activities 
revenue from united states customers was and of total revenue  while revenue from international customers was and of total revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect international revenue to grow and continue to be a large percentage of total revenue 
revenue fiscal year compared with revenue for the fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with the prior fiscal year 
we attribute the decrease partially to continued softness in the worldwide economy and the continued slowdown in capital spending for plant expansion or refurbishment and partially to the impact of competing technologies on line matrix printer sales 
since fiscal year  we have experienced decreasing volumes of line matrix printer sales 
in addition  there was a heavy investment in it infrastructure in the years leading up to the year yk  and we believe orders slowed as the supply chain needed time to work through the conversions and upgrades 
we also were impacted by lower sales to our major customer 
thermal printer sales increased over the prior fiscal year  due to our major accounts and vertical marketing programs 
the effects of changes in the euro s value in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  resulted in an increase in revenue of million 
sales by geographic region sales by geographic region  related percent changes and percent of total sales for fiscal years and were as follows year ended percent of total sales march  march  percent march  march  change in millions geographic region americas emea asia pacific americas oem sales decreased to million  principally as a result of lower sales to our largest customer

increased sales in the retail logistics market as a result of our direct marketing were more than offset by lower sales elsewhere 
americas direct sales increased to million 
emea oem sales decreased million  or  to million  principally as a result of lower sales to our largest customer 
emea distribution sales were million  up 
table of contents from million a year ago  due to our direct marketing programs 
emea direct sales were million  up from million a year ago 
asia pacific sales increased million  or  from a year ago to million  mostly as a result of increased line matrix sales through the distribution channel into the banking industry in china  where sales were up over the prior year

table of contents gross margin fiscal year compared with gross margin as a percentage of sales was in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year and increased due to the strengthening of the euro  lower warranty expenses  lower provision for excess inventory  and continuing cost reduction programs partially offset by lower volume 
the changes in the value of the euro added million  or basis points  to the gross margin in fiscal year warranty expenses decreased by million due to a decrease in the outstanding units under warranty 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory decreased by million due to asset management programs 
fiscal year compared with gross margin as a percentage of sales was in fiscal year and in fiscal year the increase in gross margin is primarily due to the strengthening of the euro which added million  or basis points  and continuing cost reductions  both of which were partially offset by lower volumes 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of engineering and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative costs 
operating expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we believe it is critical to continue to invest in research and development to ensure technology leadership in line matrix  thermal and rfid printing solutions 
engineering expenses consist mostly of labor and test materials 
in fiscal year  we spent million on engineering and development  compared with million in fiscal year and million for fiscal year as a percentage of revenue  engineering and development expenses increased in fiscal year to from in fiscal year and in fiscal year  mostly as a result of lower revenue in fiscal years and in fiscal year  engineering and development costs were focused on a three pronged strategy introduce new products to open new markets  broaden product lines within existing markets  and enhance existing products to support regional expansion in the asian markets 
the most significant change from prior years was a strategic shift to develop a new line of thermal printers to support wal mart and the dod s rfid initiatives 
in addition  the t thermal family was further enhanced to add additional data stream interpreters to work in tec  intermec and sato applications  plus a general purpose interface was released to support a broad base of post processing external devices  including print and apply applicators 
to address the market need for industrial grade transaction printing  a zero tear version of the p line matrix pedestal printer was developed and launched late fiscal to facilitate regional expansion  the p line sold into asian markets received a new high speed controller coupled with regional specific enhancements for both distribution and oem version printers 
in fiscal year  expenditures were made to bring to market a wireless feature option for the thermal and line matrix printers 
in addition  expenditures were made to develop a lpm line matrix printer  the pd  and to develop the ps  a lpm line matrix printer which uses a single hammer bank instead of a double hammer bank 
the pd is the world s fastest line matrix printer  printing lines per minute using a double hammer bank 
in fiscal year  expenditures were made to enhance the line matrix product family with a faster printer  resulting in the introduction of the pd during fiscal year sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year increased to million  compared with million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased to from in fiscal year and in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal year from the prior fiscal year due to increased spending for marketing programs  including the creation of a telesales program to market to the installed base in the united states and geographic expansion 
new sales offices were opened in australia  mexico  and china and additional sales resources were added in europe  resulting in additional sales compensation and facilities costs 
in addition  incremental expenditures of approximately million were made during the fourth quarter for rfid 
table of contents marketing program initiatives 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal years and was due to higher labor and marketing costs due to increased resources being applied to the major accounts and vertical marketing programs 
general and administrative spending for fiscal year was million compared with million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year general and administrative expenses decreased during fiscal year from the prior fiscal year due to lower labor costs  lower provision for doubtful accounts due to resolution of an outstanding customer collection issue during the fourth quarter  and lower amortization of intangibles  partially offset by increased consulting costs for sarbanes oxley compliance and the research and development tax credit study 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal year from the prior fiscal year due to lower labor costs  lower provision for doubtful accounts and lower amortization of intangibles 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  principally as a result of lower revenues 
general and administrative expenses were of revenue in fiscal year the effects of changes in the value of the euro resulted in increases in operating expenses of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
foreign currency losses gains  net foreign currency transactions and remeasurements were losses of thousand in fiscal year compared with gains of thousand in fiscal year and losses of thousand in fiscal year  principally due to the effect of changes in the value of the euro 
the future effect of changes in the value of the euro or other foreign currencies upon our results of operations or financial condition is difficult to predict 
a summary of the effects of the changes in the value of the euro can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
interest and other expenses  net interest and other expenses  net  increased million in fiscal year due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower rates  and lower other income

we expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year to be between and 
we project to return to profitable domestic operating income 
in addition  we believe our singapore income taxes will increase as a result of the expiration of the pioneer status 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company completed a federal income tax audit 
the audit resulted in a net zero charge to earnings  however  a one time additional million of income was assessed to the united states operations from foreign operations 
without this additional assessment  the united states would have reported losses of million 
under sfas no 
 we must place greater reliance on our history of cumulative united states operating losses than on our future projections which indicate operating income in the united states 
as a result of cumulative united states losses and the full 
table of contents utilization of our loss carryback potential  we concluded that an increase in our valuation allowance was appropriate 
the tax provision for fiscal year reflects the tax expense of our foreign operations which are at a lower rate than the united states  and a valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards and certain other credits generated in the united states  mostly offset by the research and development tax credit claimed in the united states 
the tax provision for fiscal years and reflects the effects of net operating losses and lower income tax rates in countries in which we operate 
we had a favorable pioneer tax status that began in april in singapore for income generated from the manufacture and sale of the printronix p series line matrix products by our singapore subsidiary 
net income generated by our singapore subsidiary was exempt from tax liability 
the pioneer status ended march  the pioneer status mandated that we meet certain requirements  including meeting specific levels of capital investment and engineering headcount 
the pioneer status reduced foreign taxes by million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the diluted net income per share effect of this pioneer status was an increase of cents  cents and cents for fiscal years  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources overview the primary source of liquidity historically has been cash generated from operations  which was million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash generated from operations has been sufficient to allow the company to fund its working capital needs  invest in capital expenditures as needed  and repurchase shares of its common stock during the fiscal periods presented 
credit facilities a subsidiary of the company maintains an unsecured line of credit with a foreign bank for million 
the company also maintains a credit agreement in the amount of million with a foreign bank to support our hedging activities 
in december  the company obtained a standby letter of credit for million in conjunction with our workers compensation insurance program 
during and as of the periods presented  no amounts were borrowed under these agreements 
the company also has a credit facility with a united states bank for million secured by a long term note on our irvine facility 
this note has scheduled principal repayments of million annually through fiscal year and a balloon payment of million in fiscal year see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
fiscal year compared with cash and cash equivalents increased million to million in fiscal year we generated million in cash from operations  which was lower than the million generated from operations a year ago principally as a result of decreased profitability and lower cash provided by inventory and other assets 
in fiscal year  cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million  significantly higher than the prior fiscal year proceeds of million as large blocks of options were exercised shortly before they were scheduled to expire 
investment in property  plant and equipment was less than depreciation expense 
the remaining major uses of cash were payments totaling million made on the long term note and repurchases of stock totaling million 
we ended fiscal year with debt of million related to the long term note  which consisted of million long term and million for the current portion of the long term debt 
the remaining shares that could be repurchased at the discretion of management under the stock buyback program totaled  shares as of march  
table of contents we believe our internally generated funds are sufficient to finance anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
should we need to obtain additional sources of funds  we believe we could obtain such funds through additional credit facilities 
fiscal year compared with cash and cash equivalents increased million to million in fiscal year  principally due to increased profitability and a reduction in inventory levels 
we generated million in cash from operations  which was lower than the million generated from operations in the prior fiscal year as a result of a slowing in the rate of decrease in inventory and an increase in accounts receivables 
investment in property  plant and equipment was less than depreciation expense

guarantees the parent company guarantees any amounts outstanding on the subsidiary s unsecured line of credit with a foreign bank for million 
there were no cash borrowings against this line of credit for the fiscal periods presented 
in connection with the standby letter of credit agreement obtained for our workers compensation insurance program  we have agreed to indemnify the bank from any third party claims related to its performance on our behalf 
we believe the fair value of this indemnification agreement is minimal and have not recorded a liability for it 
in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products  the company may indemnify customers and hold them harmless against losses arising from intellectual property infringement claims 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is unlimited 
we have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal and have not recorded a liability for these agreements 
the company has also agreed to hold harmless a former officer of the company in the event of an unfavorable outcome of ongoing litigation 
we believe the fair value of the resolution of this litigation is minimal and have not recorded a liability for it

the information contained below should be carefully considered when reviewing any forward looking statements contained in this document 

table of contents we operate in an industry influenced by worldwide capital spending 
our products are used for mission critical applications in industrial settings such as manufacturing plants and distribution centers and in information technology and back office operations 
our revenue is impacted by the worldwide level of spending for capital expenditures related to manufacturing plant expansion or refurbishment 
in addition  our revenue is impacted by growth in the level of activity in the worldwide supply chain 
the slowness in the worldwide economy and the resultant reduced capital expenditures for plant expansion and refurbishment has contributed to revenue reductions noted since fiscal year continued softness in the global economy could result in lower revenue and could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in an industry affected by competing technologies 
the industrial printing market utilizes varying technologies including line matrix  thermal transfer  laser  inkjet  serial and band printing technologies 
across all technologies  the printers are characterized as high  medium or low end depending upon their range of features  including functionality and durability 
products made by printronix utilize line matrix  thermal transfer high end and high end laser printing technologies 
since fiscal year  we have experienced decreasing volumes of line matrix printer sales 
this is partially due to the heavy spending on information technology systems replacements and upgrades related to yk in the fiscal years leading up to the year  partially due to the impact of other competing technologies  in particular thermal printers and mid range laser printers  and partially due to a loss of focus on selling our products by our largest customer in the oem channel 
during fiscal year  we have taken steps to mitigate the impact that competing technologies have had upon our product sales 
together with our largest customer  we have developed a plan for printronix to provide field sales support for ibm and their resellers as well as provide telemarketing to the ibm installed base for demand generation 
we continued to implement our plan of geographic expansion of sales offices in markets where line matrix is growing 
we will also continue to develop higher speed line matrix printers that will allow us to replace aging band printers and compete against the mid range laser printers 
we cannot offer assurance that we can successfully develop the needed products and compete against current competitors or future competitors for band printers and mid range laser printers  or regain mindshare with our largest customer 
we operate in an industry characterized by technological change 
the printing solutions industry is extremely competitive and is characterized by technological change  frequent new product development  periodic product obsolescence  evolving industry standards  changing information technologies and evolving distribution channels 
we must adapt quickly to changing technological  application and solutions needs  and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
we could incur substantial cost to keep pace with the technological changes  and may not be able to adapt to these changes 
although we believe that we currently compete favorably with respect to these characteristics  this may change in the future 
our future success largely depends upon our ability to continuously develop new products  services and solutions 
to develop new products  we invest in research and development 
in spite of our efforts  we may fail to develop new products 
additionally  the new products we develop may not achieve market acceptance or may not be manufactured at competitive costs or in sufficient volumes 
we cannot guarantee the success of our research and development efforts 
the industry activity related to rfid smart labels has continued to build momentum to meet the january start date mandated by wal mart and the dod for their top tier suppliers 
we must adapt quickly to changes mandated by the industry standard setting group  epc global  to achieve market share in this growing opportunity 
our failure to enhance our existing products  services and solutions or to develop and introduce new products  services and solutions that meet changing customer requirements and evolving technological standards would adversely impact our ability to sell our products 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive market 
the market for medium and high speed computer printers and the related post sale supplies is highly competitive  subject to change  and is likely to become even more competitive 
we compete directly with several companies of various sizes  including some of the largest businesses in the united states and japan 
our competitors include privately held companies  publicly held companies and subsidiaries of multinational corporations 
some of our competitors may enter into strategic business relationships with other companies 
our current main competitors in line matrix printers are tally genicom and hitachi data systems 
our current main competitors in high end thermal printers are zebra technologies corporation zebra nasdaq zbra  toshiba corporation tec  sato  and intermec nyse una 
we cannot offer assurance that we can successfully compete against these current competitors or future competitors 
some competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  sales  marketing and other resources than we do and have achieved greater name recognition for their products and technologies than we have 
we may not be able to successfully increase our market penetration or our overall share of the printer market 
we can offer no assurance that products with superior market acceptance  superior price or superior performance will not be introduced by our competitors 
increased competition may result in price reductions  lower gross margins  loss of market share and could require increased investment in inventory  research and development  sales expenses  marketing programs and expenditures to expand channels to market 
the company may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain current product cost reductions  or achieve future product cost reductions  including warranty costs 
customers may defer their purchasing decisions in anticipation of the introduction of new products or the actual introduction of new products by the company or its competitors 
if we fail to address our competitive challenges  there could be a materially adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we compete in the rapidly evolving market for rfid for the supply chain 
standards for the emerging rfid market are evolving almost daily 
uhf frequency standards have been set for the united states and europe  but not yet for the rest of the world 
the design of the microchip used in rfid smart labels is also evolving as the industry moves forward 
currently  three classes of chips are available  class  class  and class epc standards committee is currently driving the design of a second generation chip that will become the standard going forward 
we cannot guarantee that we can successfully meet the evolving standards in the future or evolving product designs 
we were first to market a product that meets the needs of the rfid mandate from wal mart and the dod with a smart label 
we believe our primary competition in rfid printing is zebra for the consumer products market and intermec for the dod requirements and we believe they are actively pursuing this market 
we cannot offer assurances that we can successfully compete against these competitors or other competitors in the rfid market 
we believe the opportunity presented by rfid draws heavily upon our differentiating features such as odv  open systems architecture to fit seamlessly into legacy it applications and global presence  but can offer no assurance that we will be successful in capturing market share in this new market or be successful in improving our profitability as a result of capturing market share 
we have entered into several key strategic alliances with the leaders in rfid labels  software and integration services 
we cannot guarantee that these strategic alliances will be successful 

table of contents we sell a large portion of our products to a small number of resellers oems and distributors and we expect this will continue 
we rely upon a few resellers for a significant amount of our revenue 
in fiscal years and  sales to our largest reseller  ibm  represented and of net sales  respectively  and sales to our second largest reseller represented and of net sales  respectively 
sales to the top ten customers represented of net sales in fiscal year and of net sales in fiscal year the loss of any one of these resellers would have a materially adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also may be adversely impacted by any conflicts that could arise between and among our sales channels 
we believe our future success depends upon our ability to provide industrial strength printing solutions to a broader customer base and to maintain good relationships with our major oems and distributors 
we believe continued purchase of our products by oems is dependent upon many factors  including oems desire to use outside suppliers rather than investing the capital resources necessary to develop their own products 
our dependence upon a small number of major resellers exposes us to numerous risks  including loss of channel  customers leveraging their buying power to change the terms of pricing  payment and product delivery schedules  and direct competition should a customer decide to manufacture printers internally 
we cannot guarantee a major reseller will not reduce  delay or eliminate purchases from us  which could have a materially adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in an environment of unpredictable demand 
we rely upon our ability to successfully forecast customer demand and to manage our worldwide inventory levels to support this demand in a cost effective manner 
our sales to resellers are made under purchase orders that typically have short delivery requirements 
although we receive periodic order forecasts from our major reseller  they have no obligation to purchase the forecasted amounts and may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice 
significant increases in demand could result in inventory shortages  higher costs to obtain expedited materials and components  and or lost revenue opportunities 
significant decreases in demand could result in increased inventory levels  higher production costs  higher material and component procurement costs and reduced profitability 
we have taken several actions over the years to mitigate these risks 
we utilize just in time jit practices wherever possible in our manufacturing process to minimize the potential for excess and obsolete inventories 
we maintain minimal levels of finished good printer products since we build to order 
we are able to achieve the many optional configurations customers choose to meet their needs by combining the elements of a printer that are common across all printers  called a variant  with the unique combination of options a customer chooses to achieve their needed connectivity and features 
the use of variants greatly reduces our need to maintain inventory levels and offers maximum flexibility to meet customer demands 
we cannot guarantee that our results of operations and financial condition will not be adversely affected in the future by such changes in demand 
we rely upon worldwide suppliers 
our products are manufactured using raw materials and components that are acquired in the united states and from sources around the world 
we use a large number of suppliers and regularly evaluate the availability of potential alternate suppliers should circumstances change with existing suppliers 
we internally develop most of the software used in our printer products 
certain software is purchased from suppliers through royalty agreements 
if we were to experience a sudden loss of availability of purchased raw materials and components or purchased software  we are unable to guarantee that we could quickly obtain the needed 
table of contents items from alternate sources 
our ability to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely  cost effective manner could be adversely affected  thus affecting our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely upon our international facilities 
we rely heavily upon our international facilities to manufacture key products  components and complete configuration of printers 
our future operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by several factors  including  but not limited to  failure of our international production and configuration facilities or international suppliers to supply products reliably  disruptions in international trade  or production and supply constraints that could result in additional costs 
also  we rely upon our ability to successfully predict demand and to adjust our worldwide inventories accordingly 
we have international customers  operations and suppliers 
for fiscal years   and  international revenue excluding united states sales accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our net sales 
we expect international revenue will continue to grow and account for a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
there are many risks associated with international customers  operations and suppliers  including  but not limited to  the following compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulations  including export requirements  tariffs  import duties  health and safety requirements and other barriers  differences in intellectual property protections  currency fluctuations  economic instability  including inflation and interest rate fluctuations  risk of loss of our international assets due to political or economic instability  competition from foreign suppliers  political or civil turmoil  war or conflict abroad  terrorist attacks and outbreaks of infectious disease such as severe accute respiratory syndrome sars 
the company s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by overlapping or differing tax structures  whether we obtain an extension of the singapore pioneer tax status which expired at the end of fiscal year and which exempted earnings from the manufacture and sale of the line matrix p products by our singapore subsidiary from income tax  a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing income tax rates and unfavorable outcomes of future audits by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions 
failure to manage the risks posed by our international customers  operations and suppliers could have a materially adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
the ability to attract and to retain key  highly qualified personnel  both technical and managerial  is critical to our success 

table of contents developing  manufacturing and marketing our products is a complex process and requires significant expertise to meet customers specifications 
competition for personnel  particularly qualified engineers  is keen 
the loss of a significant number of key personnel  as well as the failure to recruit and train additional key personnel in a timely manner could have a materially adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our intellectual property is important to our success 
we rely upon patents to protect our intellectual property 
we execute confidentiality and non disclosure agreements as needed and limit access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information  however  we cannot guarantee that our efforts to protect our intellectual property will be successful 
we have been granted a total of united states and foreign patents 
our ability to compete successfully and to achieve future revenue growth depends  in part  upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and to operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we may fail to do so 
such infringement claims  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
a third party claiming infringement also may obtain an injunction or other equitable relief  which effectively could block the distribution or sale of allegedly infringing products 
the departure of any of our key management and technical personnel  or breach of non disclosure obligations  or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a materially adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our singapore and european operations may be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
we are not aware of any significant risks with respect to our foreign business other than those inherent in the competitive nature of the business and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses were thousand for fiscal year  compared with gains of thousand for fiscal year and losses of thousand for fiscal year  principally due to the effect of changes in the value of the euro 
the future effect of changes in the value of the euro or other foreign currencies on our results of operations or financial condition is difficult to predict 
we employ a foreign currency hedging program in order to mitigate exposure to foreign currency rate movements 
information on our foreign currency hedging program is found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
the effects of changes in the euro s value in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  were as follows an increase in revenue of million  an increase in gross margin of million  an increase in operating expenses of million and an increase in foreign exchange losses of million 
the effects of changes in the euro s value in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  were as follows an increase in revenue of million  an increase in gross margin of million  an increase in operating expenses of million and an increase in foreign exchange gains of million 
interest rate risk we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally debt obligations and short term cash investments 
borrowings are at variable rates for periods that generally do not exceed days 
information about our bank borrowings is found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k
