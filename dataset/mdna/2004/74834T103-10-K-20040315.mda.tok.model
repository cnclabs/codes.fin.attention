item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion about costs associated with this move 
item legal proceedings on july   computer associates international  inc ca filed a complaint against us and four of our employees in the us district court for the northern district of illinois alleging copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation in connection with the development of the database administration component of our quest central for db product and seeking injunctive relief and unspecified money damages 
the complaint was amended in may to add another quest employee as a defendant and to assert breach of contract claims against three of the individual defendants 
in october  ca filed a motion for preliminary injunction 
we responded to this motion in january  arguing that ca cannot meet the requirements for injunctive relief 
in connection with our response  we sought leave to assert a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment of invalidity of ca s copyright registrations 
rulings on these motions are not expected until late in the second quarter of if ca s motion is granted  we would be preliminarily enjoined from licensing quest central for db we are vigorously defending ca s claims and do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
after we announced on july  that we would restate certain financial results as a result of our discovery of a computational error relating to an error in the method used to translate foreign currency denominated accounts into us dollars at historical rates  numerous separate complaints purporting to be class actions were filed in the united states district court for the central district of california alleging that we and some of our officers and directors violated provisions of the securities exchange act of orders designating a lead plaintiff and consolidating the federal class action complaints were issued by the u 
s 
district court in late october  and an amended consolidated class action complaint was filed in january the consolidated amended complaint contains varying allegations  including allegations that we made materially false and misleading statements with respect to our financial results for and the quarter ended march  included in our filings with the sec and press releases 
in addition  one complaint purporting to be a derivative action has been filed in california state court against some of our directors and officers 
this complaint is based on the same facts and circumstances described in the consolidated amended class action complaints and generally alleges that the named directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties by failing to oversee adequately our financial reporting 
each of the complaints generally seek an unspecified amount of damages 
the cases are in the very preliminary stages and we will vigorously defend these claims  however  it is not possible for us to quantify the extent of our potential liability  if any 
accordingly  no amounts have been accrued in the accompanying financial statements 
our motions to dismiss the federal class action complaint and the derivative action are expected to be filed during the second quarter of an unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition  defending any litigation may be costly and divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business 
we are a party to other litigation  which we consider to be routine and incidental to our business 
management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in the normal course of our business  we enter into certain types of agreements that require us to indemnify or guarantee the obligations of other parties 
these commitments include i intellectual property indemnities to licensees of our software products  ii indemnities to certain lessors under office space leases for certain claims arising from our use or occupancy of the related premises  or for the obligations of our subsidiaries under leasing arrangements  iii indemnities to customers  vendors and service providers for claims based on negligence or willful misconduct of our employees and agents  and iv indemnities to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law 
the terms and duration of these commitments varies and  in 
table of contents some cases  may be indefinite  and certain of these commitments do not limit the maximum amount of future payments we could become obligated to make thereunder  accordingly  our actual aggregate maximum exposure related to these types of commitments cannot be reasonably estimated 
historically  we have not been obligated to make significant payments for obligations of this nature  and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the fair value of these obligations issued during the twelve months ended december  was not significant to our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

finally  our historic results should not be viewed as indicative of future performance 
overview and business model we are an independent software vendor of a broad portfolio of products that improve information technology operations 
we focus our efforts on products for widely adopted software platforms such as the oracle  ibm db and microsoft sql server database management systems  the packaged applications provided by companies such as sap  oracle  peoplesoft and siebel and the microsoft active directory and exchange systems 
products for the oracle databases have traditionally been our core product set 
over the last three years  the revenue contribution from oracle database only products has declined as a percentage of total revenues because of reduced revenues from our high availability products for oracle and because of our efforts to build and acquire products outside of the oracle database market  especially in the areas of application performance management and microsoft infrastructure management 
additional information about our products can be found under the discussion above under the heading business 
our revenue consists primarily of software license fees and maintenance fees from customers 
our software licensing model is primarily based on perpetual license fees  and our license fees are calculated either on a per server basis or  for our sql and jee development  report management and microsoft administration tools  a per user basis 
first year maintenance contracts are typically sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
maintenance services entitle a customer to technical support via telephone and the internet and unspecified maintenance releases  updates and enhancements 
maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months 
we also provide consulting and training services  which relate to installation of our products and do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
consulting and training service revenues are recognized as the services are performed and represent approximately of total services revenues 
our total revenues increased from to and increased from to as discussed below  license revenues increased from to after decreasing from to services revenues increased from to and increased from to total revenues benefited in both and from the depreciation of the us dollar against the euro and british pound 
total revenues also benefited in and  to a lesser extent  in  from the revenue contribution by sitraka  inc  which we acquired in november revenue contributions from foreign currency translation benefits and sitraka are quantified in the discussions headed revenues below 
our primary expenses are our personnel costs  which include compensation and benefits and costs of office facilities and travel and entertainment  which are a function of our world wide headcount 
this is reflected in our gross margins that ranged between and in and and in our estimate that these personnel 
table of contents related costs represented approximately of total expenses in we have held our headcount fairly constant throughout and  with the exceptions that the sitraka acquisition in november added approximately personnel and that we reduced headcount by to in the june and september quarters of this reduction in headcount and higher revenues have resulted in improved operating margins in the second half of we did not record any restructuring charges in connection with this headcount reduction 
acquisitions in january  we signed a definitive agreement to acquire aelita software  a privately held software vendor  in a million cash transaction 
aelita develops  markets and supports products that improve the productivity  system availability and security of microsoft active directory and microsoft exchange environments 
with the proposed acquisition of aelita  we expect to add breadth and depth to our microsoft expertise and product portfolio and deliver a comprehensive set of product solutions that enable customers to manage today s complex microsoft infrastructures throughout their entire lifecycle 
we expect to complete the acquisition of aelita in the first quarter of in november of  we acquired sitraka  a leading developer of application server performance management products  and broadened our application performance management portfolio of products to enable customers to detect  diagnose and resolve application bottlenecks within multi tiered java application environments 
results of operations from sitraka and other acquisitions are included in our consolidated statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition

we saw growth year over year primarily in our application performance management products  with foglight being the main contributor to the growth 
license revenues were reduced by declines in sales of our high availability products for oracle and our vista output management products 
service revenues total service revenues growth of derived from service revenues growth of in north america  which increased to million and service revenues growth of outside of north america to million in higher revenues from support renewals primarily contributed to the growth  with an increasing base of products and customers we are supporting and  we believe  higher support renewal rates 
service revenues also benefited from a contribution of approximately million from the impact of the devaluation of the us dollar in relative to certain foreign currencies  primarily the euro and the british pound and  to a much lesser extent  support revenues from the acquired base of sitraka customers

cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues was for  compared with in we expect that cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues will remain relatively constant in cost of services cost of services primarily consists of personnel  outside consultants  facilities and systems costs used in providing support  consulting and training services 
cost of services as a percentage of service revenues declined to for  compared to for the increase in the absolute amounts of cost of services is primarily due to an increase in fees paid to outside professional services consultants in 
table of contents support of product deployments  an increase in the number of technical support personnel and consultants  mainly from the acquisition of sitraka  as well as the impact from the devaluation of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies  primarily the euro and the british pound 
the margin improvement is primarily due to our continued increase in customer maintenance and support revenues with a lower associated increase in headcount 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets includes amortization of the fair value of acquired technology associated with the acquisitions made from through the increase is primarily due to amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the acquisitions of ecritical and discus in the second quarter of and sitraka in  offset slightly by purchased intangible assets from acquisitions made in that were fully amortized by the beginning and middle of the year ended december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of estimated future amortization expense 
the useful lives of the acquired technologies range from two to seven years

operating expenses year over year changes in the principal components of our operating expenses are as follows in thousands  except for percentages percentage change operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the following types of costs related to our sales and marketing activities compensation and benefits  sales commissions  facilities and systems  recruiting  trade shows  travel and entertainment  and marketing communications 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in compared to in the absolute increase in sales and marketing expenses resulted from increased labor expenses  primarily due to additional headcount from our acquisition of sitraka  higher salary and commission rate in and to the us dollar devaluation 
in addition  employee severance costs contributed approximately million to sales and marketing expenses in these increases were offset somewhat by lower marketing program costs in  primarily related to advertising and tradeshows 
sales and marketing expenses declined year over year on a percentage of revenues basis because of lower marketing costs in and reduced sales headcount in the third and fourth quarters of research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs for software developers  software product managers  quality assurance and technical documentation personnel  associated facilities and systems costs and payments made to outside software development consultants in connection with our ongoing efforts to enhance our core technologies and develop additional products 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in compared to in additional headcount from our acquisition of sitraka was the primary reason for the absolute increase in research and development expenses 
the devaluation of the us dollar to the australian and canadian dollars also contributed to the expense increase  because we have significant development facilities in australia and canada 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs for our executive  finance  legal  administrative and information services personnel  professional fees  and associated facilities and systems costs 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total 
table of contents revenues were in and in the absolute increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the inclusion of sitraka s general and administrative expenses  the currency effect of the us dollar devaluation  and higher accounting and legal fees 
external accounting and legal fees alone increased by approximately million in compared to  with litigation defense costs and sarbanes oxley compliance costs being the primary components 
amortization of purchased intangible assets intangible asset amortization includes the amortization of customer lists  trademarks and non compete agreements associated with acquisitions 
the increase in amortization is a result of the recent acquisitions  including sitraka 
other income  net other income  net includes interest income on our investment portfolio and gains and losses from foreign exchange fluctuations  as well as gains or losses on other financial or physical assets 
interest income decreased from million in to million in as a result of lower reinvestment rates and a reduced investment portfolio on average 
foreign currency gains of million were included in other income  net in as compared to million of such gains included in the gains were primarily attributable to foreign currency fluctuations on certain non us dollar denominated assets  primarily accounts receivable held in british pounds and euros  which appreciated and  respectively  against the us dollar in other income  net in also includes an impairment charge of million incurred in the fourth quarter of relating to our aircraft 
the impairment charge is equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the aircraft 
income tax provision provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in  representing an increase of million or 
the effective income tax rate in was compared to in the decline in the effective tax rate is largely the result of higher profitability of certain of our non us subsidiaries  which are subject to a lower effective tax rate primarily as a result of the utilization of historical net operating losses incurred in such jurisdictions 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and revenues total revenues and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except for percentages percentage change revenues licenses services total revenues license revenues we believe customer efforts to reduce it spending in response to general economic conditions contributed to the decrease in license revenues in in addition  we experienced increased competition related to our high availability and production support products for oracle and our vista output management products  which also contributed to the decline in license revenues 
the decline in license revenues for these products was offset by growth in other product areas  primarily our microsoft administration products and our monitoring products 
license revenues in north america decreased to million in from million in  a decline of 
license revenues outside of north america increased to million in from million in  and accounted for of total license revenues  compared to 
table of contents in the increase in license revenues outside of north america is primarily due to strengthening operations in europe as a result of continued investment in our foreign operations 
license revenues attributable to our european operations represented million in  compared to million in  representing growth of 
service revenues the increase in service revenues was derived primarily from higher renewal maintenance fees 
higher renewal maintenance fees derived from growth in the base of installed products and  we believe  from improved support renewal billing processes and improved maintenance renewal rates 
to a much lesser extent  support revenues from the acquired base of sitraka customers also contributed to year over year increase in service revenues 
professional services as a percentage of total service revenues represented in and in cost of revenues total cost of revenues and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except for percentages percentage change cost of revenues licenses services amortization of purchased intangible assets total cost of revenues cost of licenses cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues was for  compared with in the decrease in cost of licenses for was primarily due to a decrease in third party royalty obligations associated with our acquisition of revealnet in the third quarter of  whose products we distributed  and a decrease in amortization expense related to rights in purchased software rights 
cost of services cost of services as a percentage of service revenues declined to for  compared to for the decrease in cost of services for is primarily attributable to a reduction in the amount of fees paid to outside consultants who provided specialized professional services

research and development research and development expenses declined as a percentage of total revenues to in from in in  we implemented cost control measures that resulted in decreases in travel expenses and fees paid to outside software development consultants 
these savings were offset by increased labor costs primarily attributable to the additional headcount resulting from the sitraka acquisition 
general and administrative the increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily attributable to increased legal expenses and premiums for directors and officers liability insurance coverage 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively flat from to intangible asset and goodwill amortization the decrease in intangible asset and goodwill amortization was principally due to our adoption of sfas no

in february  we entered into an agreement to purchase a building in aliso viejo  california comprising approximately  square feet for approximately million  and an agreement to lease approximately  square feet of space in an adjacent building for a ten year term commencing in december the purchase of this building is expected to close at the end of the first quarter of the lease agreement includes an option  exercisable until november   to purchase this building 
if we exercise this option  the purchase price would be approximately million 
we intend to move all of our irvine operations into these two buildings in stages over the next six quarters 
the cost of improvements and moving to a new location is expected to be approximately million for each building 
on january   we signed a definitive agreement to acquire aelita software corporation in a transaction valued at approximately million  of which approximately million is expected to be paid to aelita s stockholders in cash upon closing of this transaction assuming no unanticipated exercise of existing aelita stock options prior to closing 
this transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of in the future  we expect cash will continue to be generated from our operations 
we plan to reinvest our cash generated from operations in new short and long term marketable securities consistent with past investment practices and continue to evaluate a variety of other strategic investment and acquisition opportunities 
financing activities financing activities generated million in  primarily from net proceeds of million from issuances of our common stock under employee stock option and stock purchase plans  offset by the use of million to repay debt 
financing activities generated million in  of which million was generated from issuances of our common stock under employee stock option and stock purchase plans  offset by the use of million to repay debt 
in december  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may purchase up to two million shares of our common stock 
under the repurchase program  we may purchase shares from time to time at varying prices in open market or private transactions 
in october  our board of directors increased the total number of shares authorized for repurchase under the stock repurchase program from two million shares to five million 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
repurchases help offset dilution from stock issued under our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
no shares of common stock were repurchased under this plan during or contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations or commercial commitments include our facility lease commitments and operating leases for office facilities and certain items of equipment as well as the remaining 
table of contents balance of million for certain indebtedness assumed in connection with our acquisition of fastlane in september  which is due in july of in addition  we are committed to pay additional capital contributions to a private equity fund totaling million as capital calls are made

based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
if we are not able to generate or sustain positive cash flow from operations  we would be required to use existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances to support our working capital 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to substantial risks described below under the caption risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  intangible assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from two primary sources software licenses and services  which include post contract customer support  consulting and education 
we utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products and services are sold to our customers 
we license our products primarily through our direct sales force and indirectly through resellers 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and related interpretations  sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue 
table of contents recognition in financial statements  and other related pronouncements 
based on our reading and interpretation of sop  sop  sab and other related pronouncements  we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
the aicpa and its software revenue recognition task force continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our software products are off the shelf products that do not require modification or customization 
revenues from sales to of software licenses to customers are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we consider a written contract  signed by both the customer and us  to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred we deem delivery to have occurred when all products or services that are essential to the functionality are delivered to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable we deem our fee to be fixed or determinable when we have a signed contract that states the agreed upon fee for our software and or services 
we consider arrangements with or more of the payments due within six months and the balance due within the next six months to be fixed and determinable 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these customary payment terms are considered neither to be fixed nor determinable  and revenue from such arrangements is recognized as payments are received 
we do not grant customers a right of return  and collection is probable we assess the probability of collection on a customer by customer basis  based on the customer s payment history and our evaluation of the customer s financial position 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we recognize revenue upon receipt of payment 
our software license sales include an implicit first year annual customer support fee  which is recognized ratably over the one year term of the arrangement 
a customer s renewal of annual customer support is priced as a percentage of the net software license fees  generally to of the initial purchase price 
we also offer product implementation and training services  which are sold separately under consulting engagement contracts 
revenues from these arrangements are accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop and are recognized as the services are performed 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined in reliance on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
vsoe of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately 
when multiple elements are sold to a customer in a single contract  the revenues from such multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element based upon the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized for all delivered elements when there is vsoe of the fair values of all undelivered elements and all revenue recognition criteria of sop  as amended  are satisfied 
under the residual method of accounting  any discount in the arrangement is allocated to the delivered elements 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered  services have been performed or until fair value can objectively be determined 
we sell our products primarily through direct sales 
for indirect sales transactions sold through distributors or resellers  we recognize revenue using the sell through method  meaning revenues are associated with specific customer orders 
in addition  we defer recognition on indirect sales until receipt of payment unless we have a payment history with the reseller or distributor with no late payment experiences 

table of contents accounts receivable we maintain allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of our customers to make required payments 
this requires us to make estimates of future product returns  annual support cancellations and write offs of bad debt accounts related to current period revenues 
the amount of our reserves is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable 
as a percentage of current period revenues  charges against sales allowances for bad debt  sales returns and annual support cancellations were insignificant in both of the years ended december  and if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
additionally  if significant product performance issues were to arise resulting in our accepting sales returns  additional allowances may be required which would result in a reduction of revenue in the period such determination was made 
our standard licensing agreement does not permit customers to return products unless we have breached the product warranty and are unable to cure the breach 
our product warranties are typical industry warranties that a product will perform in accordance with established product requirements 
while such amounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
intangible assets in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of the third quarter of and adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of the first quarter of as required by sfas no 
 we discontinued amortizing the remaining balances of goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal as a result  our annual amortization expense decreased approximately million 
all remaining and future acquired goodwill will be subject to impairment tests annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
all other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we performed our annual impairment review and as a result determined that the carrying value of goodwill was less than the estimated fair value 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units licenses and services  the market approach guideline company method was the methodology deemed the most reliable and used for impairment analysis 
we will perform subsequent annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of each year  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
future impairment reviews may result in charges against earnings to write down the value of goodwill 
purchased intangible assets are recorded at the appraised value and amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of two years to seven years 
the net carrying amount of purchased intangible assets was considered recoverable at december  in accordance with sfas no 
 purchased intangible assets are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we periodically review the carrying value of these assets to determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred 
in the event that in the future it is determined that the purchased intangible assets value has been impaired  an adjustment will be made resulting in a charge for the write down in the period in which the determination is made 

table of contents income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the timing of the recognition of certain revenue items and the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time periods within which the underlying timing differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which could result in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
us income taxes were not provided for on undistributed earnings from certain non us subsidiaries 
those earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested 
accounting for stock based compensation our stock based employee compensation plans are described more fully in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
certain options granted under those plans had an exercise price less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  which is described more fully in note unearned stock based employee compensation costs associated with these options are reflected in net income 
the expense equals the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date and the exercise price of the stock options and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock options  currently four to five years 
we amortize stock based compensation using the straight line method over the remaining vesting periods of the related options  which is generally four to five years 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by sfas no 
this information is required to be determined as if we had accounted for employee stock options and stock purchase plans under the fair value method of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
had employee stock based compensation cost been determined using the fair value method our net income loss would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands  except per share data december  net income loss as reported add stock based compensation expense included in reported net income loss  net of related tax effects deduct total stock based compensation determined under fair value based method for all awards  net of related tax effects pro forma basic net income loss per share as reported pro forma diluted net income loss per share as reported pro forma 
table of contents the fair value of options and shares issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan at the grant date was estimated using the black scholes model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we use projected volatility rates  which are based upon historical volatility rates trended into future years 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options 
the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share in the future years  because the number of future shares to be issued under these plans is not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of fin during the fourth quarter of fiscal and we provided the required disclosures in note commitments and contingencies 
we adopted the recognition provisions of fin effective january  and such adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure effective for fiscal years ending after december  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
sfas no 
does not amend sfas no 
to require companies to account for their employee stock based awards using the fair value method 
the disclosure provisions are required  however  for all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they utilize the fair value method of accounting described in sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method described in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
effective january  the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
we adopted the provisions of fin effective january  we do not have any variable interest entities  thus adoption of fin did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in january  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which requires companies to allocate the consideration received on arrangements 
table of contents involving multiple arrangements based on their relative fair values 
further  this eitf requires that the companies consider the revenue recognition criteria separately for each of the deliverables 
this eitf is applicable for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  early adoption is permitted 
we adopted eitf on january  and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging 
the statement requires that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly and clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except in certain circumstances  and for hedging relationships designated after june  we adopted sfas no 
effective july  and such adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we adopted sfas no 
effective july  and such adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position because we have not issued any of these types of financial instruments 

table of contents risk factors an investment in our shares involves risks and uncertainties 
you should carefully consider the factors described below before making an investment decision in our securities 
the risks described below are the risks that we currently believe are material risks of business and the industry in which we compete 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the following risks 
if we are adversely affected by such risks  then the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods and  as a result  we may fail to meet expectations of investors and analysts  causing our stock price to fluctuate or decline our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
these factors include the following the size and timing of customer orders 
see the size and timing of our customer orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter which could cause fluctuations in our revenues 
the discretionary nature of our customers purchasing decisions and budget cycles  the timing of revenue recognition for sales of software products and services  the extent to which our customers renew their maintenance contracts with us  exposure to general economic conditions and reductions in corporate it spending  changes in our level of operating expenses and our ability to control costs  our ability to attain market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements to our existing products  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  the relative growth rates of competing operating system  database and application platforms  the unpredictability of the timing and level of sales through our indirect sales channels  costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  including amortization costs for intangible assets with indefinite lives  and the timing of releases of new versions of third party software products that our products support or with which our products compete 
fluctuations in our results of operations are likely to affect the market price of our common stock and may not be related to or indicative of our long term performance 
the size and timing of our customer orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter which could cause fluctuations in our revenues and operating results our license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and delivered in that quarter 
our revenues in a given quarter could be adversely affected if we are unable to complete one or more large license agreements  or if the contract terms were to prevent us from recognizing revenue during that quarter 
the sales cycles for certain of our software products  such as vista plus and shareplex  can last from three to nine months and often require pre purchase evaluation periods and customer education 
also  we have often booked a large amount of our sales in the last month  weeks or days of each quarter and delays in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly revenue to fall short of anticipated levels 
finally  while a portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from previously deferred revenue  our quarterly 
table of contents performance will depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
these factors may cause significant periodic variation in our license revenues 
in addition  we incur or commit to operating expenses based on anticipated revenue levels  and generally do not know whether revenues in any quarter will meet expectations until the end of that quarter 
accordingly  if our revenue growth rates slow or our revenues decline  our operating results could be seriously impaired because many of our expenses are relatively fixed in nature and cannot be easily or quickly changed 
general economic conditions and reduced levels of corporate it spending may continue to affect revenue growth rates and impact our business our business and operating results are subject to the effects of changes in general economic conditions 
recent unfavorable economic conditions have resulted in continued reduced corporate it spending in the industries that we serve and a softening of demand for computer software  not only in the database and application market segments we support but also in the product segment in which we compete 
if these economic conditions do not improve  or we experience continued deterioration in general economic conditions or further reduced corporate it spending  our business and operating results could continue to be adversely impacted 
many of our products are vulnerable to direct competition from oracle we compete with oracle in the market for database management solutions and the competitive pressure continues to increase 
we expect that oracle s commitment to and presence in the database management product market will increase in the future and therefore substantially increase competitive pressures 
we believe that oracle will continue to incorporate database management technology into its server software offerings  possibly at no additional cost to its users 
competition from oracle with certain of our database management products including shareplex and quest central for oracle has increased over the last two years and continues to increase with oracle s introduction of the next version of its database  known as oracle g 
oracle g is claimed to have enhanced capabilities in the functions competitive with quest central for oracle and with the oracle monitoring capabilities of foglight 
if oracle g does provide capabilities closely equivalent to those of quest central for oracle  our revenues from that product line would likely be materially adversely affected 
in some cases these platform vendor provided tools are bundled with the platform and in other cases they are separately chargeable products  albeit at significantly lower price points 
the inclusion of the functionality of our software as standard features of the underlying database solution or application supported by our products or sale at much lower cost could erode our revenues  particularly if the competing products and features were of comparable capability to our products 
even if the functionality provided as standard features or lower costs by these system providers is more limited than that of our software  there can be no assurance that a significant number of customers would not elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing our products 
moreover  there is substantial risk that the mere announcements of competing products or features by large competitors such as oracle could result in the delay or cancellation of customer orders for our products in anticipation of the introduction of such new products or features 
many of our products are dependent on database or application technologies of others  if these technologies lose market share or become incompatible with our products  or if these vendors acquire or form strategic relationships with our competitors  the demand for our products could suffer we believe that our success has depended in part  and will continue to depend in part for the foreseeable future  upon our relationships with providers of major database and enterprise software programs  including oracle  ibm  microsoft  sap  siebel and peoplesoft 
our competitive advantage consists in substantial part on the integration between our products and products provided by these major software providers  and our extensive knowledge of their products and technologies 
if these companies for any reason decide to promote technologies and standards that are not compatible with our technologies  or if they lose market share for their database or application products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely 
table of contents affected 
furthermore  these major software vendors could attempt to increase their presence in the markets we serve by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors  and may be in better position to withstand and respond to the current factors impacting this industry 
these companies have longer operating histories  larger installed bases of customers and substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and technical resources than we do  as well as well established relationships with many of our present and potential customers 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies in the future  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced products that achieve widespread market acceptance our future success depends on our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and introducing new products  product updates and services on a timely basis  by extending the operation of our products on new platforms and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
in order to grow our business  we are committing substantial resources to developing software products and services for the applications management market 
if this market does not continue to develop as anticipated  or demand for our products in this market does not materialize or occurs more slowly than we expect  or if our development efforts are delayed or unsuccessful  we will have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenues  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
our operating results may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our international operations are generally conducted through our international subsidiaries  with the associated revenues and related expenses  and balance sheets  denominated in the currency of the country in which the international subsidiaries operate 
as a result  our operating results may be harmed by fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other foreign currencies 
the foreign currencies to which we currently have the most significant exposure are the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro and the australian dollar 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international operations and our planned expansion of our international operations expose us to certain risks we maintain research and development operations in canada  australia  israel and russia  and continue to expand our international sales activities as part of our business strategy 
as a result  we face increasing risks from our international operations  including  among others difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity in europe  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities  potentially adverse tax consequences  potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  delays in localizing our products  political unrest or terrorism  particularly in areas in which we have facilities  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  and licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers 

table of contents operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources and will place additional burdens on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that our investments in establishing facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 
in addition  we have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing them internationally 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business and diversion of management attention we have in the past made and we expect to continue to make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies  including sitraka and our recently announced acquisition of aelita 
any additional acquisitions will require us to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may subject us to liabilities and risks that are not known or identifiable at the time of the acquisition or may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
we may have to use cash  incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
use of cash or debt may affect our liquidity and use of cash would reduce our cash reserves 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our shareholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
in consummating acquisitions  we are also subject to risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
if we are unable to fully integrate acquired businesses  products or technologies with our existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of an acquisition 
we face risks associated with governmental contracting we derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with the united states government and its agencies and from contracts with state and local governments or agencies 
demand and payment for our products and services are impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding availability  with funding reductions or delays adversely impacting public sector demand for our products and services 
public sector customers may also change the way they procure new contracts and may adopt new rules or regulations governing contract procurement  including required competitive bidding or use of open source products  where available 
these factors may limit the growth of or reduce the amount of revenues we derive from the public sector  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
our efforts to constrain costs may strain our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure we are experiencing slower growth and are focused on increasing our operating margins 
these efforts place a strain on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
our ability to manage our operations while reducing operating costs requires us to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures 
although we achieved a year over year increase in our margins from fiscal to  there can be no guarantees that we will be successful in achieving our profitability targets in any future quarterly or annual period 
we may not generate increased business from our current customers  which could slow our revenue growth in the future most of our customers initially make a purchase of our products for a single department or location 
many of these customers may choose not to expand their use of our products 
if we fail to generate expanded business from our current customers  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely 
table of contents affected 
in addition  as we deploy new modules and features for our existing products or introduce new products  our current customers may choose not to purchase this new functionality or these new products 
moreover  if customers elect not to renew their maintenance agreements  our service revenues would be materially adversely affected 
our operating results may be affected if we are required to change our accounting for employee stock options we currently account for the issuance of stock options under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recognized for options granted to employees where the exercise price equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
certain proposals related to treating the grant of an employee stock option as an expense are currently under consideration by accounting standards organizations and governmental authorities 
if such proposals are adopted and we are required to change the way we account for stock options  our operating results could be negatively impacted as a result of the additional expenses associated with stock options 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed presentation of our accounting for stock based compensation plans 
failure to develop strategic relationships could harm our business by denying us selling opportunities and other benefits our current collaborative relationships may not prove to be beneficial to us  and they may not be sustained 
we also may not be able to enter into successful new strategic relationships in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could lose sales opportunities if we fail to work effectively with these parties 
moreover  we expect that maintaining and enhancing these and other relationships will become a more meaningful part of our business strategy in the future 
however  many of our current partners are either actual or potential competitors with us 
in addition  many of these third parties also work with competing software companies and we may not be able to maintain these existing relationships  due to the fact that these relationships are informal or  if written  are terminable with little or no notice 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we generally rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  patent  copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such resulting litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and financial resources  which could harm our business 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may prove to be inadequate and competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we also believe that  because of the rapid rate of technological change in the software industry  trade secret and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our employees  frequent product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of customer support services 

table of contents third parties may claim that our software products or services infringe on their intellectual property rights  exposing us to litigation that  regardless of merit  may be costly to defend our success and ability to compete are also dependent on our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their intellectual property rights 
any such claim  with or without merit  could have a significant effect on our business and financial results 
see legal proceedings in part i  item  of this report  for information concerning copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation claims initiated against quest by computer associates international  inc this and any future third party claim could be time consuming  divert management s attention from our business operations and result in substantial litigation costs  including any monetary damages and customer indemnification obligations  which may result from such claims 
in addition  parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief affecting our ability to license the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property 
as a result of such claims  we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties  develop alternative technology or redesign our products 
we cannot be sure that such licenses would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if a successful claim is made against us and we are unable to develop or license alternative technology  our business and financial results and position could be materially adversely affected 
our business will suffer if our software contains errors the software products we offer are inherently complex 
despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
significant technical challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate it with a number of third party software applications and databases 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support  our operating margins could be harmed 
moreover  we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or if we fail to meet our customers expectations 
as a result of the foregoing  we could experience loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  loss of customers  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us which could  whether or not successful  increase costs and distract our management  and increased insurance costs 
in addition  a product liability claim  whether or not successful  could harm our business by increasing our costs and distracting our management 
we incorporate software licensed from third parties into some of our products and any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could reduce the demand for  or prevent the shipping of  our products certain of our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors 
we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors in our future products 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our 
table of contents products if that software becomes obsolete  defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm our sales unless and until we can secure an alternative source 
although we believe there are adequate alternate sources for the technology licensed to us  such alternate sources may not provide us with the same functionality as that currently provided to us 
natural disasters or power outages could disrupt our business a substantial portion of our operations is located in california  and we are subject to risks of damage and business disruptions resulting from earthquakes  floods  fires and similar events  as well as from power outages 
we have in the past experienced limited and temporary power losses in our california facilities due to power shortages  and we expect in the future to experience additional power losses 
while the impact to our business and operating results has not been material  we cannot assure you that power losses will not adversely affect our business in the future  or that the cost of acquiring sufficient power to run our business will not increase significantly 
since we do not have sufficient redundancy in our networking infrastructure  a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem could have an adverse effect on our business  including both our internal operations and our ability to communicate with our customers or sell and deliver our products 
the demand for our products will depend on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards characterize the market for our products and services 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result of the complexities inherent in today s computing environments and the performance demanded by customers for embedded databases and web based products  new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
as a result  significant delays in the general availability of such new releases or significant problems in the installation or implementation of such new releases could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products or new product enhancements that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards or customer requirements  avoiding difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of these products  or achieving market acceptance for our new products and product enhancements 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel our future success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and other key administrative  sales and marketing and support personnel  many of whom have recently joined our company 
in addition  the success of our business is substantially dependent on the services of our chief executive officer and other executive officers 
there has in the past been and there may in the future be a shortage of personnel that possess the technical background necessary to sell  support and develop our products effectively 
competition for skilled personnel is intense  and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
our business may not be able to grow if we cannot attract qualified personnel 
hiring qualified sales  marketing  administrative  research and development and customer support personnel is very competitive in our industry  particularly in southern california where quest is headquartered 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we transact business in a number of different foreign countries around the world 
in most instances  revenues are collected and operating expenses are paid in the local currency of the country in which we are transacting 
accordingly  we are exposed to incremental volatility in sales and earnings within these countries due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is directly proportional to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as our net foreign investment in us dollar assets 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses 
our cumulative currency gains or losses in any given period are typically lessened by the economic benefits of diversification and low correlation between different currencies  but there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue to be true in future periods 
the foreign currencies to which we currently have the most significant exposure are the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro and the australian dollar 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposures  nor do we use such instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we regularly monitor the potential cost and benefits of hedging foreign exchange exposures with derivatives and there remains the possibility that our foreign exchange hedging practices could change accordingly in time 
interest rate risk our exposure to market interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge the market risks of our investments 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the united states government and its agencies 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of investment grade bonds and united states government and agency securities 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of shareholders equity 
information about our investment portfolio is presented in the table below  which states the amortized book value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity in thousands amortized book value weighted average rate investments maturing by december  thereafter total portfolio we maintain a level of cash and cash equivalents such that we have generally been able to hold our investments to maturity 
accordingly  changes in the market interest rate would not have a material effect on the fair value of such investments
