item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview see item business  significant events regarding corporate restructuring m wave is a value added service provider of high performance circuit boards used in a variety of digital and high frequency application for telecommunications and industrial electronics applications 
m wave s business has been particularly challenging for the past two years  due to the downturn in the telecommunication industry and the resulting decline in customer demand 
the company continues to strive to increase its customer base by signing new supply chain management agreements with new and existing customers 
increasingly  the company is serving as an intermediary for its us customers by brokering the purchase of circuit boards through an established base of asian producers with which it does business 
critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities  and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate and update our estimates and judgments  including those related to the collection of accounts receivable  valuation of inventory  impairment of long lived assets  and amount of warranty obligations 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among other policies  effect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable the company recognizes revenue upon the shipment of its products from its manufacturers to the customer provided that the company has received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  product returns are reasonably estimable  collection of resulting receivable is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
we maintain an allowance for estimated product returns based on historical experience 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions and the profile or our customer mix 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses 
when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  management specifically analyzes accounts receivable on a client by client basis  including customer credit worthiness and current economic trends  and records any necessary bad debt expense based on the best estimate of the facts known to date 
should the facts regarding the collectability of receivables change  the resulting change in the allowance would be charged or credited to income in the period such determination is made 
such a change could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value and includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
reserves are provided for estimated obsolescence or non marketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions were to be less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence is  for compared to  in the reserve was based on specific items identified in the ending inventory 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant decline in operating results relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of assets  changes in technology or significant negative or economic trends 
if this review indicates that the value of an asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the asset will be reduced to the fair value and the remaining depreciation period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
the company recorded impairment of building  plant and equipment charges in of  warranty we provide for the estimated cost of the product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the warranty obligation includes a provision based on historical experience  as well as reserves for specific issues we identify 
to the extent actual warranty charges vary from our historical experience  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
accounting for income taxes we use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided using currently enacted tax rates when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have generated certain deferred tax assets as a result of operating losses and temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
for the year ended december   we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately  as a result of operating losses incurred and reported in  and the uncertainty of the timing and amount of future taxable income 
if the realization of our deferred tax assets in future periods is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to our deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is based on significant estimates 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
compensation costs for employee stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
other other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies relating to fair value of financial instruments  depreciation  and income taxes require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board  securities and exchange commission  etc 
although no specific conclusions reached by these authorities appear likely to cause a material change in the company s accounting policies  outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence 
also see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  which provide a summary of the company s significant accounting policies

in connection with the asset sales and signing of the soa agreement  the company also announced retirement of its million debt to bank one  na that included releases of liens on the collateral securing the note 
the company further indicated that delinquent balances to its trade creditors would be reduced approximately  in line with its previously negotiated terms 
the company  through its wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary  poly circuits  inc  historically has been a value added  domestic producer and international service provider of high performance printed circuit boards pcbs used in a variety of digital and rf applications 
the company s restructuring began in may  necessitated by a continued and unprecedented fall of the telecom sector  with the resultant decrease in net sales 
it was determined that the company could not absorb its direct and administrative costs based on then current and projected business levels  nor could it efficiently manufacture digital and rf pcb s 
the heart of the company s business model is not to be a low cost domestic manufacturer  but to operate a low cost  high performance supply chain pipeline that offers middle market customers a cradle to grave approach to digital and rf pcb procurement  beginning with the birth of a product that requires domestic quick turn  proto types  pilot production runs  and that evolves into mass production in asia 
the company had  from its singapore office  achieved working partnerships with more than asian manufacturers where the company extended its procurement and supply chain services for its middle market customers  a process referred to as virtual manufacturing vm

under the soa agreement  production will transition from the company to asc  in a blending of a traditional outsourcing and a joint venture in one vehicle 
the soa agreement enables asc to immediately take over manufacturing at the company s facility  and  simultaneously acquire certain assets  allowing the company to free up cash  reduce debt  while assuming joint tenancy in west chicago with asc  in a seamless transition that expands the company s far east vm model to a domestic strategy as well 
further highlights of restructuring a under the soa  asc will provide the domestic manufacturing required by the company s customers and be paid for finished product as a supplier to the company 
the company will maintain the sales  support  manufacturing oversight  and logistics for its customers 
the term of the soa agreement is initially two years

gordhan patel  principal shareholder and ceo of asc for the purchase of  shares of its common stock at per share  which vests on the first anniversary of the soa agreement or upon an earlier sale of the company if applicable  and m wave was granted by asc the right to receive of the gain over book value arising from a sale of asc to a third party occurring on or after the first anniversary of the soa agreement if applicable 
b the company sold its west chicago plant to an affiliate of asc for a cash price of approximately  asc has leased the manufacturing portion of that plant from the new owner to enable it to manufacture as required under the soa 
c the company has leased a portion of the west chicago facility to maintain its offices from which it will operate its domestic and international vm  supply chain management  and consulting businesses in close proximity to the domestic manufacturing being performed for its customers by asc 
d the company sold the major portion of its manufacturing equipment at the west chicago facility to a newly formed limited liability company llc for a cash price of  and a preferred and secured interest in that entity 
asc is the other member of the llc and has leased the use of the equipment from it 
the company s preferred interest enables it to receive  in any liquidation  the cash proceeds of the present value of the equipment in excess of the  already received before asc receives any distribution  and distributions are thereafter made to asc and to the company 
continuing with its restructuring strategy  the company confirmed its intention to sell its prior plant and improvements located in bensenville  illinois as soon as practicable
