item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further detail 
patents  licenses and trademarks we rely on trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property products and technology 
we intend to continue this practice in the future to protect our products and technologies 
as of march   we held us patents  us patent applications pending and various corresponding international patents and applications 
our us patents expire in years through we have obtained us federal registrations for the cirrus logic  cirrus and cobranet tm trademarks and our cirrus logic logo trademark 
these us registrations may be renewed as long as the 
table of contents marks continue to be used in interstate commerce 
we have also filed or obtained foreign registration for these marks in other countries or jurisdictions where we conduct  or anticipate conducting  international business 
to complement our own research and development efforts  we have also licensed and expect to continue to license  a variety of intellectual property and technologies important to our business from third parties 
research and development we concentrate our research and development efforts on the design and development of new products for each of our principal markets 
we also fund certain advanced process technology development  as well as other emerging product opportunities 
expenditures for research and development in fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts exclude acquired in process research and development expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of million  million and million  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our future success is highly dependent upon our ability to develop complex new products  to transfer new products to volume production in a timely fashion  to introduce them to the marketplace ahead of the competition and to have them selected for design into products of leading systems manufacturers 
our future success may also depend on assisting our customers with integration of our components into their new products  including providing support from the concept stage through design  launch and production ramp 
competition markets for our products are highly competitive and we expect that competition will continue to increase 
we compete with other semiconductor suppliers that offer standard semiconductors  application specific integrated circuits asics and fully customized integrated circuits  including embedded software  chip and board level products 
a few customers also develop integrated circuits that compete with our products 
our strategy involves providing lower cost versions of existing products and new  more advanced products for customers new designs 
while no single company competes with us in all of our product lines  we face significant competition in each of our major product lines 
we expect to face additional competition from new entrants in our markets  which may include both large domestic and international ic manufacturers and smaller  emerging companies 
the principal competitive factors in our markets include time to market  quality of hardware software design and end market systems expertise  price  product benefits that are characterized by performance  features  quality and compatibility with standards  access to advanced process and packaging technologies at competitive prices  and sales and technical support  including assisting our customers with integration of our components into their new products and providing support from the concept stage through design  launch and production ramp 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  where the customer evaluates alternative design approaches that require integrated circuits 
because our products have not been available from second sources  we generally do not face direct competition in selling our products to a customer once our integrated circuits have been designed into that customer s system 
in products with relatively short life cycles and even shorter design in cycles  for example  dvd recorders  our competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next generation systems 
in the event that competitors succeed in supplanting our products  our market share may not be sustainable and net sales  gross margins and earnings could be adversely affected 
sales  marketing and technical support although we sell products worldwide  we sell principally to asia 
export sales  which include sales to customers with manufacturing plants outside the united states  were percent  percent  and percent in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we maintain a worldwide sales force  which is intended to provide geographically specific selling support to our customers and specialized selling of product lines with unique customer bases 

table of contents our domestic sales force includes a network of regional direct sales offices located in colorado  massachusetts  oregon and texas 
international sales offices and staff are located in hong kong  japan  the people s republic of china  singapore  south korea  taiwan and the united kingdom 
we supplement our direct sales force with external sales representatives and distributors 
our technical support staff is located in california  colorado  indiana  texas  japan  the people s republic of china and singapore 
backlog sales are made primarily pursuant to standard short term purchase orders for delivery of standard products 
the quantity actually ordered by the customer  as well as the shipment schedules  are frequently revised  without significant penalty  to reflect changes in the customer s needs 
we utilize backlog as an indicator to assist us in production planning 
however  backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times 
quantities actually purchased by customers  as well as prices  are subject to variations between booking and delivery to reflect changes in customer needs or industry conditions 
as a result  we believe that our backlog at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues 
employees as of march   we had full time equivalent employees  of whom percent were engaged in research and product development activities  percent in sales  marketing  general and administrative activities and percent in manufacturing related activities 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical  marketing  engineering and administrative personnel 
due to the highly competitive nature of the marketplace that we operate in  we may from time to time lose key employees to our competitors 
we have been able to hire qualified personnel in the past to fill open positions created by these occurrences  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do this in the future 
none of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements 
factors affecting our business and prospects our business faces significant risks 
the risk factors set forth below may not be the only ones that we face 
additional risks that we are not aware of yet or that currently are not material may adversely affect our business operations 
you should read the following cautionary statements in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of cirrus logic s filings with the securities and exchange commission sec 
these cautionary statements are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect the financial condition and results of operations of cirrus logic and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies such as ours 
we operate in a highly cyclical and volatile industry 
we are subject to business cycles and it is difficult to predict the timing  length  or volatility of these cycles 
during downturns  customers usually reduce purchases  delay delivery of products  shorten lead times on orders and or cancel orders 
during upturns  our third party suppliers and contract manufacturers may have supply constraints that result in higher costs  longer lead times  and or an inability to meet customer demand 
these business cycles may create pressure on our net sales  gross margins and operating income 
we cannot assure you that any future downturn or upturn  will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience substantial period to period fluctuations in revenue due to general semiconductor industry conditions or other factors 

table of contents our business is highly dependent on the expansion of the consumer digital entertainment electronics market 
the major focus of our business is the consumer digital entertainment electronics market 
our ics are used in avrs  compressed personal audio players  dvd recorders  digital automotive audio applications and set top boxes 
we expect the consumer digital market to expand over time 
a decline in consumer confidence and consumer spending relating to economic conditions  terrorist attacks  armed conflicts  global health conditions and or the political stability of other countries  however  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our products are complex and could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
product development in the markets we serve is becoming more focused on the integration of multiple functions on individual devices 
there is a general trend towards increasingly complex products 
the greater integration of functions and complexity of operations of our products increases the risk that our customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults after volumes of product have been shipped 
this could result in a material recall and replacement costs for product warranty and support  an adverse impact to our customer relationships by the occurrence of significant defects  a delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share  or failure to achieve market acceptance  and a diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
the occurrence of any of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
in addition  any defects or other problems with our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers who could seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
while we believe that we are reasonably insured against these risks  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance in amounts or of sufficient scope to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liability 
see item legal proceedings for further information regarding outstanding litigation 
our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
our success depends upon our ability to develop new products for new and existing markets  to introduce these products in a timely manner and to have these products gain market acceptance 
the development of new products is highly complex and from time to time  we have experienced delays in developing and introducing these new products 
successful product development and introduction depend on a number of factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion of design and testing of new products  assisting our customers with integration of our components into their new products  including providing support from the concept stage through design  launch and production ramp  successfully developing and implementing the software necessary to integrate our products into our customers products  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields  availability of wafer  assembly and test capacity  
table of contents market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers  and obtaining and retaining industry certification requirements 
although we seek to design products that have the potential to become industry standard products  we cannot assure you that the market leaders will adopt any products introduced by us  or that any products initially accepted by our customers that are market leaders will become industry standard products 
both revenues and margins may be materially affected if new product introductions are delayed  or if our products are not designed into successive generations of our customers products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these challenges  or adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
our failure to develop and introduce new products successfully could harm our business and operating results 
successful product design and development is dependent on our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified design engineers  of which there is a limited number 
due to the complexity and variety of analog and high precision analog and mixed signal circuits  the limited number of qualified circuit designers and the limited effectiveness of computer aided design systems in the design of analog and mixed signal circuits  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis 
we have historically experienced fluctuations in our operating results and expect these fluctuations to continue in future periods 
our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect our net sales  gross margins and operating income 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of our products sold  market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers  competitive pricing pressures  our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing and extent of our research and development expenses  the failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements  disruption in the supply of wafers  assembly or test services  certain production and other risks associated with using independent manufacturers  assembly houses and testers  and product obsolescence  price erosion  competitive developments and other competitive factors 
we need to manage the transition of the sale of our test operations assets to chippac 
on june   we agreed to sell our test operation assets  consisting of analog and mixed signal testers  handlers and wafer probes  to chippac  a provider of ic packaging design  assembly  test and distribution services 
chippac will transfer these test assets to its china facility over the remainder of the fiscal year 
this asset transfer may involve a number or risks  including but not limited to the potential disruption of our ongoing business  possibly having to secure additional capacity with another test provider during fiscal year  as we complete the transfer our testers to chippac in china  the diversion of management s resources involved in monitoring this transition and ensuring that we have adequate test operations during the transition period from other business concerns  and 
table of contents incurring unknown difficulties associated with the transfer of the assets to china  thereby jeopardizing the ongoing testing operations performed by chippac and as a result  adversely affecting our ability to have our products tested in a timely manner 
strong competition in the high performance ic market may harm our business 
the ic industry is intensely competitive and is frequently characterized by rapid technological change  price erosion and design and other technological obsolescence 
because of shortened product life cycles and even shorter design in cycles in a number of the markets that we serve  particularly consumer entertainment  our competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next generation systems 
in the event that competitors succeed in supplanting our products  our market share may not be sustainable and net sales  gross margins and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we compete in a number of fragmented markets 
our principal competitors in these various markets include akm semiconductors  ali semiconductor  amd  atmel  analog devices  broadcom  conexant  ess technologies  freescale semiconductor  fujitsu dsp  intel  linear technology  lsi logic  maxim  mediatek  micronas  philips  samsung semiconductor  sharp semiconductor  sigmatel  st microelectronics  sunplus  texas instruments  tripath  wolfson and zoran  many of whom have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing  marketing  technical  distribution and other resources  broader product lines  greater intellectual property rights and longer relationships with customers than we have 
we also expect intensified competition from emerging companies and from customers who develop their own ic products 
in addition  some of our current and future competitors maintain their own fabrication facilities  which could benefit them in connection with cost  capacity and technical issues 
increased competition could adversely affect our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of our products and result in price reductions and increases in expenses that could adversely affect our business and our financial condition 
our products may be subject to average selling prices that decline over short time periods  if we are unable to increase our volumes  introduce new or enhanced products with higher selling prices or reduce our costs  our business and operating results could be harmed 
historically in the semiconductor industry  average selling prices of products have decreased over time  while manufacturing costs remained fixed 
if the average selling price of any of our products declines and we are unable to increase our unit volumes  introduce new or enhanced products with higher margins and or reduce manufacturing costs to offset anticipated decreases in the prices of our existing products  our operating results may be adversely affected 
in addition  because of procurement lead times  we are limited in our ability to reduce total costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
because of these factors  we may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have significant international sales and risks associated with these sales that could harm our operating results 
export sales  principally to asia  include sales to u 
s based customers with manufacturing plants overseas and accounted for percent  percent and percent of our net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect export sales to continue to represent a significant portion of product sales 
this reliance on sales internationally subjects us to the risks of conducting business internationally  including political and economic stability and global health conditions  especially in asia 
for example  the financial instability in a given region  such as asia  may have an adverse impact on the financial position of end users in the region  which could impact future orders and harm our results of operations 
our international sales operations involve a number of other risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
table of contents changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for technology  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  competition with foreign companies or other domestic companies entering the foreign markets in which we operate  longer sales and payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
in addition  we may buy hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations and our competitive position can be affected by the exchange rate of the us dollar against other currencies 
consequently  increases in the value of the dollar would increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive 
alternatively  decreases in the value of the dollar will increase the relative cost of our and our vendors operations that are based overseas 
we cannot assure you that regulatory  political and other factors will not adversely affect our operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices 
the expansion of our international operations subjects our business to additional economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our business 
in addition to export sales constituting a majority of our net sales  we are expanding our international operations 
specifically  we have recently focused our efforts on expanding in the people s republic of china by employing design  sales and technical support personnel 
in addition  we are also using contract manufacturers in the region for foundry  assembly and or test operations 
expansion into this region has required and will continue to require significant management attention and resources 
we have limited experience in the chinese market and may not succeed in expanding our presence into this market or other international markets 
failure to do so could harm our business 
in addition  there are risks inherent in expanding our presence into foreign regions  including  but not limited to difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  failure of foreign laws to protect our us proprietary rights adequately  additional vulnerability from terrorist groups targeting american interests abroad  legal uncertainty regarding liability and compliance with foreign laws  and regulatory requirements 
our sales may fluctuate due to seasonality of customer demand 
as our sales to the consumer entertainment market increase  we are more likely to be affected by seasonality in the sales of our products 
in particular  a significant portion of consumer electronics products are sold worldwide during the back to school and holiday seasons 
as a result  we expect stronger sales of devices into the consumer entertainment market to occur in our second and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of these seasons 
if we fail to attract  hire and retain qualified personnel  we may not be able to develop  market  or sell our products or successfully manage our business 
competition for personnel in our industry is intense 
the number of technology companies in the geographic areas in which we operate is greater than it has been historically and we expect competition for qualified personnel to intensify 
there are only a limited number of people in the job market with the requisite 
table of contents skills 
our human resources organization focuses significant efforts on attracting and retaining individuals in key technology positions 
for example  start up companies generally offer larger equity grants to attract individuals from more established companies 
the loss of the services of any key personnel or our inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills could restrict our ability to develop new products or enhance existing products in a timely manner  sell products to our customers  or manage our business effectively 
we may incur inventory charges or write downs as a result of shifts in industry wide capacity and our practice of purchasing our products based on sales forecasts 
shifts in industry wide capacity from shortages to oversupply  or from oversupply to shortages  may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results 
we must order wafers and build inventory well in advance of product shipments 
because our industry is highly cyclical and is subject to significant downturns resulting from excess capacity  overproduction  reduced demand  order cancellations  or technological obsolescence  there is a risk that we will forecast inaccurately and produce excess inventories of particular products 
in addition  we generally order our products through non cancelable orders from third party foundries based on our sales forecasts and our customers can generally cancel or reschedule orders they place with us without significant penalties 
if we do not receive orders as anticipated by our forecasts  or customers cancel orders that are placed  we may experience increased inventory levels 
due to the product manufacturing cycle characteristic of ic manufacturing and the inherent imprecision by our customers to accurately forecast their demand  product inventories may not always correspond to product demand  leading to shortages or surpluses of certain products 
as a result of such inventory imbalances  future inventory write downs or charges may occur due to lower of cost or market accounting  excess inventory  or inventory obsolescence 
we rely on independent foundries to manufacture our products  which subjects us to increased risks 
we rely on independent foundries to manufacture all of our wafers 
our reliance on these foundries involves several risks and uncertainties  including the possibility of an interruption or loss of manufacturing capacity  the lack of control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and costs  the inability to secure necessary capacity to meet customer demand  possible misappropriation of our intellectual property  and the inability to reduce our costs as quickly as competitors who manufacture their own products and are not bound by set prices 
market conditions could result in wafers being in short supply and prevent us from having adequate supply to meet our customer requirements 
in addition  any prolonged inability to utilize third party foundries because of fire  natural disaster  or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and  consequently  our sales would likely be reduced and we may be forced to purchase wafers from higher cost suppliers or to pay expediting charges to obtain additional supply  if we are able to acquire wafers at all 
in order to secure additional foundry capacity  we may enter into contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of silicon wafers over extended periods 
in the future  we may not be able to secure sufficient capacity with foundries in a timely fashion or at all and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
these penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 

table of contents we are dependent on our subcontractors in asia to perform key manufacturing functions for us 
we depend on third party subcontractors in asia for the assembly  packaging and testing of our products 
international operations and sales may be subject to political and economic risks  including changes in current tax laws  political instability  global health conditions  currency controls  exchange rate fluctuations and changes in import export regulations  tariff and freight rates  as well as the risks of natural disaster 
although we seek to reduce our dependence on our limited number of subcontractors  this concentration of subcontractors and manufacturing operations in asia subjects us to the risks of conducting business internationally  including political and economic conditions in asia 
disruption or termination of the assembly  packaging or testing of our products could occur and such disruptions could harm our business and operating results 
failure to manage our distribution channel relationships could adversely affect our business 
in fiscal years  and  sales to our distributors accounted for percent  percent and percent  respectively  of our net sales 
the future of our business  as well as the future growth of our business  will depend in part on our ability to manage our relationships with current and future distributors and external sales representatives and to develop additional channels for the distribution and sale of our products 
the inability to successfully do so could adversely affect our business 
we may need to acquire other companies or technologies and successfully integrate them into our business to compete in our industry 
we continue to consider future acquisitions of other companies  or their technologies or products  to improve our market position  broaden our technological capabilities and expand our product offerings 
however  we may not be able to acquire  or successfully identify  the companies  products or technologies that would enhance our business 
in addition  if we are able to acquire companies  products or technologies  we could experience difficulties in integrating them 
integrating acquired businesses involves a number of risks  including  but not limited to the potential disruption of our ongoing business  unexpected costs or incurring unknown liabilities  the diversion of management s resources from other business concerns while involved in identifying  completing  and integrating acquisitions  the inability to retain the employees of the acquired businesses  difficulties relating to integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  adverse effects on the existing customer relationships of acquired companies  the potential incompatibility of business cultures  adverse effects associated with entering into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which we have little experience  and acquired intangible assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements  or worse than expected performance of the acquired company 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business could be harmed 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights from third party claims and litigation 
our success depends on our ability to obtain patents and licenses and to preserve our other intellectual property rights covering our manufacturing processes  products and development and testing tools 
we seek patent protection for those inventions and technologies for which we believe such protection is suitable and is likely to provide a competitive advantage to us 
we also rely substantially on trade secrets  proprietary technology  non disclosure and other contractual agreements  and technical measures to protect our technol 
table of contents ogy and manufacturing know how 
we work actively to foster continuing technological innovation to maintain and protect our competitive position 
we cannot assure you that steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be adequate  that our competitors will not independently develop or patent substantially equivalent or superior technologies or be able to design around our patents  or that our intellectual property will not be misappropriated 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property as well as the laws of the united states 
potential intellectual property claims and litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could invalidate our proprietary rights 
the ic industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we may find it necessary to initiate a lawsuit to assert our patent or other intellectual property rights 
these legal proceedings could be expensive  take significant time and divert management s attention from other business concerns 
we cannot assure you that we will ultimately be successful in any lawsuit 
nor can we assure you that any patent owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented  or challenged  that rights granted under the patent will provide competitive advantages to us  or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
as is typical in the ic industry  we and our customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting patents  mask work rights  or copyrights 
in the event third parties were to make a valid intellectual property claim and a license was not available on commercially reasonable terms  our operating results could be harmed 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources  may also be necessary to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
an unfavorable outcome in any such suit could have an adverse effect on our future operations and or liquidity 
some of our products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted by end users in our markets 
generally  our products comprise only a part of a device 
all components of such devices must uniformly comply with industry standards in order to operate efficiently together 
we depend on companies that provide other components of the devices to support prevailing industry standards 
many of these companies are significantly larger and more influential in affecting industry standards than we are 
some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our customers or end users 
if larger companies do not support the same industry standards that we do  or if competing standards emerge  market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected and our business would be harmed 
the emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by other suppliers 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time  we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins 
we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
if we are unable to make continued substantial investments in research and development  we may not be able to develop and sell new products 
we make significant investments in research and development activities to develop new and enhanced products and solutions 
if we fail to make sufficient investments in research and development programs  new technologies could render our current and planned products obsolete  and our business could be harmed

the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly 
this fluctuation is the result of numerous factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements concerning our business or those of our competitors or customers  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform as anticipated by the analysts  announcements regarding technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  or capital commitment  announcements by us of significant divestitures or sale of certain assets or intellectual property  litigation arising out of a wide variety of matters  including  among others  employment matters and intellectual property matters  departure of key personnel  general conditions in the ic industry  and general market conditions and interest rates 
we have provisions in our charter  and are subject to certain provisions of delaware law  which could prevent  delay or impede a change of control of our company 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  and delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if our stockholders support the acquisition 
these provisions include our rights plan  which the board of directors adopted in may as an anti takeover measure 
the provisions of this plan can be triggered only in certain limited circumstances following the tenth day after a person or group announces acquisitions of or tender offers for percent or more of our common stock  elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  and a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders
