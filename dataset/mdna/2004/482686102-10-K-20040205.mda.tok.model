overview the company designs  develops and markets athletic footwear for high performance sports use  fitness activities and casual wear under the k swiss brand  and also designs and manufactures footwear under the royal elastics brand 
royal elastics is our wholly owned subsidiary 
the categories of footwear we sell is explained in more detail in item  under the subheading  products 
we market our products in the united states through our sales executives and independent sales representatives primarily to a limited number of specialty athletic footwear stores  pro shops  sporting good stores and department stores 
we also sell through our products through our website and to a number of foreign distributors 
in the fourth quarter of  we reached an agreement with national geographic to end our licensing agreement 
operations of the national geographic brand have been accounted for and shown as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial information 
in  we had a net cash inflow of approximately  from continuing operating activities and a net cash outflow from investing activities due to the net purchase of property  plant and equipment 
we anticipate future cash needs for principal repayments required pursuant to any borrowings under our lines of credit and  depending on future growth  additional funds may be required by operating activities 
on october   our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional million of class a common stock from time to time on the open market 
this program was adopted because we believe repurchasing our shares can be a good use of excess cash 
there was no debt at december  excluding outstanding letters of credit of  million  and our working capital increased  to approximately  at december  from  at december  at december   our total futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were  an increase of from the comparable period of the prior year 
of this amount  domestic futures orders were  an increase of  and international futures orders were  an increase of 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we recognize that the athletic footwear industry is highly competitive 
each of the largest makers of footwear have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources as well as greater brand awareness than us 
because we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of products 
our total revenues increased in from  due to an increase in the volume of footwear sold offset by a decrease in the average underlying wholesale price  and our overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  was in and likewise  our overall selling  general and administrative expenses also increased in from 
table of contents in  our largest single marketing expenditure was television 
our marketing campaign was run mainly on network and cable television  and was supported by sports  music and general interest fashion magazines 
our independent sales representatives sold to approximately  separate accounts as of december  up from  as of december  
internationally  by the end of  we were working through international subsidiaries and distributors to market our products in potentially countries 
also  during  the foot locker store group and its affiliates accounted for approximately of total revenues 
in  approximately of our footwear products were manufactured in china 
we have no long term manufacturing agreements  but we believe that our relationships with our producers are satisfactory and that we will have the ability to develop alternative sources for our footwear  as well 
our operations could  however  be materially and adversely affected if a substantial delay occurred in locating and obtaining alternative producers 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  sales returns and allowances  and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record the estimated income reductions from estimated sales returns and allowances 
we base our estimates on historical rates of returns and allowances 
in the past  actual returns and allowances have not exceeded our reserves 
however  actual returns and allowances in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase in the period in which we made such determination 

table of contents accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses based on our knowledge of the financial condition of certain customers  as well as an assessment of the overall conditions at retail 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  we provide for estimated losses resulting from differences that arise from the gross carrying value of our receivables and the amounts which customers estimate are owed to us 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the market value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated market value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgment about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred

royal elastics brand revenues were  in domestic and  in domestic 
we believe that the athletic and casual footwear industry experiences seasonal fluctuations  due to increased domestic sales during certain selling seasons  including easter  back to school and the year end holiday seasons 
we present full line offerings for the easter and back to school seasons  for delivery during the first and third quarters  respectively  but not for the year end holiday season 
at december   domestic and international futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were approximately  and  respectively  and higher  respectively  than such orders were at december  for start ship dates of the comparable period of the prior year 
these orders are not necessarily indicative of revenues for subsequent periods because the mix of future and at once orders can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and the rate of customer order cancellations can also vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  were in and overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  of revenues in from  of revenues in the increase in the amounts for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of increases in advertising expenses  compensation and related expenses  including an increase in the bonus accrual for an employee incentive program  commission due to increased revenues  legal expenses and warehousing expenses

in and  the net outflow of cash from our financing activities was used for the purchase of treasury stock and to pay cash dividends  partially offset by proceeds from stock options exercised 
we anticipate future cash needs for principal repayments required pursuant to any borrowings under our lines of credit facilities 
in addition  depending on our future growth rate  additional funds may be required by operating activities 
finally  at december   approximately  of foreign subsidiary earnings which are not considered indefinitely invested may eventually be remitted to the parent company as circumstances warrant 
upon receipt of these funds  we will use approximately  in cash to pay income taxes previously accrued on these foreign subsidiary earnings 
our intention is to repatriate earnings of foreign operations as cash needs and other circumstances require 
no other material capital commitments exist at december  with continued use of our revolving credit facility as discussed below  we believe our present and currently anticipated sources of capital are sufficient to sustain our anticipated capital needs for the remainder of in october  we announced the completion of our september million stock repurchase program and a new authorization by the board of directors for us to repurchase through december up to an additional million of our class a common stock from time to time on the open market  as market conditions warrant 
on october   the board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase through december up to an additional million of our class a common stock

at december   our operating lease obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating lease obligations we did not enter into any off balance sheet arrangements during or  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at december  or our working capital increased  to  at december  from  at december  we have historically maintained higher levels of inventory relative to sales compared to our competitors because we do not ship directly to our major domestic customers from our foreign contract manufacturers to the same extent as our larger competitors  which would reduce inventory levels and increase inventory turns  and unlike many of our competitors  we designate certain shoes as core products whereby we commit to our retail customers that we will carry core products from season to season and  therefore  we attempt to maintain open stock positions on our core products in our mira loma  california distribution center to meet at once orders 
we intend to increase direct shipments to our customers from our foreign contract manufacturers in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposure is the risk of unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management  which reviews and approves our risk management policies 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in foreign exchange rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
foreign exchange rate risk sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which are primarily sales to customers in europe  expose us to market risk from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and the foreign currency 
our historical primary risk exposures have been from changes in the rates between the us dollar and the euro 
this trend is expected to continue 
in  we did not enter into forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currency denominated in euros to fix the us dollar amount we will receive on sales denominated in that currency 
the extent to which forward exchange contracts are used is modified periodically in response to our management s estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of specific sales contracts 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and not to engage in currency speculation 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows us to reduce our exposure to the risk that the eventual dollar net cash inflow resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
we do 
table of contents not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the foreign exchange contracts are designated for firmly committed or forecasted sales 
these contracts are generally expected to occur in less than one year 
gains and losses of foreign exchange contracts that are designated for forecasted transactions are recognized as the exchange rates change 
the forward exchange contracts generally require us to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity  at rates agreed at the inception of the contracts 
the counter party to derivative transactions is a major financial institution with investment grade or better credit rating  however  we are exposed to credit risk with this institution 
the credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should this counter party fail to perform as contracted 
the company did not have any foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding as of december  and inflation we believe that distributors of footwear in the higher priced end of the footwear market  including ours  are able to adjust their prices in response to an increase in direct and general and administrative expenses  without a significant loss in sales 
accordingly  to date  inflation and changing prices have not had a material adverse effect on our revenues or earnings
