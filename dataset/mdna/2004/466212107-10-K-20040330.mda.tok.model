item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview jmar technologies  inc develops  manufactures  and supports advanced laser  automated alignment and positioning  and sensor systems for applications in the semiconductor  biotech  homeland security and nanotechnology markets 
the us department of defense is the principal source of funds for the company s collimated plasma lithography cpl light source  x ray stepper systems  and x ray mask research and development programs 
jmar also provides x ray steppers and services to the university of wisconsin s center for nanotechnology  to bae systems in new hampshire  and to others 
in addition to the development of nanolithography tools  jmar provides semiconductor fabrication process integration and maintenance support to the department of defense s defense microelectronics activity in sacramento  california 
as noted in sources of revenues below  over percent of the company s revenues are derived from government contracts or related subcontracts 
these contracts generate intellectual property owned by the company with limited residual rights held by the government in areas in which the company believes there are significant commercial applications 
in addition to commercial opportunities  reliance on these contracts has presented certain challenges and risks 
opportunities  challenges and risks our program to produce cpl light sources for semiconductor lithography has proven to be technologically challenging  evolving over the past decade from scientific research and development  to laboratory proof of concept  to the current beta stage 
in we successfully integrated our cpl source with our systems division x ray stepper and printed high quality patterns on wafers 
our initial operating experience with the beta cpl source taught us that fundamental engineering refinement is necessary to achieve the levels of power stability and operational reliability needed for sustained lithography operations 
we made the management decision to start work on a second cpl source that will retain many of the design elements of the existing cpl source  but embodies new engineering solutions where necessary 
this decision also involved proactive steps to complement research division s traditional excellence in laser science with a team of skilled mechanical  electrical and software engineers 
this new team of engineers is working to increase the x ray power output and reliability of our cpl source to meet the needs of compound semiconductor chip manufacturing and other applications 
we believe that this work will continue to be largely funded by our darpa contract  but could require financing beyond the funding provided by the company s government contracts 
failure to resolve these challenges within the timeframe demanded by potential customers may have an adverse impact on the success of our efforts to manufacture and sell our cpl systems 
in addition  the company s cost models contemplate that multiple suppliers will emerge and greater volume purchases of high cost components will result in reduced cpl source manufacturing costs and appropriate gross margins 
cpl offers dramatically increased throughput for compound semiconductor manufacturing compared to the use of direct write e beam lithography 
the compound semiconductor market is not expanding at the fast pace predicted three years ago because of the unanticipated decline in the telecom industry  and so the expected increased demand for the increased throughput offered by the company s cpl system has been delayed 
although the company plans to enter this market when it recovers  we cannot estimate when we will receive our first cpl system order for the compound semiconductor market 
however  jmar s work to upgrade its cpl source to achieve higher x ray power with high reliability should position jmar for the compound semiconductor market s recovery 
the company believes that its cpl source technology is also a potential candidate to meet the semiconductor industry s need to produce better contact holes in semiconductor chips  but considerable challenges must be overcome 
if immersion lithography is successful down to the nm node  the 
table of contents need for the company s cpl system as a mix and match solution to the contact hole problem will be greatly diminished 
furthermore  the silicon contact hole market at the nm feature will require production systems by for jmar to enter the silicon contact hole market in  an end user foundry or chip manufacturer must commit to jmar s xrl solution in thereby providing the lead time needed to develop appropriate stepper  mask and resist technology for this niche market 
finally  in order to meet the needs for the contact hole market  jmar must improve cpl source reliability  increase its power output to watts from the watts produced today  and reduce projected manufacturing cost to create a viable commercial source 
once cpl is successful in the contact hole segment of the silicon market  the company plans to position its sources more broadly to the mainstream silicon market as the most cost effective approach to lithography at the nm node and below 
production systems for this market will not be required until  with development systems being provided in the earlier years 
since  the company has been working actively to establish strong alliances with the semiconductor industry to deliver cpl to the mainstream silicon market 
jmar is continuing these efforts  but does not yet have a commitment from an industry partner 
however  the company is optimistic that once the beta cpl stepper system is fully operational and reliable  the company will make faster progress in forming an alliance that brings together the industry support needed to move cpl forward 
achieving market acceptance for our new and proposed cpl products requires a significant effort to convince semiconductor manufacturers to adopt the company s cpl technology over other alternative lithography technologies 
this will require substantial technical  marketing and sales efforts and the expenditure of significant funds 
currently  the semiconductor industry is exploring several different technologies for its near term and long term lithography needs  some of which currently have greater acceptance than cpl 
in addition to its cpl efforts  the company is pursuing other laser produced plasma lpp applications 
jmar has worked with the university of central florida over the past three years to develop lpp based extreme ultraviolet euv lithography light source technology 
jmar believes that the knowledge and ip resulting from this work positions jmar to participate in euv source development on a contract basis 
jmar is also investigating opportunities to use its lpp x ray source technology in non lithography applications such as the potential development of a table top x ray microscope for the research and biotech communities 
jmar s systems division is working to apply its automation systems expertise to design and produce advanced sensor systems 
in alliance with femtotrace  inc a company formed with technology licensed from jpl  jmar is designing and manufacturing portable sensor systems capable of detecting  in real time  minute quantities of pcbs and pfts for end use by utilities in the us and europe 
the company s systems division is working to expand its relationship with femtotrace for the production of advanced sensor systems read by marketing this ultra sensitive sensor technology for military and homeland security applications 
the company s microelectronics division provides semiconductor process integration services under contracts that support the department of defense s mission to ensure a supply of semiconductor products for military systems 
this division is also in the custom application specific integrated circuit asic business 
it seeks to increase its revenue base by expanding its asic business to include power management chip fabrication 
sources of revenue currently  over percent of the company s revenues are derived as the prime contractor or subcontractor for government contracts 
the most significant ongoing contract is the multi year million contract issued to jmar s research division by the us army research laboratory sponsored by 
table of contents darpa for further development of the company s cpl system 
through  a total of million has been received under this contract and the company expects to receive an additional million in funding in although the million funding has been appropriated by congress  darpa controls the timing of the funding 
the company had expected to receive million of this million in funding by december  darpa had not released these funds to jmar by december  darpa had indicated that they would release the million in funds upon the successful completion of a reliability and performance test  which was completed on march  on march   based on the preliminary results of the tests  darpa released  of these funds  with the remaining  to be released upon satisfaction of further milestones 
the release of the remaining million during is also subject to milestones related to the further improvement of the beta source 
the company believes that it will meet all of the milestones for release of all of the remaining million 
jmar s next most significant contract is a million contract issued to jmar s systems division by naval air warfare center ad to procure sub nm x ray masks used in the development and production of high performance gaas mmics navair contract 
through  a total of million has been received under this contract and the company expects to receive million in funding in the funding for this contract has also been appropriated by congress 
in connection with the award of the navair contract  the company entered into a subcontract with ibm to manufacture and deliver x ray masks to jmar 
in october  the company was notified by ibm that effective december  it was discontinuing its vermont x ray lithography mask making operations and terminating this subcontract 
the company believes it has sufficient masks for its planned lithography exposure tests until another mask supplier subcontract can be signed 
the company has had discussions with other mask suppliers and believes that it will enter into a subcontract with one or more of these suppliers in to continue to provide masks 
the failure to redirect the navair contract funding to an alternative mask supplier or other project of interest to navair  could result in a shortfall in recognizing the full million expected under the navair contract in the third major ongoing revenue source involves the subcontract between jmar s microelectronics division and gdais to enhance and maintain the semiconductor wafer fabrication processes installed at the mcclellan air force base in sacramento for the dmea 
this work  which started in  has resulted in a new subcontract each year out of funds available in the dmea s budget as an element of the department of defense s advanced technology support program 
the company received million and million in contracts in and  respectively  for this program 
additionally  in  the company has submitted five small business innovative research proposals to the us government of approximately  each in the areas of x ray microscopy  laser communications  missile defense  oceanic mine detection and material processing 
management believes that the work performed under the above contracts has commercial applications  particularly the work under the darpa contract for the development of jmar s cpl technology 
in february  the company received million in financing from laurus master fund laurus 
we intend to use these funds to initiate and advance new product research and development efforts and to acquire or license products  technologies or businesses to expand our revenue base and potential 
while we believe these investments will lead to increased revenue in the future  the initial expenditure of these funds will increase the company s research and development expenses and  correspondingly  its net loss in the near term 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  
table of contents revenues 
total revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  of which contract revenues accounted for  and  respectively 
revenues by segment for and were as follows research division systems division microelectronics division the decrease in revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues of the research and systems divisions related to the darpa contract of  due to lower funding received on that contract 
this decrease was offset in part by an increase in contract revenues at the microelectronics division of  related to the receipt of approximately million in contracts from gdais in february for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   there was also an increase in the navair contract revenues of  at the systems division

also  interest expense for the year ended december  includes  related to the discounted liability for the retirement in august of the company s former chairman and chief executive officer 
liquidity and financial condition cash and cash equivalents at december  was  the increase in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents from to of  resulted primarily from proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock of  and the conversion of  of restricted cash to unrestricted cash due to the termination of the line of credit with comerica bank in march offset by cash used in continuing operations of  primarily related to operating losses and a reduction in liabilities and cash used in discontinued operations of  at december   the company had working capital of jmar s operations will continue to use cash in for  among other requirements  product research and development efforts and to acquire or license products  technologies or businesses  temporary funding delays related to government contracts  corporate costs  primarily related to the cost of being a public company  facility costs for discontinued businesses  preferred stock redemptions and dividends  and other working capital needs 
as a result of the financing activity discussed below  management believes that the company has adequate resources to fund operations and working capital requirements at least through december  however  the company has determined that it will require additional financing to complete or accelerate the development of some of its high value emerging new products  including its patented cpl systems for the manufacture of high performance semiconductors 
working capital deficit as of december  and was  and  respectively 
the increase in working capital is primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock of million and the conversion into common stock of  of the company s line of credit  offset in part by the classification as a current liability as of december  of million in notes owed to the former sal noteholders due in february and the company s losses 
in february  the company repaid the full amount of the notes to the former sal noteholders  plus accrued interest  by retiring a total of  in notes and  in accrued interest with the issuance of  shares of common stock valued at per share and repaying the remaining amount of  in notes and accrued interest of  with cash 

table of contents in march  the company entered into a revolving fixed price convertible note working capital line with laurus 
the working capital line allows the company to borrow from time to time up to of eligible accounts receivable of the company to a maximum of million 
advances in excess of this formula are allowed  however  with the consent of laurus 
laurus can convert any portion of the principal outstanding to common stock at a fixed price per share conversion price any time the market price of the company s common stock is in excess of the conversion price 
the company can convert a portion of the principal outstanding to common stock at the conversion price if the market price of the company s common stock averages of the conversion price or higher for consecutive trading days 
the initial terms of the working capital line provided that after million of conversions into equity  the conversion price would be increased 
the conversion price initially was  but was increased to in january after million of the working capital line had been converted 
the interest rate on the working capital line is equal to the prime rate at december  plus percent  subject to a floor of percent 
accrued interest is payable monthly 
the working capital line requires that the company s quick ratio  as defined  be or higher 
the quick ratio is defined as the sum of cash and accounts receivable divided by the sum of current liabilities  exclusive of current liabilities of discontinued operations 
the company s quick ratio was at december  as of december   approximately million was outstanding under the working capital line 
the term of the working capital line runs until march  the available borrowings under the working capital line were approximately million at december   based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable at that date  with approximately  unused at december  in and  the company sold the following series of preferred stock to laurus for cash converted in converted in conversion shares shares issuance date series amount dividend price amount issued amount issued march  a    march  b    september  c   december  d   january  e  february  f  february  g  february  h  the series d  e  f  g and h preferred stock are redeemable in cash or common stock if the closing market price of the company s common stock is of the conversion price or higher for the trading days prior to the redemption date at various amounts and dates see below under commitments  if not previously converted 
conversions to equity are offset against the required repayments 
except for the conversion price  the conversion terms of the series d through h preferred stock are the same as the conversion terms of the working capital line 
in connection with all of the above financing transactions with laurus  the company issued warrants to laurus to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at prices ranging from to 
in addition  laurus was granted the right to receive a warrant to purchase one share of common stock at for every of principal of the working capital line converted to equity in excess of the first million up to a total of  shares 
the shares of common stock issuable to laurus under all of the preferred stock and warrants described above have been included in registration statements declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 

table of contents in february   under a shelf registration statement  the company sold  shares of its common stock and a warrant for  shares  exercisable at per share  for gross proceeds of  the company s stockholders equity was  as of december  in may   the company transferred to the nasdaq smallcap market  where it is required to maintain no less than million of stockholders equity to retain its listing 
continued losses without increases in equity would cause the company to fall below this nasdaq requirement  which would require it to come into compliance or face delisting 
the delisting of the company s stock could adversely affect its ability to raise funds in the future 
the company believes that it has available to it several potential sources of capital to meet nasdaq listing standards  particularly the above described financings 
in february the company received approximately million in additional contracts from general dynamics

for the first earnout  the sal creditors were eligible to receive  in convertible notes upon the satisfaction of a stepper limited throughput test without the cpl light source by june  this requirement was not met by the june  deadline  and  therefore  the company did not have to issue the  in convertible notes 
for the second earnout  the sal shareholders can earn  in convertible notes upon the satisfaction of a lithography demonstration milestone 
this milestone must be met days after the company s cpl beta source is integrated with the stepper at the systems division in vermont and has satisfied certain negotiated source performance criteria 
in successful tests of the integrated system in march  the source demonstrated improved reliability and performance  however  the specific source performance criteria specified in the merger agreement have not yet been met 
if issued  the  in convertible notes will be due months after issuance and will have a conversion price equal to of the average of the closing prices for the ten days prior to issuance 
the third earnout condition can result in payment of up to  jmar shares and up to million in convertible notes upon receipt by the company of a qualifying order for a cpl system from a commercial customer and delivery to the customer 
under the merger agreement  the deadline for receipt of this order is days after the cpl source is integrated with the stepper at the systems division in vermont and has satisfied the above mentioned source performance criteria 
if earned  this earnout payment is payable days after delivery and acceptance of the system by the customer 
at december   the company had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards subject to certain annual limitations  which expire from through to the extent the company has taxable income in the future  these carryforwards may be used by the company to reduce its cash outlay for taxes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses jmar s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenues  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  litigation accrual  warranty reserve and stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenues product revenues are recognized when the product is shipped fob shipping point  all risks of ownership have passed to the customer and the company has performed all obligations in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 

contract revenues are recognized based on the percentage of completion method wherein income is recognized pro rata over the life of the contract based on the ratio of total incurred costs to anticipated total costs of the contract 
the program manager prepares a statement of work  schedule and 
table of contents budget for each contract 
at least monthly  actual costs are compared to budget and technical progress is compared to the planned schedule 
the company prepares an estimate of costs to complete for each contract at least quarterly 
estimated losses based on this review are fully charged to operations when identified 
actual costs could differ from these estimated costs 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   the company has established reporting units and applies a two step fair value approach to evaluating goodwill impairment  using at least an annual assessment 
the company compares the fair value of the business unit with the carrying amount of the assets associated with the business unit 
the fair value of each business unit is determined using a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of estimated future cash flows and a consideration of market capitalization of the company 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
patent costs capitalized are amortized over ten years  and other intangible assets are amortized over not more than five years 
patent costs capitalized are reviewed quarterly for realizability 
beneficial conversion feature in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
and fasb eitf no 
 the company records a beneficial conversion feature bcf related to the issuance of convertible preferred stock and convertible debt that have conversion features at fixed rates that are in the money when issued and records the fair value of warrants issued with those instruments 
the bcf for the convertible instruments and fair value of warrants is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds to additional paid in capital and as a discount to the convertible instrument equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion features 
such amount is calculated at the issuance date as the difference between the conversion price and the relative fair value of the common stock and warrants into which the security is convertible or exercisable 
for convertible preferred stock and related warrants  the recorded discount is recognized as a dividend from the date of issuance to the earlier of the redemption dates or the conversion dates using the effective yield method 
for convertible debt and related warrants  the recorded discount is recognized as interest expense using the effective yield method based on the life of the debt  over the period from the issuance date to the conversion dates 
deferred taxes jmar records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized in the foreseeable future  based on estimates of foreseeable future taxable income and taking into consideration historical operating information 
in the event management estimates that it will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  a valuation allowance is recorded through a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should management estimate that it will be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded asset  an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
litigation accrual estimated amounts for litigation reserves that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities 
estimates are based upon the facts and circumstances of each case and  in part  on advice from legal counsel regarding probable outcomes  if determinable 
management reviews its estimates on a quarterly basis 

table of contents stock based compensation plans the company accounts for its stock option and warrant plans under apb opinion no 
 using the intrinsic value method  under which no compensation cost has been recognized for issuances to employees 
options and warrants issued to non employees other than directors are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instrument issued 
the fair value is calculated based on the black scholes pricing model 
the resulting value is amortized over the service period
