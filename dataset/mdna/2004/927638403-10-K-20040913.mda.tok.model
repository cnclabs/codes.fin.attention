our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by a number of risks and uncertainties  including the following whether we are able to secure sufficient funding to maintain our operations  complete clinical trials and successfully market our product  whether our stock price will enable us to conduct future financings  whether the efficacy  price and timing of our natural human alpha interferon will enable us to compete with other well established  highly capitalized  biopharmaceutical companies  whether clinical testing confirms the efficacy of our product  and results in the receipt of regulatory approvals 
we have not sought the approval of our natural human alpha interferon product from the us food and drug administration or its european union counterparts  except sweden  whether our patent applications result in the issuance of patents  or whether patents and other intellectual property rights provide adequate protections in the event of misappropriation or infringement by third parties  whether our avian transgenics program will succeed in being able to produce targeted drugs in egg whites of transgenic chickens in commercially viable quantities  whether  despite receipt of regulatory approvals  our products are accepted as a treatment superior to that of our competitors  and whether we can generate revenue sufficient to offset our historical losses and achieve profitability 

table of contents our natural human alpha interferon product was developed and is manufactured overseas in our swedish facility 
our avian transgenic and oncology programs are also being researched and developed in europe 
our dependence on foreign manufacturing and expected international sales exposes us to a number of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  including import and export restrictions  political or economic instability  compliance with foreign laws  transportation delays and interruptions  difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights in foreign countries  and currency exchange risks 
viragen has incurred operational losses and operated with negative cash flows since its inception in december net losses have totaled approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  depreciation  amortization  asset valuation allowances  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
inventories 
inventories consist of raw materials and supplies  work in process and finished product 
finished product consists of purified natural human alpha interferon 
raw materials and supplies cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
work in process and finished product costs consisting of raw materials  labor and overhead are recorded at a standard cost which approximates actual cost 
excess idle capacity costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and are recorded in cost of sales 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market estimated net realizable value 
if the cost of our inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on estimates 
the valuation of our inventories also requires us to estimate excess inventories and inventories that are not saleable 
the determination of excess or non saleable inventories requires us to estimate the future demand for our product and consider the shelf life of the inventory 
if actual demand is less than our estimated demand  we could be required to record inventory reserves  which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows 
if these estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
as of the date of these financial statements  we are not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment 

table of contents goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment arise 
all of our goodwill arose from the acquisition of viranative in september and the subsequent achievement of certain milestones defined in the acquisition agreement 
we periodically evaluate that acquired business for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions  and the operational performance of the acquired business 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed our annual impairment review of our goodwill with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
the impairment review indicated that our goodwill was not impaired 
future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including revenue projections or the fair market value of viragen international s common stock  could cause our analysis to indicate that our goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill 
stock based compensation 
our employee stock option plans are accounted for under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant 
in accordance with apb  we recognize no compensation expense for these stock option grants 
we account for our stock based compensation arrangements with non employees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and related guidance  including emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
accordingly  we recognize as expense the estimated fair value of such instruments as calculated using the black scholes valuation model 
the estimated fair value is re determined each quarter using the methodologies allowable by sfas no 
and eitf no 
and the expense is amortized over the vesting period of each option or the recipient s contractual arrangement  if shorter 
convertible debt issued with stock purchase warrants viragen accounts for convertible debt issued with stock purchase warrants in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants  eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  and eitf no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments 
the determination of the relative fair value of the components of our convertible debentures issued with common stock purchase warrants requires the use of estimates 
changes in those estimates would result in different relative values being attributed to the components  which could result in more or less discount on the principal amount of the debentures 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from sales of our natural human alpha interferon product when title and risk of loss has been transferred  which is generally upon shipment 
moreover  recognition requires persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
litigation and other contingencies 
we monitor the status of our litigation and other contingencies for purposes of loss accrual 
if we believed a loss to be probable and reasonably estimated  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we would establish an appropriate accrual 
we would base our accruals on information available at the time of such determination 
information may become available to us after that time  for which additional accruals may be required

table of contents manufacturing of our natural human alpha interferon at our leased facility in umea  sweden  has been suspended since march  this planned break in routine manufacturing was necessary to allow for certain steps of the production process to be segregated and transferred to our owned facility located in ersboda  sweden  which is in the process of being renovated 
renovation of this facility commenced in and is in line with our plan to expand our productive capacity of our natural human alpha interferon 
the estimated total cost of this initial phase is million and it is scheduled to be completed during september as of june   we have invested approximately million on the renovation of this facility and the project is proceeding according to plan 
we believe that our current inventory levels are sufficient to meet our current sales forecasts during the period in which routine production is suspended 
we plan to expand the use of our owned facility in phases based on product demand and available financing 
maximum expansion  if warranted  could cost up to an additional estimated million 
we believe that our natural human alpha interferon product can be manufactured in sufficient quantity and be priced at a level to offer patients an attractive alternative treatment to the synthetic interferons currently being marketed 
however  we can not assure you of the success of our commercialization efforts and other projects 
required regulatory approvals are subject to the successful completion of lengthy and costly clinical trials 
the successful commercialization of multiferon and the completion of required clinical trials and facility expansions depend on our ability to raise significant additional funding 
while subject to significant limitation  at june   we have available approximately million in net tax operating loss carryforwards expiring between and  which may be used to offset taxable income  if any  during those periods 
our ability to generate revenue during future periods is dependent upon obtaining regulatory approvals for commercialization of our different projects 
as we cannot determine that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals  we are unable to conclude that realization of benefits from our deferred tax assets is more likely than not  as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
as a result  we have recognized a valuation allowance to offset of the deferred tax assets related to these carryforwards 
given our current cash on hand  we believe we have the funding necessary to execute our business plan over at least the next months 
these funds will be utilized for expanded marketing efforts of our multiferon product  primarily in europe  continued research in the areas of avian transgenics and oncology and general working capital purposes including administrative support functions

table of contents results of operations compared to product sales product sales for decreased significantly compared to the previous year 
for the fiscal year ended june  product sales totaled approximately  compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  this decrease is primarily due to the absence of sales of bulk interferon product to alfa wasserman under a contractual arrangement which expired in december for the fiscal year ended june   sales to alfa wasserman totaled approximately  we have entered into several agreements for the distribution of our natural human alpha interferon  multiferon  in various countries 
to date  we have not recognized revenue from many of these agreements 
the majority of these agreements require that the distributor obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  which are yet to be obtained 
regulatory approval is a mandatory step in the marketing of a drug  but it is by no means the final challenge in marketing a biopharmaceutical product 
multiferon is a critical care product that is typically administered in a hospital setting 
therefore  in certain instances  it must be part of a hospital s approved formulary to enable physicians to be able to prescribe the product 
this may include becoming approved within a nationalized network of hospitals 
also  the physicians must be educated as to the potential merits and advantages of the product 
there are other challenges associated with international marketing activities including language and cultural barriers  in some cases poorly organized regulatory infrastructure and or compliance procedures in certain countries where multiferon may be marketed  performance of our distribution channels  government s willingness to promote cheaper generic products and the general population s inability to afford private care drug products 
it will take significant time to overcome these challenges with no assurance that a particular market will ever be effectively penetrated 
cost of sales cost of sales and excess idle production costs totaled approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in cost of sales of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   and the resulting negative margins are attributed to excess idle capacity costs 
excess idle capacity costs represent fixed production costs incurred at our swedish manufacturing facility  which were not absorbed as a result of the suspension of routine manufacturing as of march  this planned break in routine manufacturing was necessary to allow for certain steps of our production process to be segregated and transferred to our owned facility located in ersboda  sweden  which is currently being renovated 
we will continue to incur excess idle production costs until we resume production at normal operating levels that absorb our fixed production costs 
research and development costs research and development costs include scientific salaries and support fees  laboratory supplies  consulting fees  contracted research and development  equipment rentals  repairs and maintenance  utilities and research related travel 
for the fiscal year ended june   research and development costs totaled approximately  compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  this increase of approximately  is mainly attributed to costs incurred in the development of potential commercial applications of our natural human alpha interferon product at our scottish facility totaling approximately  also contributing to the increase in research and development were increases related to our avian transgenics project and other research and development costs totaling approximately  and  respectively 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in research and development costs incurred in our oncology projects totaling approximately  our reduction in oncology related research expenditures reflect our decision to focus limited research funding availability to projects believed to be closer to commercialization 

table of contents we will continue incurring research and development costs for additional clinical trial projects associated with multiferon as well as other projects to more fully develop potential commercial applications of our natural human alpha interferon product  as well as broaden our potential product lines in the areas of avian transgenics and oncology 
our ability to successfully conclude additional clinical trials  a prerequisite for expanded commercialization of any product  is dependent upon our ability to raise significant additional funding necessary to conduct and complete these trials

selling  general and administrative expenses totaled approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  this increase of approximately  is mainly attributed to increases in personnel related termination costs  consulting fees  and patent related legal fees at our swedish subsidiary totaling approximately   and  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended june   we also experienced an increase in general corporate legal fees and patent filing fees related to our avian transgenics project totaling approximately  also contributing to the increase were increases in insurance expense and travel related expenses at our florida headquarters totaling approximately  and  respectively 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in personnel related expenses at our florida headquarters totaling approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  we anticipate that selling related expenses will increase significantly in fiscal this increase is expected due to the planned expansion of our multiferon marketing efforts 
these increases will be incurred in marketing personnel related expenses  consulting fees  travel related expenses  promotional materials and other marketing related costs 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the purchase price allocated to separately identified intangible assets obtained in the acquisition of viranative in september the separately identified intangible assets consist of developed technology and a customer contract

the customer contract was amortized over the term of the contract  which expired in december for the fiscal year ended june   amortization of intangible assets totaled approximately  compared to approximately  during the fiscal year ended june  the decrease of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  is primarily the result of the acquired customer contract being fully amortized as of december interest and other income the primary components of interest and other income are interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  grant income from government agencies in scotland  sub lease income on certain office space in our facility in scotland  transaction gains or losses on foreign exchange  gains or losses on the disposal of property  plant and equipment  and income generated from research and development support services provided by our swedish subsidiary

included in interest expense for the fiscal year ended june   is an adjustment to record non cash interest expense totaling approximately million as a result of the revaluation of the warrants issued in connection with the april and june convertible debentures 
at the time of issuance the warrants were valued using their expected lives  which was less than their contractual lives 
ernst young llp  our independent auditors  concurred with this approach 
in january  we were informed by ernst young llp that they had revaluated their interpretation of the accounting literature as it relates to the accounting for common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with financing transactions 
as a result of this subsequent interpretation  we and ernst young llp determined that valuing the warrants issued in connection with our april and june securities purchase agreements using their expected lives was not correct 
by using the expected lives of the warrants  less value was attributed to them than if we had used the contractual lives 
thus  an additional discount of approximately  would have been recorded on the convertible debentures issued under the april and june securities purchase agreements by using the contractual lives on the warrants 
this additional discount associated with the convertible debentures resulted in an understatement of our non cash interest expense of approximately  in the fiscal year ended june  after consideration of all of the facts and circumstances  we recognized the full amount of the prior period non cash interest expense in the quarter ended december   as management believes it is not material to any period affected 
also included in interest expense for the fiscal years ended june  and june  is interest incurred on the debt facilities maintained by our swedish subsidiary totaling approximately  and  respectively 
these credit facilities have interest rates ranging from to 
income tax benefit we are subject to tax in the united states  sweden  and the united kingdom 
these jurisdictions have different marginal tax rates 
for the year ended june   income tax benefit totaled approximately  a decrease of approximately  when compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year as a result of the fully amortized customer contract intangible asset 
income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  consists of the amortization expense on certain intangible assets 
due to the treatment of the identifiable intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  our balance sheet reflects a deferred tax income liability of approximately  as of june   all of which is related to our developed technology intangible asset acquired on september  based on our accumulated losses  a full valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
as of june   we had a net operating loss carry forward of approximately million for us federal income tax purposes 

table of contents compared to product sales as a result of our acquisition of viranative on september   we began recognizing revenue through the sale of our natural human alpha interferon product 
since the date of the acquisition  a significant portion of our product sales have been for the sale of bulk product semi purified to one customer in italy  alfa wasserman  under a contractual arrangement  which has expired 
for the fiscal year ended june   bulk product sales totaled approximately  or approximately of total product sales 
product sales for the nine months ended june  consisted solely of sales of our purified natural human alpha interferon product and we expect to continue selling only purified natural human alpha interferon in the future 
for the fiscal year ended june   product sales totaled approximately  compared to product sales of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in product sales of approximately  for the twelve months ended june  are primarily attributed to the absence of sales of bulk product to alfa wasserman under a contractual arrangement which has expired 
prior year s results of operations for the twelve months ended june  included our swedish subsidiary s results only for the nine months ended june  as it was acquired on september  cost of sales cost of sales and excess idle production costs totaled approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in cost of sales and the resulting negative margins are attributed to excess idle capacity costs 
excess idle capacity costs represent fixed production costs incurred at our swedish manufacturing facility  which were not absorbed as a result of reduced production levels 
research and development costs research and development costs include scientific salaries and support fees  laboratory supplies  consulting fees  contracted research and development  equipment rentals  repairs and maintenance  utilities and research related travel 
research and development costs for the fiscal year ended june  totaled approximately  a decrease of approximately  when compared to the previous fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily attributed to cost reductions in our scottish facility related to the termination of our development efforts on our omniferon product of approximately  and a decrease in consulting fees related to oncology projects totaling approximately  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in contracted research and development totaling approximately  related to our avian transgenics project 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include administrative personnel salaries and related expenses  lease expenses  utilities  repairs and maintenance  insurance  legal  accounting  consulting fees  depreciation and amortization 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to approximately  for the preceding fiscal year 
this increase of  is mainly attributed to additional expenses incurred by our swedish subsidiary of approximately  which was acquired in september prior year s results of operations for the twelve months ended june  included our swedish subsidiary s results only for the nine months ended june  as it was acquired on september  also contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended june  were increases in payroll related expenses  consulting fees  insurance expense and royalties expense at our florida headquarters totaling approximately    and  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal fees at our florida headquarters totaling approximately  this decrease in legal fees reflected the termination of litigation with avigenics conducted primarily in fiscal 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the purchase price allocated to separately identified intangible assets obtained in the acquisition of viranative in september the separately identified intangible assets consist of developed technology and a customer contract 
the developed technology is being amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately years 
the customer contract was amortized over the term of the contract  which expired in december for the fiscal year ended june   amortization of intangible assets totaled approximately  compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  interest and other income the primary components of interest and other income are interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  grant income from a government agency in scotland  sub lease income on certain office space in our facility in scotland and gains or losses on foreign exchange  and gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment 
interest and other income totaled approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of approximately  when compared to the same period of the preceding year 
this increase is attributed to additional grant and sub lease income totaling approximately  and  for the twelve months ended june   respectively 
however  this increase was partially offset by reductions in principal invested between the periods and decreased interest rates available between periods resulting in a decrease in interest income of approximately  and a decrease in gains on foreign exchange totaling approximately  interest expense interest expense for the twelve months ended june  totaling approximately  primarily represents non cash interest expense on our convertible debentures of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  this non cash expense consists of amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of the discounts on the debentures  which arose from detachable warrants and shares of common stock issued with the debentures  as well as the debentures beneficial conversion feature

table of contents research and development projects we have four ongoing research and development projects in the fields of oncology and avian transgenics 
oncological therapies our research and development projects in the field of oncology are focused on the development of therapeutic proteins for the treatment of targeted cancers 
our oncological projects are defined as follow cd therapy in collaboration with cancer research uk  we are developing a monoclonal antibody designed to block the protective effect of the protein cd on the surface of tumor cells 
the protein cd is one of a number of proteins which protect normal healthy cells from being destroyed by the complement system 
the problem arises when cancer cells also express this control protein to camouflage themselves from the immune system at levels up to fold greater than normal 
under a worldwide exclusive commercial license granted to us  we are developing an antibody to remove this protection from tumor cells 
a successful therapy could also offer protection against cancer spreading 
we believe this technology may prove useful in the treatment of colorectal  breast  ovarian and certain bone cancers 
for the fiscal years ended   and  we incurred costs related to the cd project totaling approximately   and  respectively 
since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately  in research and development costs 
in april  our scottish subsidiary  viragen scotland  was awarded a grant from the scottish government for approximately  for the purpose of supporting the cd project 
the cd vaccine project has not reached clinical trials and we do not expect to enter into clinical trials earlier than calendar  if at all 
iep we entered into an agreement with the university of miami s sylvester comprehensive cancer center to develop an anti cancer technology 
the joint project is designed to develop a novel form of an immune enhancing drug that has shown promise by inhibiting tumor growth in rats for a broad range of cancers 
this drug is a novel amino acid peptide called iep  which was derived from a tumor transmembrane glycoprotein 
it possesses anti cancer vaccine properties both prophylactically and therapeutically 
for the fiscal years ended and we incurred costs related to the iep project totaling approximately  and  respectively 
since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately  in research and development costs 
it is too early too determine if and when this project will be considered for clinical trials 
r monoclonal antibody in collaboration with memorial sloan kettering cancer center  we have initiated research on monoclonal antibodies targeting ganglioside gd for the treatment of melanoma and possibly certain other cancers 
monoclonal antibodies are laboratory produced  highly specialized therapeutic proteins designed to locate and bind to targeted cancer cells 
we did not incur any costs related to this project during fiscal for the fiscal years ended and  we incurred costs related to the r project totaling approximately  and  respectively 
since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately  in research and development costs 

table of contents based on ongoing laboratory results  and our recent cost cutting program  further development of this project has been put on hold pending further review of compiled data 
estimated completion dates  completion costs  and future material net cash inflows  if any  for the above oncological projects are not reasonably certain and are not determinable at this time 
the timelines and associated costs for the completion of biopharmaceutical research and product development programs are difficult to accurately predict for various reasons  including the inherent exploratory nature of the work 
the achievement of project milestones is dependent on issues which may impact development timelines and can be unpredictable and beyond viragen s control 
these issues include  availability of capital funding  presence of competing technologies  unexpected experimental results which may cause the direction of research to change  accumulated knowledge about the intrinsic properties of the candidate product  the availability of contract cell banking and manufacturing slots for the preparation of good manufacturing practices grade material  results from preclinical and clinical studies  potential changes in prescribing practice and patient profiles and regulatory requirements 
avian transgenics our avian transgenic project is designed to enable viragen to produce protein based drugs  including monoclonal antibodies  inside the egg whites of transgenic developed chickens 
our goal is to develop a technology which will enable us to meet the large scale production requirements for our own therapeutic protein products 
we also believe that this technology will allow us to offer to others in the biopharmaceutical industry an alternate faster method of production of their protein based products with a higher capacity and at a lower cost 
avian transgenics offers a potential solution to the production bottleneck currently limiting the growth and contributing to the high cost of protein drugs 
existing protein production technologies are often inefficient and costly 
in addition  the anticipated explosion in protein drug approvals together with protein based drugs in pre clinical and phase i or phase ii clinical trials has created a worldwide shortage of production capacity for these protein based products 
we believe our avian transgenics project could offer a rapid and cost effective way to produce large volumes of therapeutic proteins 
in addition to meeting the current and future alternative production demands of the biopharmaceutical industry and generating significant revenue for viragen  this project could also accelerate the progress of several life saving drugs to the market at an affordable cost 
for the fiscal years ended   and  we incurred costs related to the avian transgenics project totaling approximately   and  respectively 
since the date of inception of this project  we have incurred approximately  in research and development costs 
the completion of all of the above research and development projects is dependent upon our ability to raise significant additional funding or our ability to identify potential collaborative partners that would share in project costs 
our future capital requirements are dependent upon many factors  including revenue generated from the sale of our natural human alpha interferon product  progress with future clinical trials  the costs associated with obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in patent applications  competing technologies and market developments  and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and effective commercialization activities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have not traded or otherwise transacted in derivatives nor do we expect to do so in the future 
we have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks which we use in the normal course of our business operations 
interest rate risk the fair value of long term debt is subject to interest rate risk 
while changes in market interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt  we believe a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition  future results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct operations in several different countries 
the balance sheet accounts of our operations in scotland and sweden are translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes and resulting adjustments are made to stockholders equity 
the value of the respective local currency may strengthen or weaken against the us dollar  which would impact the value of stockholders investment in our common stock 
fluctuations in the value of the british pound and swedish krona against the us dollar have occurred during our history  which have resulted in unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and shown in the equity section of our balance sheet 
while most of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in the respective local currency  some transactions are denominated in other currencies 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
upon settlement of this type of transaction  any foreign currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income 
our results of operations may be impacted by the fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies  especially the british pound and swedish krona  in relation to the us dollar 
most of the revenue and expense items of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the respective local currency 
an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower revenue when translated into us dollars 
operating expenses would also be lower in these circumstances 
during the fiscal year ended june   the us dollar has experienced adverse fluctuations against the british pound and the swedish krona 
based on the foreign currency exchange rates as of june   the us dollar has lost approximately and of its value against the british pound and swedish krona  respectively  since june  the weakening of the us dollar has resulted in greater revenues  operating expenses  assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries when translated to us dollars 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities with respect to our foreign currency exposure 
however  we continually monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
we have not incurred significant realized losses on exchange transactions 
if realized losses on foreign transactions were to become significant  we would evaluate appropriate strategies  including the possible use of foreign exchange contracts  to reduce such losses 
we were not adversely impacted by the european union s adoption of the euro currency 
our foreign operations to date have been located in scotland and sweden  which have not participated in the adoption of the euro as of june
