de rl de rl  fastenal singapore pte ltd  fastenal asia pacific  limited  fastco shanghai trading co  ltd  and fastenal europe  bv  collectively  the company began as a partnership in  and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in as of december   the company had  store sites located in states  puerto rico  canada  mexico and singapore and  people employed at these sites 
the company sells industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion 
as of december  these industrial and construction supplies were grouped into ten product lines described further below 
the company operated twelve distribution centers as of december  from which the company distributes products to its store sites  and operates within its indianapolis  indiana facility and operation to receive and distribute products coming from suppliers involved in the company s customer service project csp 
development of the business fastenal company began in with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small  medium sized  and  in subsequent years  large cities 
the company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer its customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of the company s employees 
the company opened its first store site in winona  minnesota  a city with a population of approximately  the following table shows the number of company store sites at the end of each of the last ten years and the related consolidated net sales for each year during the last ten years number of store sites at year end net sales in millions as of december   the company operated store sites in geographic location number united states puerto rico canada mexico singapore the company has closed only ten stores in its history  three of these locations were subsequently reopened when the expansion of the company s product line or the expansion of the company s distribution network improved the profitability of the location 
the company selects new locations for its stores based on their proximity to the company s distribution network  population statistics  and employment data for manufacturing and construction 
the company intends to continue opening new store sites and currently expects the rate of new store openings to be approximately to per year 
the company stocks all new stores with an inventory drawn from all of its product lines 
subsequent to opening  the store personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of its customer base 
the company believes  based on the demographics of the marketplace in the united states and canada  that there is sufficient potential in those two countries to support approximately  total stores 
many of the new store sites would be in cities in which the company currently operates 
the company has not operated outside of the united states and canada long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 
in addition to the stores discussed above  the company also operates in plant sites 
an in plant site is a selling unit located in or near a customer s facility that sells product solely to that customer 
these sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of a store 
the company opened the following store sites  outside the united states  in the last five years puerto rico canada mexico singapore during  the company began operating an in plant site in the dominican republic 
the company plans to open additional store sites in puerto rico  canada  mexico  and singapore in the future 
the store sites located outside the united states contributed less than of the company s consolidated net sales in in addition to operating store sites in mexico  the company also sells products into that country from its existing stores along the border between the united states and mexico 
no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved  or that new stores  once opened  will be profitable 
it has been the company s experience that near term profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store sites  due to the related start up costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base 
a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls  a slow process involving repeated contacts 
as a result of this process  sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires nine to months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month 
of the stores opened in the first quarter of  were profitable in the fourth quarter of for  annual sales volumes of stores operating at least five years ranged between approximately and  with of these stores having annual sales volumes within the range of approximately to  the data in the following table shows the growth in the average sales of the company s stores from to based on the age of each store 
the stores opened in contributed approximately  or approximately of the company s consolidated net sales in  with the remainder coming from store sites opened prior to age of store site as of december  year opened number of store sites in group as of december  average sales average sales percent change year old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old years old the average sales include sales of store sites open for less than the full fiscal year 
the company closed six stores in each group closed one store in  except the group  which closed two stores 
the average is calculated assuming the store number existed half of the year 
as of december   the company operated distribution centers in or near winona  minnesota  indianapolis  indiana  dallas  texas  atlanta  georgia  scranton  pennsylvania  fresno  california  seattle  washington  akron  ohio  salt lake city  utah  winston salem  north carolina  kansas city  kansas  and toronto  ontario 
the toronto facility was added in distribution centers are located so as to permit twice a week to five times a week deliveries to company stores using company trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier 
as the number of stores increases  the company intends to add new distribution centers 
the company also operates a centralized distribution center within the indianapolis  indiana facility 
this facility consolidates inventory for the customer service project csp and ships it to existing stores  for use in conversion to the csp format  and also to new stores 
on august   the company acquired certain assets of two subsidiaries of textron  inc these assets were used in their business of selling packaged fasteners to the retail market do it yourself or diy business 
the diy business was purchased after a prolonged period of contraction  therefore  the historical sales and earnings were not reflective of the diy business s operations at the time it was acquired by the company 
the diy business was subsequently sold to the hillman group  inc on october  the diy business produced net sales of  and  during the approximately nine months and four months  respectively  that it was operated by the company in and or approximately and of total net sales in each year  respectively 
the diy business had facilities in rockford  illinois and goodlettsville  tennessee near nashville 
the company operates a central unix terminal based computer system allowing automatic data exchange between the stores and the distribution centers 
the use of client server technology allows the company s network of unix based machines to serve networked personal computers and workstations 
during the last five years  the company has been converting a portion of this central processing system to a new computer software and operating system and plans to convert additional modules during at the store level  the company operates a proprietary point of sale system 
this system operates on a microsoft windows nt system 
trademarks the company conducts its business in the united states  canada  puerto rico  mexico  and singapore under various trademarks and service marks  including fastenal  fasttool  sharpcut  equiprite  cleanchoice  powerphase  and fastarc 
during and  the company also operated the diy business under the trademarks fas n it and anchor wire 
the anchor wire trademark was sold with the sale of the diy business in october although the company does not believe its operations are substantially dependent upon any of its trademarks or service marks  the company considers its fastenal name and other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to its business 
products the company s original product offering in was fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies  many of which are sold under the fastenal product name 
today  the fastener product line consists of approximately  different stock items 
this product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners  such as bolts  nuts  screws  studs  and related washers  and miscellaneous supplies  such as paints  various pins and machinery keys  concrete anchors  batteries  sealants  metal framing systems  wire rope  strut  private label stud anchors  rivets  and related accessories 
threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects  and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures 
many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities  variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market 
therefore  the company opens each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allows the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 
threaded fasteners accounted for approximately   and of the company s consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the other supply items included in the fastenal product line 
most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as part of the completed anchor assembly 
since  the company added additional product lines 
these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastenal product line 
the additional product lines include the following product line year introduced approximate number of stock items private label product name tools  fasttool cutting tools  sharpcut hydraulics and pneumatics material handling  equiprite janitorial supplies  cleanchoice electrical supplies  powerphase welding supplies  fastarc safety supplies raw materials metals during and  the company sold product in an eleventh product line called retail packaged product 
this product line was added with the acquisition of the diy business 
the diy business was sold in this product line is now included in the other product lines and represents a subset of the type of products included in our csp conversion 
the company does not sell welding gases 
the company plans to add other product lines in the future 
inventory control the company determines its inventory stocking levels through its computer systems  its sales personnel at the store  district  and region level  and its product managers 
the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of company s stores  from individual stores  and from geographic areas  it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information 
the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment  or prompts a buyer to purchase  as necessary based on an established minimum maximum level 
all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers 
inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers 
manufacturing and support services operations in approximately of the company s consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards 
the remaining of the company s consolidated net sales for related to products manufactured  modified or repaired by either the company s manufacturing division or its support services 
the manufactured products consist primarily of non standard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers specifications 
the services provided by the support services group include  but are not limited to  items such as tool repair  band saw blade welding  third party logistics  and light manufacturing 
the company engages in these activities primarily as a service to its customers and expects these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of to of the company s consolidated net sales 
sources of supply the company uses a large number of suppliers for the approximately  standard stock items it distributes 
most items distributed by the company can be purchased from several sources  although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control 
no single supplier accounted for more than of the company s purchases in geographic information information regarding the company s revenues and certain of the company s assets by geographic location is set forth in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in fastenal company s annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended december   which is incorporated herein by reference 
foreign currency fluctuations  changes in trade relations  or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact the company s ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and the company s foreign sales 
customers and marketing the company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer customers in small  medium  and large sized cities a full line of products at convenient locations  and to the high quality of the company s employees 
most of the company s customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets 
the construction market includes general  electrical  plumbing  sheet metal  and road contractors 
the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations 
other users of the company s products include farmers  truckers  railroads  mining companies  federal  state and local governmental entities  schools  and certain retail trades 
as of december   the company s total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last days was approximately  during each of the three years ended december   no one customer accounted for a significant portion of the company s sales 
the company believes that the large number of its customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to the company from economic downturns in a particular market 
store personnel generate a significant portion of the company s sales through direct calls on customers 
because of the nature of the company s business  the company does not use the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television  radio  and newspapers 
forms of advertising used by the company include signs  catalogs  and direct mailings 
competition the company s business is highly competitive 
competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which the company has stores 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for the company s products are customer service and convenience 
some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses  while others rely on mail order or telemarketing sales 
the company  however  believes that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small  medium  and large markets  each offering a wide variety of products  is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area  taken together with the company s ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers  makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products 
having trained personnel at each store also enhances the company s ability to compete see employees below 
employees as of december   the company employed a total of  full and part time employees   being store managers and store employees  and the balance being employed in the company s distribution centers  manufacturing operations  service operations  and home office 
the company believes that the quality of its employees is critical to its ability to compete successfully in the markets it currently serves and to its ability to open new stores in new markets 
the company fosters the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decision making 
wherever possible  promotions are from within the company 
for example  most new store managers are promoted from an assistant manager s position at another store and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 
the company s sales personnel participate in incentive bonus arrangements that place emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis  while still attaining targeted levels of gross profit and collections 
as a result  a significant portion of the company s total employment cost varies with sales volume 
the company also pays incentive bonuses to other personnel for achieving pre determined cost containment goals 
none of the company s employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and the company has experienced no work stoppages 
the company believes its employee relations are excellent
