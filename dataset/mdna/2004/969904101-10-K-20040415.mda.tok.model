item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal  we delivered the highest pre tax operating margin and diluted earnings per share in our history  increased our return on assets and repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock 
our net revenues for fiscal increased to billion and diluted earnings per share increased by to 
operationally in fiscal  we deepened our commitment to multi channel retailing by launching our newest concept  pbteen  in both the catalog and e commerce website channels generating approximately million in revenues in ten months of operations  and by expanding our west elm concept into both the retail and e commerce website channels 
we improved our supply chain cost structure and continued to invest in the infrastructure and systems necessary to drive future operational efficiencies 
to support the growth in our core brands and to prepare for the expected growth in our new and emerging brands pbteen  hold everything  west elm  and williams sonoma home  we increased our distribution square footage by approximately and upgraded our distribution operating systems 
in fiscal  we will continue to engineer our businesses around the three key strategic initiatives that have driven our financial performance over the last several years increasing profitable top line sales growth  increasing our pre tax operating margin as a percentage of sales  and delivering consistent and predictable earnings to our shareholders 
to drive profitable top line sales growth in our core brands  we expect to increase our store leased square footage by approximately to driven by the opening of new stores  the remodeling of stores  and the closure of permanent or remodeled stores  increase catalog circulation  expand customer contacts through electronic direct marketing  and intensify the marketing support behind our bridal and gift registry businesses 
on the operational side of the business  we expect to increase our order fulfillment rates in the direct to customer channel and reduce customer return rates 
in our emerging brands pbteen  hold everything  west elm  and williams sonoma home  we are focused on enhancing brand awareness and customer access to the brands 
to achieve these initiatives we plan to identify new customers  increase catalog circulation  including the launch of our newest catalog  williams sonoma home  expand the use of electronic direct marketing  launch a hold everything e commerce website  and add three new retail locations in the second half of the year two in west elm and one in hold everything 
the williams sonoma home catalog is expected to be introduced in the third quarter of fiscal replacing our existing chambers catalog  and the hold everything e commerce website is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal to support all of these brand building initiatives  we will be continuing to invest in our long term infrastructure  including increasing distribution capacity and implementing new information technology 
although these investments are being made in advance of the revenue stream  their impact on earnings is more than offset by our continued ability to drive greater efficiencies in our existing supply chain operations and overhead cost structure 
although we are committed to our key strategic initiatives  there are inherent risks associated with our business and the retail industry as a whole that may present challenges for us in the future 
we have outlined these risks within the risk factors section of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k

we expect comparable store sales for pottery barn kids stores in multi store markets to remain volatile during the growth phase of the concept  consistent with our experience in the early years of the pottery barn store rollout

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues and the related cost of goods sold including shipping costs at the time the products are received by customers in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized for retail sales excluding home delivered merchandise at the point of sale in the store and for home delivered merchandise and direct to customer sales when the merchandise is delivered to the customer 
based on historical experience developed by concept and by channel  we record a reserve for estimated product returns in each reporting period 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customer are recognized as revenue at the time the products are delivered to the customer 
sales return reserve our customers may return purchased items for an exchange or refund 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance 
if actual returns are different than those projected by management  the estimated sales return reserve will be adjusted accordingly 
property and equipment depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the decision to close  relocate  remodel or expand a store prior to the end of its lease term can result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life of the long lived assets 
for any early store closures where a lease obligation still exists  we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the date the store is closed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

table of contents we review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review for impairment all stores for which current cash flows from operations are negative or the construction costs are significantly in excess of the amount originally expected 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is based upon our experience  historical operations of the stores  estimates of future store profitability and economic conditions 
the amount recorded for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value is estimated based upon future cash flows discounted at our weighted average cost of capital

 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  however  requires the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share as if we had adopted the fair value method 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of stock based awards to employees is calculated through the use of option pricing models 
these models require subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise  which affect the calculated values 
our calculations are based on a single option valuation approach and forfeitures are recognized as they occur 
inventory reserves merchandise inventories  net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence  are stated at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
we estimate a provision for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory based on inventory aging reports and specific identification 
we reserve  based on inventory aging reports  for of the cost of all inventory between one and two years old and of the cost of all inventory over two years old 
if actual obsolescence is different from our estimate  we will adjust our provision accordingly 
specific reserves are recorded in the event the cost of the inventory exceeds the fair market value 
in addition  on a monthly basis  we estimate a reserve for expected shrinkage at the concept and channel level based on historical shrinkage factors and our current inventory levels 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based on the results of our physical inventory count 
catalog amortization prepaid catalog expenses consist of third party incremental direct costs  including creative design  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs for all of our direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of actual revenues to the total of actual and estimated future revenues on an individual catalog basis 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability on a monthly basis by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future profitability net sales less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog completion costs associated with that catalog 
if the catalog is not expected to be profitable  the carrying amount of the catalog is impaired accordingly 
self insured liabilities we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and product and general liability insurance 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed  including the development of those claims  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors affecting this estimate include future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs  and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of

if any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans  projections and other forward looking statements included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings 
in addition  if any of the following risks and uncertainties  or if any other disclosed risks and uncertainties  actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline  perhaps significantly 
we must successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends  and manage our inventory commensurate with customer demand 
our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trends and customer demands in a timely manner 
consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and may change between sales seasons 
if we misjudge either the market for our merchandise or our customers purchasing habits  our sales may decline significantly  and we may be required to mark down certain products to sell the resulting excess inventory or sell such inventory through our outlet stores  or other liquidation channels  at prices which are significantly lower than our retail prices  each of which would harm our business and operating results 
in addition  we must manage our inventory effectively and commensurate with customer demand 
much of our inventory is sourced from vendors located outside the us thus  we usually must order merchandise  and enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of such merchandise  well in advance of the applicable selling season and frequently before trends are known 
the extended lead times for many of our purchases may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing trends 
in addition  the seasonal nature of the specialty home products business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory prior to peak selling season 
as a result  we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to misjudgments in the selection and timing of merchandise purchases 
if we do not accurately predict our customers preferences and acceptance levels of our products  our inventory levels will not be appropriate  and our business and operating results may be negatively impacted 
our business depends  in part  on factors affecting consumer spending that are out of our control 
our business depends on consumer demand for our products and  consequently  is sensitive to a number of factors that influence consumer spending  including general economic conditions  disposable consumer income  recession and fears of recession  war and fears of war  inclement weather  consumer debt  interest rates  sales tax rates and rate increases  consumer confidence in future economic conditions and political conditions  and consumer perceptions of personal well being and security generally 
adverse changes in factors affecting discretionary consumer spending could reduce consumer demand for our products  thus reducing our sales and harming our business and operating results

table of contents we face intense competition from companies with brands or products similar to ours 
the specialty retail and direct to customer business is highly competitive 
our specialty retail stores  mail order catalogs and e commerce websites compete with other retail stores  other mail order catalogs and other e commerce websites that market lines of merchandise similar to ours 
we compete with national  regional and local businesses utilizing a similar retail store strategy  as well as traditional furniture stores  department stores and specialty stores 
the substantial sales growth in the direct to customer industry within the last decade has encouraged the entry of many new competitors and an increase in competition from established companies 
the competitive challenges facing us include anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands better than our competitors  maintaining favorable brand recognition and achieving customer perception of value  effectively marketing and competitively pricing our products to consumers in several diverse market segments  and developing innovative  high quality products in colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes  and in ways that favorably distinguish us from our competitors 
in light of the many competitive challenges facing us  we may not be able to compete successfully 
increased competition could adversely affect our sales  operating results and business 
we depend on key domestic and foreign vendors for timely and effective sourcing of our merchandise  and we are subject to various risks and uncertainties that might affect our vendors ability to produce quality merchandise 
our performance depends on our ability to purchase our merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices 
we purchase our merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers 
we have no contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products  and any vendor could discontinue selling to us at any time 
we may not be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the future 
any inability to acquire suitable merchandise or the loss of one or more key vendors could have a negative effect on our business and operating results because we would be missing products that we felt were important to our assortment  unless and until alternative supply arrangements are secured 
we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors  and products from alternative sources  if any  may be of a lesser quality and or more expensive than those we currently purchase 
in addition  we are subject to certain risks  including availability of raw materials  labor disputes  union organizing activity  inclement weather  natural disasters  and general economic and political conditions  that might limit our vendors ability to provide us with quality merchandise on a timely basis 
for these or other reasons  one or more of our vendors might not adhere to our quality control standards  and we might not identify the deficiency before merchandise ships to our stores or customers 
our vendors failure to manufacture or import quality merchandise in a timely and effective manner could damage our reputation and brands  and could lead to an increase in customer litigation against us and an attendant increase in our routine litigation costs 
our dependence on foreign vendors subjects us to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
we source our products from manufacturers in countries outside of the us specifically  in fiscal  approximately of our merchandise purchases were foreign sourced  primarily from asia and europe 
our dependence on foreign vendors means  in part  that we may be affected by declines in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies 
although substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars  declines in foreign currencies and currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of one or more of our foreign vendors 
this  in turn  might cause such foreign vendors to demand higher prices for merchandise  
table of contents hold up merchandise shipments to us  or discontinue selling to us  any of which could ultimately reduce our sales or increase our costs 
we are also subject to other risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries 
these risks and uncertainties include import duties and quotas  concerns over anti dumping  work stoppages  economic uncertainties including inflation  foreign government regulations  wars and fears of war  political unrest and other trade restrictions 
we cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments or the likelihood  type or effect of any such restrictions 
any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign vendors  including the imposition of additional import restrictions  restrictions on the transfer of funds and or increased tariffs or quotas  or both  against home centered items could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  some or all of our foreign vendors operations may be adversely affected by political and financial instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries  restrictions on the transfer of funds and or other trade disruptions 
in addition  although we are in the process of implementing an enhanced global compliance program  there remains a risk that one or more of our foreign vendors will not adhere to our global compliance standards such as fair labor standards and the prohibition on child labor 
non governmental organizations might attempt to create an unfavorable impression of our sourcing practices or the practices of some of our vendors that could harm our image 
if either of these occurs  we could lose customer goodwill and favorable brand recognition  which could negatively affect our business and operating results 
the growth of our sales and profits depends  in large part  on our ability to successfully open new stores 
in each of the past three fiscal years  our retail stores have generated approximately of our net revenues 
we expect an increase of approximately new and remodeled retail stores in fiscal as part of our growth strategy 
there is no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
our ability to open additional stores successfully will depend upon a number of factors  including our identification and availability of suitable store locations  our success in negotiating leases on acceptable terms  our ability to secure required governmental permits and approvals  our hiring and training of skilled store operating personnel  especially management  our timely development of new stores  including the availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction and other delays in store openings  the availability of financing on acceptable terms if at all  and general economic conditions 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
for example  for the purpose of identifying suitable store locations  we rely  in part  on demographics surveys regarding location of consumers in our target market segments 
while we believe that the surveys and other relevant information are helpful indicators of suitable store locations  we recognize that the information sources cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy 
in addition  time frames for lease negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays 
construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results 
we may not be able to open new stores or  if opened  operate those stores profitably 
we must timely and effectively deliver merchandise to our stores and customers 
we cannot control all of the various factors that might affect our fulfillment rates in direct to customer sales and or timely and effective merchandise delivery to our stores 
we rely upon third party carriers for our merchandise shipments and the reliable data regarding the timing of those shipments  including shipments to our customers and to and from all of our stores 
accordingly  we are subject to the risks  
form k side tag 

table of contents including labor disputes such as the west coast port strike of  union organizing activity  inclement weather  natural disasters  and possible acts of terrorism associated with such carriers ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs 
failure to deliver merchandise in a timely and effective manner could damage our reputation and brands 
in addition  we are seeing fuel costs increase substantially and airline companies struggle to operate profitably  which could lead to increased fulfillment expenses 
the increased fulfillment costs could negatively affect our business and operating results by increasing our transportation costs and  therefore  decreasing the efficiency of our shipments 
our failure to successfully manage our order taking and fulfillment operations might have a negative impact on our business 
the operation of our direct to customer business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our order taking and fulfillment operations and our e commerce websites 
disruptions or slowdowns in these areas could result from disruptions in telephone service or power outages  inadequate system capacity  human error  natural disasters or adverse weather conditions 
these problems could result in a reduction in sales as well as increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  we face the risk that we cannot hire enough qualified employees  especially during our peak season  to support our direct to customer operations  due to war or other circumstances that reduce the relevant workforce 
the need to operate with fewer employees could negatively impact our customer service levels and our operations 
we experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to increase sales at our existing stores 
various factors affect comparable store sales  including the number of stores we open  close and expand in any period  the general retail sales environment  changes in sales mix between distribution channels  our ability to efficiently source and distribute products  changes in our merchandise mix  competition  current economic conditions  the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events  the success of marketing programs  and the cannibalization of existing store sales by new stores 
among other things  weather conditions can affect comparable store sales  because inclement weather can require us to close certain stores temporarily and thus reduce store traffic 
even if stores are not closed  many customers may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather 
these factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from earnings guidance we have provided 
our comparable store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual  quarterly and monthly basis  and we expect that comparable store sales will continue to fluctuate in the future 
our comparable store sales increases for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
past comparable store sales are no indication of future results  and comparable store sales may decrease in the future 
our ability to maintain and improve our comparable store sales results depends in large part on maintaining and improving our forecasting of customer demand and buying trends  selecting effective marketing techniques  providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base and using more effective pricing strategies 
any failure to meet the comparable store sales expectations of investors and security analysts in one or more future periods could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock 
our failure to successfully manage the costs and performance of our catalog mailings might have a negative impact on our business 
postal rate increases  paper  printing costs and other catalog distribution costs affect the cost of our catalog mailings 
we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure  such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes 
our cost of paper has fluctuated significantly during the past three fiscal years  and our paper costs may increase in the future 
although we have entered into long term contracts for catalog paper and catalog printing  these contracts offer no assurance that our catalog 
table of contents production costs will not substantially increase following expiration of the contracts 
future increases in postal rates  paper or printing costs would have a negative impact on our operating results to the extent that we are unable to pass such increases on directly to customers or offset such increases by raising selling prices or by implementing more efficient printing  mailing  delivery and order fulfillment systems 
we have historically experienced fluctuations in customer response to our catalogs 
customer response to our catalogs is substantially dependent on merchandise assortment  merchandise availability and creative presentation  as well as the sizing and timing of delivery of the catalogs 
environmental organizations may attempt to create an unfavorable impression of our paper use in catalogs 
the failure to effectively produce or distribute the catalogs could affect the timing of catalog delivery  which could cause customers to forego or defer purchases 
we must successfully manage our internet business 
the success of our internet business depends  in part  on factors over which we have limited control 
in addition to changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to internet usage  we are vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with the internet  including changes in required technology interfaces  website downtime and other technical failures  changes in applicable federal and state regulation  security breaches  and consumer privacy concerns 
our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our internet business  as well as damage our reputation and brands 
our failure to successfully anticipate merchandise returns might have a negative impact on our business 
we record a reserve for merchandise returns based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance in each reporting period 
if actual returns are greater than those projected by management  additional sales returns might be recorded in the future 
actual merchandise returns may exceed our reserves 
in addition  the introduction of new merchandise  changes in merchandise mix  changes in consumer confidence  or other competitive and general economic conditions may cause actual returns to exceed merchandise return reserves 
any significant increase in merchandise returns that exceeds our reserves could materially affect our business and operating results 
we must successfully manage the complexities associated with a multi channel and multi brand business 
during the past few years  with the launch and expansion of our internet business  new brands and brand expansions  our overall business has become substantially more complex 
the changes in our business have forced us to develop new expertise and face new challenges  risks and uncertainties 
for example  we face the risk that our internet business might cannibalize a significant portion of our retail and catalog businesses 
while we recognize that our internet sales cannot be entirely incremental to sales through our retail and catalog channels  we seek to attract as many new customers as possible to our e commerce websites 
we continually analyze the business results of our three channels and the relationships among the channels  in an effort to find opportunities to build incremental sales 
however  we cannot ensure that  as our internet business grows  it will not cannibalize a portion of our retail and catalog businesses 
we may not be able to introduce new brands and brand extensions that improve our business 
we have recently introduced two new brands  pbteen and west elm  and expect to introduce additional new brands such as williams sonoma home and brand extensions in the future 
if we devote time and resources to new brands and brand extensions  and those businesses are not as successful as we planned  then we risk damaging our overall business results 
alternatively  if our new brands and brand extensions prove to be very successful  we risk hurting our existing brands through the potential migration of existing brand customers to the new businesses 
we may not be able to introduce new brands and brand extensions that improve our overall business and operating results

table of contents our inability to obtain commercial insurance at acceptable prices might have a negative impact on our business 
during fiscal  the increase in the cost of insurance moderated 
however  insurance costs continue to be volatile  affected by natural catastrophes  fear of terrorism and financial irregularities and other fraud at publicly traded companies 
we believe that commercial insurance coverage is prudent for risk management and insurance costs may increase substantially in the future 
in addition  for certain types or levels of risk  such as risks associated with earthquakes or terrorist attacks  we might determine that we cannot obtain commercial insurance at acceptable prices 
therefore  we might choose to forego or limit our purchase of relevant commercial insurance  choosing instead to self insure one or more types or levels of risks 
if we suffer a substantial loss that is not covered by commercial insurance  the loss and attendant expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our inability or failure to protect our intellectual property would have a negative impact on our business 
our trademarks  service marks  copyrights  patents  trade dress rights  trade secrets  domain names and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could diminish the value of our brands or goodwill and cause a decline in our sales 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property 
in addition  the costs of defending our intellectual property may adversely affect our operating results 
we have been sued and may be named in additional lawsuits in a growing number of industry wide patent litigation cases relating to the internet 
there appears to be a growing number of patent infringement lawsuits instituted against companies such as ours that have an internet business 
the plaintiff in each case claims to hold a patent that covers certain website technology  which is allegedly infringed by the operation of the defendants e commerce websites 
we are currently a defendant in one such patent infringement case and anticipate being named in others in the future  as part of an industry wide trend 
even in cases where a plaintiff s claim lacks merit  the defense costs in a patent infringement case are very high 
additional patent infringement claims may be brought against us  and the cost of defending such claims or the ultimate resolution of such claims may harm our business and operating results 
we need to manage our employment  occupancy and other operating costs 
to be successful  we need to manage our operating costs while we continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs 
we recognize that we may need to increase the number of our employees  especially in peak sales seasons  and incur other expenses to support new brands and brand extensions  as well as the opening of new stores and direct to customer growth of our existing brands 
in addition  although we strive to secure long term contracts with our service providers and other vendors and otherwise limit our financial commitment to them  we may not be able to avoid unexpected operating cost increases in the future 
lower than expected sales  coupled with higher than expected costs  would negatively impact our business and operating results 
we are planning certain systems changes that might disrupt our supply chain operations 
our success depends on our ability to source merchandise efficiently through appropriate systems and procedures 
we are in the process of substantially modifying our information technology systems supporting the product pipeline  including design  sourcing  merchandise planning  forecasting and purchase order  inventory  distribution  transportation and price management 
modifications will involve updating or replacing legacy systems with successor systems during the course of several years 
there are inherent risks associated with replacing our core systems  including supply chain disruptions that affect our ability to get products into our stores and delivered to customers 
we may not successfully launch these new systems or 
table of contents the launch may result in supply chain disruptions 
any resulting supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our operating and financial performance in any given period might not meet the extensive guidance that we have provided to the public 
we provide extensive public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods 
although we believe that this guidance fosters confidence among investors and analysts  and is useful to our shareholders and potential shareholders  such guidance is comprised of forward looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements 
we cannot ensure that our guidance will always be accurate 
if in the future our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts  the market price of our common stock could decline 
our quarterly results of operations might fluctuate due to a variety of factors including seasonality 
our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future  depending upon a variety of factors  including  but not limited to shifts in the timing of holiday selling seasons  including valentine s day  easter  halloween  thanksgiving and christmas  and the strategic importance of fourth quarter results 
a significant portion of our revenues and net earnings have been realized during the period from october through december 
in anticipation of increased holiday sales activity  we incur certain significant incremental expenses  including the hiring of a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement our existing workforce 
if  for any reason  we were to realize significantly lower than expected revenues or net earnings during the october through december selling season  our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
we depend on external funding sources for operating funds 
we regularly review and evaluate our liquidity and capital needs 
we currently believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and cash available under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to finance our operations and expected capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  as we continue to grow  we might experience peak periods for our cash needs during the course of our fiscal year  and we might need additional external funding to support our operations 
although we believe we would have access to additional debt and or capital market funding if needed  such funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms 
if the cost of such funds is greater than expected  it could adversely affect our expenses and our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the interest payable on our bank line of credit and on two of our operating leases is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt and operating leases rose basis points an approximate increase in the associated variable rates as of february   our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
for one of the operating leases with a variable interest rate at february   we have an interest rate cap contract at with a notional amount as of february  of  which extends through february the contract has not been designated as a hedge and is accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of the contract to market 
any gain or loss associated with this contract was recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses and was not material to us in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal 
form k side tag 

table of contents in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase in interest rates of would have an immaterial effect on the value of these investments 
declines in interest rates would  however  decrease the income derived from these investments 
foreign currency risks we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of february   any currency risks related to these transactions were not significant to us 
a decline in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased purchasing costs 
as of february   we have retail stores in canada  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
as necessary  we utilize day foreign currency contracts to minimize any currency remeasurement risk associated with intercompany assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiary 
these contracts are accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of the contract to market and recognizing any gain or loss in selling  general and administrative expenses in each reporting period 
we did not enter into any new contracts during fiscal any gain or loss associated with these contracts in prior years was not material to us
