when a lease expires  we generally renew that lease at current market terms 
however  each renewal is based upon an analysis of the individual store s profitability and sales potential

comparable store sales for fiscal were calculated by excluding sales during the last week of fiscal a week year in order to make fiscal comparable to fiscal comparable store sales are defined as sales in stores that were open at least months 
the zutopia division was designated as a discontinued operation which had an insignificant impact to the comparable store sales 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties  and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the heading statement regarding forward looking disclosure and risk factors included elsewhere in this form k 
current trends and outlook lower than expected sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal were a disappointment  given the progressively improving sales trend seen through the third quarter of fiscal the comparable store sales decrease in the fourth quarter was due to declining transaction counts  primarily in the wet seal division  which was a direct reflection of our inability to provide the fashions needed to win back our core customer 
we believe that our december product was too holiday specific  and did not provide enough transitional styles to lead us into the pre spring months 
in january we were not prepared for the continued cold weather in some parts of the country  and we did not have enough sweaters and jackets to adequately re supply the stores 
in addition  in january  the average dollar sale in the stores were depressed downward by the many promotions in place to move the goods remaining from the holiday season 
we believe that our available cash and investments aggregating million at january  and other working capital and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for the next months 
however  we believe that if our sales do not improve  we may not be able to finance our inventory purchases pursuant to letters of credit issued under our existing bank credit facility  but instead may be required to obtain alternative financing at significantly higher costs 
at the end of fiscal  we had working capital of million  including cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
this compares with working capital of million  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at the end of fiscal the primary reason for these decreases is our loss from continuing operations of million for fiscal see liquidity and capital resources 
during the past six months we have been focused on rebuilding an effective team for the wet seal brand and  in doing so  we have completely rebuilt our management structure 
after the addition of our new chief executive officer who joined in july  many key management changes were made in strategic areas to assemble and build the creative  buying and planning teams necessary to execute the successful selection and presentation of fashion to gain consumer acceptance 
a key strategy was the decision to hire an in house designer for the wet seal division in order to have more control over our fashions and to develop more unique clothing 
these individuals are highly qualified for the positions for which they were hired and bring with them extensive cross functional management skills 
we believe that the benefits of these strategic efforts will begin to be seen with the wet seal customer during the back to school season 
the performance of the arden b 
division gained momentum during the year with sequential improvement in comparable store sales each quarter resulting in comparable stores sales increases in the third and fourth quarters with corresponding increases in transaction counts and average unit retails 
we attribute these results to our efforts to refocus on a more sophisticated offering 
we concentrated on fashion jackets  coats  outerwear and cashmere sweaters 
arden b 
has also delivered a fresh new gift giving assortment of handbags and accessories that is adding to the complete wardrobe of their target customer 
we believe that our inventory position is good as we head into the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the aggressive markdowns taken in the wet seal division in the fourth quarter of fiscal while we are evaluating our cost structure  we are continuing to make prudent investments in our management team in order to rebuild the wet seal business 
cost saving initiatives are also under way to reduce selling  general and administrative and distribution costs 
during fiscal  we intend to scale back the number of new store openings to approximately new locations  consisting of six wet seal locations and four arden b 
locations 
total capital expenditures anticipated for fiscal are expected to be less than million 
this capital expenditure estimate includes the anticipated costs of renovating stores  the leases for which will be renewed this year 
the company will record a reserve in the first and second quarters of for all applicable charges associated with the closure of the zutopia stores which primarily includes the buyout of leases 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
our accounting policies are set forth further in note of the consolidated financial statements included herein 
inventory valuation  recovery of deferred tax and long lived assets require significant management judgments and estimates 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
cost is calculated using the retail inventory method 
the retail inventory method is used to estimate the ending inventory at cost by employing a cost to retail selling price ratio 
the ending inventory is first determined at selling price and then converted to cost 
purchases  sales  net markdowns less mark ups  charitable donations of merchandise  discounts and estimated shrink are considered in arriving at the cost to retail ratio 
inventories include items that have been marked down to management s best estimate of their fair market value 
management s decision to mark down merchandise is based on maintaining the freshness of our product offering 
markdowns are taken regularly to effect the rapid sale of slow moving inventory and to make room for new merchandise arriving daily in the stores 
to the extent that management s estimates of markdowns necessary to rapidly sell inventory differ from actual results  additional markdowns may be required that could reduce our gross margin  operating income and the carrying value of inventories 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate the changing fashion tastes of our customers and to respond to those changing tastes in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changing styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we may experience lower sales  excess inventories and more frequent and extensive markdowns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  respectively  included herein 
long lived assets during the normal course of business  we acquire tangible long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of these assets 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairments are recognized in operating income as they are realized 
management uses its best judgment  based upon the most current facts and circumstances surrounding the specific assets  when applying these impairment rules 
changes in the assumptions used could have a significant impact on management s assessments of the recoverability 
many factors  including changes to the company s business and consumer preferences  could significantly impact management s decision to retain or dispose of certain of its long lived assets 
deferred income taxes we evaluate the reliability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance is based upon our expectations of future taxable income and the ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies available to us 
in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged against income in the period such determination is made 
results of operations except as otherwise noted  the following discussion of our financial position and results of operations excludes our discontinued zutopia division  which is expected to be closed by the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter of fiscal the following table sets forth selected income statement data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal year indicated 
the discussion that follows should be read in conjunction with the table below as a percentage of sales fiscal year ended fiscal year fiscal year ended january  february  february  net sales cost of sales including buying  merchandise planning  distribution and occupancy costs gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest income  net income before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales change from prior fiscal year in millions net sales comparable store sales percentage the decrease in sales in fiscal was due to the comparable store sales decline of compared to a comparable store sales decrease of in fiscal the overall decline in comparable store sales was due to a reduction in the number of transactions per store  a lower average dollar sale  and a reduction in the average unit retail price compared to the prior year 
the average dollar sale in the stores was driven downward by the many promotions put in place in reaction to slow selling merchandise 
the average unit retail declined as a result of the aggressive markdowns taken during the year as well as deterioration in the initial markup after allowances  primarily in our wet seal division 
cost of sales including buying  merchandise planning allocation  distribution and occupancy change from prior fiscal year in millions cost of sales including buying  merchandise planning allocation  distribution and occupany percent of net sales our cost of sales  in addition to the direct merchandise cost  also includes our buying  merchandise planning allocation  distribution and occupancy costs 
the increase as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of several key factors the merchandise cost portion of cost of sales represented approximately of the total increase 
this increase was primarily the result of a significant increase in the amount of goods sold at markdown prices  and also includes a substantial markdown reserve at year end to reduce the value of remaining inventory 
in addition  the initial mark up of selected merchandise was lower  contributing to a lower merchandise margin  which translated into more merchandise cost as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year 
because of lower sales  occupancy  buying and merchandise planning allocation costs as a percentage of sales impacted the margin by almost compared to the prior year 
additionally  the buying and merchandise planning allocation costs increased slightly over the prior year due to our investment in buying and merchandise planning allocation management as a strategic objective to revitalize the wet seal division 
slightly offsetting these increases  our distribution center costs decreased  reflecting greater efficiencies developed over the past year 
selling  general and administrative expenses change from prior fiscal year in millions selling  general administrative expenses percent of net sales our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised of two components 
the selling expense component includes store and field support costs including personnel  advertising  and merchandise delivery costs as well as internet catalog processing costs 
the general and administrative g a expense component includes the cost of corporate functions such as legal  accounting  information systems  human resources  real estate  and other centralized services 
the sg a expense included the following store payroll as a percentage of sales increased 
the level of actual payroll dollars spent per store during fiscal was almost flat compared to fiscal  due to the tightening of store payroll hours in concert with lower sales per store  but was higher as a percentage of sales due to same store sales decline 
other selling related expenses decreased primarily by eliminating catalog distribution in fiscal  by reducing advertising expenditures  and by achieving lower merchandise delivery costs using ground freight to the stores rather than air freight 
g a expenses declined compared to the prior year as the prior year expenses included a one time million reserve established for a settlement with the previous chief executive officer 
however  in fiscal  there was a one time million net charge for the settlement of and the legal fees associated with previously employed store managers who alleged non exempt pay status under california state labor laws 
lower employee benefit costs in fiscal associated with reductions in retirement plan costs and in accrued bonus expense compared to the prior year 
net interest income change from prior fiscal year in millions net interest income percent of net sales the decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in the invested balance compared to the prior year 
total cash and investments were million at the end of fiscal compared to million at the end of fiscal in addition  there was a reduction in market interest rates on the invested balance 
income taxes change from prior fiscal year in millions income taxes provision benefit effective tax rate the income tax benefit of million for fiscal compares to a million provision for fiscal  reflecting a benefit on pre tax losses this year compared to a charge on pre tax income last year 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was and for fiscal discontinued operations discontinued operations is comprised of two components  the net loss from the zutopia division operations for the year  net of income taxes  and the loss on disposal  net of income taxes  which is derived from the million pre tax write off of the zutopia assets 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales change from prior fiscal year in millions net sales comparable store sales percentage comparable store sales decreased for fiscal compared to an increase of for fiscal the comparable store sales decrease reflected the negative sales trends in the second half of fiscal  in which we did not have a dominant fashion trend to drive sales as compared to fiscal sales in the first half of fiscal were fueled by the bohemian trend 
as the bohemian trend waned during the period leading up to the back to school season  we replaced it with a more sophisticated product offering 
cost of sales including buying  merchandise planning allocation  distribution and occupancy change from prior fiscal year in millions cost of sales including buying  merchandise planning allocation  distribution and occupany percent of net sales our cost of sales  which encompasses merchandise cost  also includes our buying  merchandise planning allocation  distribution and occupancy costs 
the increase as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the following factors the increase in cost of sales as a percent of sales for fiscal was driven by an increase in markdowns and in shrink  offset partially by a slight improvement in the cumulative mark up 
the increased markdowns in the third and fourth quarters were the result of reacting to the declining comparable store sales  and included a substantial markdown reserve at year end to reduce the value of inventory subsequently marked out of stock in february in addition  the de leverage stemming from negative comparable store sales caused fixed costs such as buying  distribution and occupancy to rise as a percentage of sales in fiscal versus fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses change from prior fiscal year in millions selling  general administrative expenses percent of net sales our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised of two components 
the selling expense component includes store and field support related costs including personnel  advertising  and merchandise delivery costs  as well as internet catalog processing costs 
the general and administrative g a expense component includes the cost of corporate functions such as legal  accounting  information systems  human resources  real estate  and other centralized services 
the increase in sg a expenses are as follows the increase in selling expenses was primarily due to higher store wages and benefits 
this was due to supporting more stores as well as actions taken early in the year to improve the quality and therefore the average salary of many of the store level employees 
the catalog business also contributed to higher selling expenses for the promotion  production and distribution support costs  reflecting our entry into the catalog business in fiscal we invested more in advertising costs in fiscal to support the retail locations 
selling expenses rose  as a percent of sales  due to de leveraging of fixed costs caused by lower sales per store than in the same stores in the prior year 
the increase was primarily caused by a reserve established for costs relating to a settlement with the prior chief executive officer 
the remaining increase was due to central office payrolls  reflecting salary increases and an increase in the number of employees 
these increases were offset partially by savings in legal fees incurred in negotiating store leases  as a result of establishing an in house legal department 
net interest income change from prior fiscal year in millions net interest income percent of net sales the decrease in the net interest income was due to a reduction in market interest rates on the invested balances  as well as a decrease later in the year in the amount invested 
total cash and investments were million at the end of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal income taxes change from prior fiscal year in millions income taxes provision effective tax rate the decrease in the effective tax rate reflected the net loss during the fourth quarter  which increased the proportion of the full year net income that was in the form of tax exempt interest  as well as the proportion of income offset by charitable deductions of merchandise 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities for continuing operations was million for fiscal  compared to million net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal fiscal operating cash flows were directly impacted by our loss from continuing operations of million  partially offset by non cash charges depreciation  amortization and disposal expense  stock compensation and deferred taxes of million and a net increase in the cash components of our working capital of approximately million 
the fiscal changes in the cash components of working capital included a million decrease in receivables  principally due to the reduction of tenant allowances resulting from less construction of new and remodeled stores  a reduction of million in prepaid accounts primarily prepaid rents  a million decrease in merchandise and other payables  and a million increase in income tax payable 
merchandise inventory decreased by million 
cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal included the net sales of marketable securities of million offset by capital expenditures of million 
cash provided by financing activities of million due to the exercise of stock options of million  offset by million paid to repurchase of company stock earlier in the year 
net cash used in discontinued operations for the zutopia division in fiscal was million  which included the division s loss of million  largely offset by non cash charges of million  a net increase in the cash components of our working capital of approximately million  and capital expenditures of million 
the cash and investment balance for the fiscal year was million  million less than at the end of fiscal this change resulted from the decline in sales and the resulting use of cash described above 
in fiscal and  we invested million and million  respectively  in property and equipment and leasehold improvements for continuing operations 
these expenditures related primarily to new store openings and remodels 
in fiscal for continuing operations  we opened stores and remodeled stores 
in fiscal for continuing operations  we opened stores and remodeled stores 
there were no acquisitions in either fiscal year 
capital expenditures for fiscal are currently projected to be million or less  relating primarily to new store openings and remodels 
our working capital at january  was million compared to million at february  the overall reduction in our working capital primarily reflects cash used in the continuing operations and the discontinued zutopia division operations 
in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock 
from this authorized plan   shares split adjusted were repurchased at a cost of million 
these repurchased shares were reflected as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheets  until they were retired on december   as authorized by the board of directors 
on october   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our outstanding class a common stock 
this amount included the remaining shares previously authorized for repurchase by the board of directors 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares for million and retired these shares 
an additional  shares were repurchased for million in the first quarter of fiscal and these shares were also retired 
as of january   there were  shares remaining that are authorized for repurchase 
presently  there are no plans to repurchase additional shares 
we have a revolving line of credit arrangement with bank of america  na under which we may borrow up to a maximum of million on a revolving basis through july  we renegotiated and revised certain of the covenants included in this secured line of credit on january   primarily as a result of the decision to divest the zutopia division 
the amended line of credit arrangement is secured by our merchandise inventory 
at january   there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit arrangement 
there were million in open letters of credit related to imported inventory orders as well as standby letters of credit totaling million 
as of january   we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the credit arrangement 
we were required for the fourth fiscal quarter to meet a net worth covenant of million adjusted for the disposition of the zutopia division  the class action legal settlement  and year end markdowns 
we are also required to maintain a minimum cash and investment balance under the line of credit 
to the extent that our cash and investment balance falls below the million required cash covenant  the line of credit may not be available  and therefore we would have to rely upon our cash and investments to meet our operating requirements 
we invest our excess funds in short term investment grade money market funds  investment grade municipal and commercial paper and us treasury and agency obligations 
assets listed as long term investments on our balance sheet consist of high credit quality municipal and corporate bonds with maturities extending no further than three years out 
we believe that our available cash and investments aggregating million at january  and other working capital and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for the next months 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending the first week of september  historically accounting for a large percentage of sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average slightly less than of our annual sales  after adjusting for sales increases related to new stores 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past three years 
however  we cannot assure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
commitments and contingencies our principal contractual obligations consist of minimum annual rental commitments under non cancelable leases for our stores  our corporate office  warehouse facility  automobiles  computer equipment and copiers 
at january   our contractual obligations under these leases were as follows in thousands contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases management fees payable to related parties operating leases include remaining commitments open for the zutopia division 
negotiations of early lease buyouts are anticipated to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal our principal commercial commitments consist primarily of open letters of credit  related to imported inventory orders  secured by our revolving line of credit arrangement 
at january   our contractual commercial commitments under these letters of credit arrangements were as follows in thousands other commercial commitments in thousands total amounts committed amount of commitment expiration per period less than year years years over years letters of credit we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any single supplier
