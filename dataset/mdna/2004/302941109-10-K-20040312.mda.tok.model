the operations of the applied sciences practice are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
during  we acquired the us business recovery services  or brs  division of pricewaterhousecoopers llp  or pwc  which we believe greatly enhanced our ability to provide consulting services in the largest and most complex us turnarounds  restructurings and bankruptcies 
these professionals now operate as part of our corporate finance restructuring practice 

table of contents in the first quarter of  we experienced the unanticipated departures of about professionals in our former fti policano manzo restructuring practice 
see business risks 
our revenues from continuing operations have grown from million in to million in  at a compounded annual growth rate of about 
all of the acquisitions during closed in the fourth quarter  which means that revenues for include revenues from the acquired businesses for a very limited period from their respective dates of acquisition 
we are continuing to integrate the businesses we acquired during and into our company

through our corporate finance services  we can help financially distressed companies implement their plans by providing interim management teams 
in september  we began expanding our corporate finance restructuring practice into markets in the united kingdom 
our investment banking subsidiary  which is part of our corporate finance restructuring practice  has been registered as a broker dealer with the sec and is a member of nasd regulation  inc  or the nasd 
our investment banking subsidiary focuses on providing investment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services to middle market companies 
our specialized expertise in economic consulting provides our clients with expert analyses in areas such as public policy analysis  advice on anti trust and competition issues that arise in the context of potential mergers and acquisitions  other anti trust issues  including advice on alleged price fixing  cartels and other forms of exclusionary behavior  complex litigation before industry regulatory agencies and general strategic consulting 
these services are provided in the context of existing or potential general commercial litigation  anti trust and intellectual property litigation  regulatory litigation and other state and federal regulatory proceedings 
we provide a broad range of consulting services to companies facing adverse circumstances 
we provide impartial expert advice in highly litigious scenarios 
our clients include those companies in these circumstances  as well as creditors or other stakeholders  such as financial institutions and private equity firms  and the law firms that represent them 
during  our clients included of the top us law firms  corporate clients in the fortune  and of the largest banks in the united states 
we have unique capabilities in several highly specialized areas  including telecommunications  transportation  utilities  oil and gas  chemicals  energy  banking and investment banking  pharmaceuticals  tobacco  retail and information technology 
unlike demand for traditional consulting services  which depends primarily on companies internal budgeting decisions  demand for our services is most often driven by non discretionary engagements for businesses facing critical situations that are often adverse 
during  about of our revenues came from repeat business from existing clients and referrals 
in the case of bankruptcy proceedings  bankruptcy courts often approve the selection of third party advisors  reinforcing the non discretionary nature of our services 

table of contents we believe demand for our services will continue to be strong  driven by a number of current and anticipated trends  including the high debt levels that companies are continuing to use and carry  increasingly complex interplay between competitive and regulatory forces faced by a wide range of businesses that encourages  and in some cases  requires the use of outside financial consultants  and the need for objective  independent expertise for critical  business processes 
we believe that our reputation  national scale and large staff of highly qualified professionals position us well to capitalize on the trends driving the growth in our practices 
in september  we opened our london  england office that offers restructuring services in united kingdom markets 
we believe that our services in this area are somewhat unique  and that we should benefit from unmet demand for these services in those markets 
trends affecting our business escalating public scrutiny and regulatory complexity 
we believe that factors driving our business include the increased awareness of the potential for corporate mismanagement or fraud  the heightened scrutiny that often uncovers alleged frauds and spawns investigations and litigation  the continuing trend in high stakes litigation and the effect of increased regulation 
for example  the sarbanes oxley legislation has added a layer of complex regulatory requirements for public companies 
faced with recent enhanced scrutiny by investors and government agencies of financial reporting and corporate governance  in part as a result of this legislation  companies have begun to hire outside professionals to review and analyze their accounting records  internal controls and financial reporting 
we believe that recent mandates arising from the sarbanes oxley legislation  and the emerging trend toward hiring consulting firms unaffiliated with company auditors  represent a fundamental shift in corporate and governmental policy 
we also anticipate that ever increasing litigation costs will require businesses to focus on better managing risks and the litigation process  particularly in large  complex  multi jurisdiction cases and mass tort claims 
these trends should directly benefit independent financial consulting service providers 
increasing need for independent expertise 
we believe that businesses  their creditors and other institutional stakeholders are increasingly engaging consulting firms to provide objective  independent expertise for highly critical business processes  especially in those areas that are complex  unique and incident driven 
businesses and financial institutions facing adverse circumstances have a need to access world class expertise to assist them in implementing tactical operating plans to solve significant business dilemmas 
this is particularly true in highly complex and sophisticated areas such as restructurings  bankruptcies  economic consulting  forensic accounting and high stakes legal proceedings 
trends in continuing use of corporate debt and debt default rates 
we believe that corporate debt levels and related default levels are important indicators of the potential need for restructuring  turnaround  bankruptcy and related consulting services 
us and international companies have increasingly relied on debt  including bank debt  to finance acquisitions  growth initiatives and working capital requirements  and therefore  we believe that debt levels will remain high 
the size of the public and private debt market  as measured by the amount of aggregate us corporate debt outstanding  has consistently expanded over the past years  regardless of economic cycles 
although debt default rates tend to decline during periods of economic expansion  we believe that economic expansion also facilitates new issuances of speculative grade debt  as investors are generally willing to tolerate higher levels of risk during these periods 
historically  we have observed that many speculative grade bond defaults tend to take place within the first three years after issuance 
as such  we believe that economic expansion periods could result in high volumes of debt defaults  fueling demand for turnaround  restructuring  bankruptcy and related consulting services in the future 
the bond market association estimates that the total amount of us corporate debt securities outstanding increased from approximately billion in to trillion in to trillion as of the third quarter of in  total new issuance volume of corporate bonds increased  to approximately billion  compared to the billion issued during  with most of the issuance gains attributed to the high yield 
table of contents sector 
the bond market association attributes this increase to corporations taking advantage of a favorable market environment of low interest rates and narrowing credit spreads to restructure outstanding debt as well as a renewed rate of mergers and acquisition activity as came to an end 
the new issuance volume of non convertible high yield speculative grade debt below bbb rated increased  to approximately billion in  up from the billion issued during according to fitch ratings  corporate high yield bond defaults declined in although the default rate may fluctuate from time to time and should decrease as the economy improves  an increasing aggregate volume of corporate debt suggests that the aggregate volume of corporate debt under default should remain high  which should impact demand for our restructuring related services 
business strategy we are one of the largest providers of forensic accounting and litigation  corporate finance restructuring and economic consulting services in the united states 
we have a year track record of performance and overall expertise 
we provide high caliber consulting services through our staff of professionals who are able to quickly staff even the largest and most complex assignments 
our goal is to anticipate our clients needs and expand our expertise  professionals and the range of consulting services we offer accordingly 
success in our marketplace depends primarily on having a reputation for providing consistently high quality advice and services  on schedule and on budget 
the following are key elements of our business strategy maintain high utilization rates among our professionals 
we carefully monitor our utilization rates on a weekly  monthly and annual basis

we take a disciplined approach when recruiting additional professionals 
although we maintain enough professionals to staff large  complex assignments  we focus on hiring qualified individuals who meet our selective criteria 
high utilization rates allow us to maintain our profitability and make us less vulnerable to fluctuations in our workload 
retain a critical mass of highly qualified professionals 
our professionals are crucial to delivering our services to clients and generating new business 
through our substantial staff of highly qualified professionals  we can handle a number of large  complex assignments simultaneously

leverage our relationships and expertise 
we work hard to maintain our existing client relationships and develop new ones 
we believe that our existing client relationships and our reputation among other professionals  coupled with our recognized expertise  track record and size  are the most critical elements in a decision to retain us 
we receive a significant amount of repeat business and referrals from our financial institution clients  from our clients in regulated industries  and law firm clients 
we have been successful in recent years in expanding the range of consulting services we provide to our clients 
moreover  as a result of the lexecon  das  ten eyck and brs acquisitions  we have greater capacity to handle simultaneously a number of complex  high profile matters 
we strive to build client relationships on a company wide basis  and to that end we enter into corporate as opposed to personal engagements 
in this way  our goal is to develop client relationships that are not entirely dependent on the expertise of any particular professionals  although it is often difficult to decouple client and professional relationships 
by successfully leveraging our reputation  experience and expanded client base  we believe we should obtain a greater number of engagements from both existing and new clients 
expand the range of our consulting services 
we believe that a number of factors driving demand for our services are non cyclical in nature 
these factors include general economic factors  the effects of regulation and competition on various industries  under performing companies  ineffective business strategies  highly leveraged capital structures  failed acquisitions  corporate fraud and the increasing number of high stakes lawsuits 
we anticipate that during more prosperous economic times  demand for restructuring  bankruptcy and related consulting services will continue  but will slow 
we intend to continue to diversify the range of our services in an effort to minimize cyclicality

while we aggressively seek new business opportunities  we maintain high professional standards and carefully evaluate potential new client relationships and engagements before accepting them 
we also employ a full time sales force of people  who assist with the marketing of our consulting services 
competition our business is highly competitive 
our competitors range from large organizations  such as the national accounting firms and the large management consulting companies that offer a broad range of consulting services  to small firms and independent contractors that provide one specialized service 
competitive factors affecting demand for our services include reputation  size  ability to immediately staff a substantial engagement  performance record  quality of work  range of services provided and existing client relationships 
to a lesser extent  we also compete on price  but the critical nature of our services typically reduces price to a secondary consideration 
since our business depends in a large part on professional relationships  our business has low barriers of entry for professionals  including our professionals  wanting to start their own firms or to change employers 
some national service providers are larger than we are and  on any given engagement  may have a competitive advantage over us with respect to one or more competitive factors 
the smaller local or regional firms  while not offering the range of services we provide  often are able to provide the lowest price on a specific engagement because of their lower overhead costs and proximity to the engagement 
patents  licenses and proprietary information we consider certain of our products and processes  including our trialmax comprehensive trial preparation software  proprietary and confidential 
we believe that our non patented intellectual property  particularly some of our process intellectual property  is important to our forensic accounting and litigation practice 
we rely upon non disclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal controls  including confidentiality and invention disclosure agreements with our employees  to protect our proprietary information 
despite these safeguards  there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information 

table of contents human resources at december   we had  employees  of which were billable professionals 
we also engage independent contractors to supplement our professionals on client engagements as needed 
most of our professionals have many years of experience in their field of practice  and many are well recognized for their expertise and experience 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining contracts or represented by a union

business risks our failure to retain qualified professionals or hire additional qualified professionals  would have a negative effect on our future growth and financial performance as well as client engagements  services and relationships 
our business involves the delivery of professional forensic accounting and litigation  corporate finance restructuring and economic consulting services 
in the consulting business  professional acumen  trust and relationships are critical elements of a company s ability to deliver high quality professional services 
our professionals have highly specialized skills 
they also develop strong bonds with the clients they service 
our continued success depends upon our ability to retain and expand our staff of professionals who have expertise  reputations and client relationships critical to maintaining and developing our business 
we face intense competition in recruiting and retaining highly qualified professionals we must have to continue our service offerings 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing professionals or that in the future we will be able to attract and retain enough qualified professionals to maintain or expand our business 
moreover  competition could increase our costs of retaining or hiring qualified professionals  a trend which could harm our operating margins and results of operations 
if our former professionals go into business in competition with us or join our competitors  our client engagements and relationships could decline  financial performance and growth could be adversely affected  and employee morale could suffer  and we may not have legal recourse 
typically  our professionals have a close relationship with the clients they serve  not only based on their expertise but also on bonds of personal trust and confidence 
although our clients generally contract for services with us as a company  and not with individual professionals  in the event that professionals leave  such clients would not be 
table of contents prohibited from hiring those professionals to perform future engagements 
clients could also decide to transfer active engagements to professionals who leave 
the engagement letters that we typically enter into with clients do not obligate them to continue to use our services 
typically  our engagement letters permit clients to terminate our services at any time 
furthermore  while in some cases  the termination of an ongoing engagement by a client could constitute a breach of the client s contract with us  we could decide that preserving the over all client relationship is more important than seeking damages for the breach  and for that or other reasons that are not currently identifiable  decide not to pursue any legal remedies that might be available to us 
we would make the determination whether to pursue any legal actions against a client on a case by case basis 
as of february   of the persons we categorize as senior managing directors have written employment agreements with the company  which may include non competition and non solicitation arrangements 
where we have written non competition agreements  they generally have been drafted to comply with state reasonableness standards 
however  states generally interpret non competition clauses narrowly 
therefore  a state may hold certain restrictions on competition to be unenforceable 
in the event an employee departs  we will consider any legal remedies we may have against such professional on a case by case basis 
however  we may decide that preserving cooperation and a professional relationship  or other concerns  outweigh the benefits of any possible legal recovery 
therefore  we could determine not to pursue legal action  even if available 
in the first quarter of  we experienced the unanticipated departures of about professionals in our former fti policano manzo restructuring practice 
we have striven to reassure our professionals and clients of our interest in them and our ability to provide services comparable to those provided by the departing professionals 
those departures are likely to have a significant negative impact on our operating income for the negative impact could be long term  but we are not able to quantify a long term impact  if any  at this time 
see item legal proceedings 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our utilization and pricing rates 
we calculate the utilization rate for our professional staff by dividing the number of hours all of our professionals charged our clients during a period by the total available working hours for all of our professionals assuming a hour work week and a week year  excluding holidays 
the hourly rates we charge our clients for our services and the number of hours our professionals are able to charge our clients for our services are affected by the level of expertise and experience of the professionals working on a particular engagement and  to a lesser extent  the pricing and staffing policies of our competitors 
if we fail to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals or maintain or increase the hourly rates we charge our clients for our services  our profitability will suffer 
during the third quarter of  demand for our corporate finance restructuring services began to decline  primarily as a result of a strengthening economy 
our corporate finance restructuring practice represented the largest portion of our business in a decrease in utilization of our professional staff in this or other practices  could have a negative impact on our financial results 
our operating profit margins declined in the fourth quarter of  due to the slow down in our corporate finance restructuring business and due to lower utilization rates generated by our recently acquired business relative to our historical experiences 
many of the billable professionals that resigned during the first quarter of  were among our highest billing professionals 
as a result  we expect that our average hourly billable rate during may decline  which would have a negative impact on revenues 
we rely heavily on our senior management team and practice leaders for the success of our business 
we rely heavily upon our senior management team and practice leaders to manage our forensic accounting and litigation  corporate finance restructuring and economic consulting practices 
given the highly specialized nature of our services and the scale of our operations  these people must have a thorough understanding of our service offerings as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage a large organization 
if one or more members of our senior management team or our practice leaders leave and we cannot replace them with a suitable candidate quickly  we could experience difficulty in managing our business properly  and this could harm our business prospects  client relationships  employee morale and results of operations 

table of contents we face intense competition in our business 
if we fail to compete effectively  we may miss new business opportunities or lose existing clients  and our revenues and profitability may decline 
parties from whom we acquire assets may reenter the marketplace to compete with us in the future 
the market for our consulting services is highly competitive 
our competitors range from large organizations  such as the national accounting firms and the large management consulting companies that offer a broad range of consulting services  to small firms and independent contractors that provide one specialized service 
some of our competitors have significantly more financial resources  larger professional staffs and greater brand recognition than we do 
since our business depends in a large part on professional relationships  our business has low barriers of entry for professionals wanting to start their own firms 
in addition  it is relatively easy for professionals to change employers 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to compete successfully for new business opportunities or retain our existing clients or professional employees 
although  in connection with our acquisitions  we obtain non competition arrangements from the sellers  we cannot assure you that any one or more of them will not compete with us in the future 
certain activities may be carved out of  or otherwise may not be prohibited by those arrangements 
also  in some cases we may agree to restraints on our ability to compete with the sellers of those businesses with respect to certain practice areas 
competition may harm our expected revenue growth and results of operations and cause the actual profitability of the acquired business to differ materially from our expectations and the expectations of the investing public 
a failure to meet these expectations could cause the price of our stock to decline 
in connection with the brs acquisition from pwc  we obtained a three year agreement from pwc not to compete with us  the terms of which are currently in dispute and the subject of litigation 
see item legal proceedings 
any claims involving the quality of our services could harm our overall professional reputation  which could harm our ability to compete for new business opportunities or in hiring qualified professionals 
many of our engagements involve complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment 
therefore  we are subject to the risk of professional liability 
often  our engagements involve matters that  if resolved unfavorably  may result in a severe impact on the client s business  cause the client a substantial monetary loss or prevent the client from pursuing business opportunities 
since our ability to generate new client engagements depends upon our ability to maintain a high degree of client satisfaction as well as our reputation among industry professionals  any claims against us involving the quality of our services may be more damaging than similar claims against businesses in other industries 
we do not generally indemnify our clients  however  in certain cases  such as with clients who are governmental agencies or authorities  we may agree to indemnify them and their affiliates against third party liabilities 
indemnification provisions are negotiated on a contract by contract basis and in some cases may be reciprocal or may be coupled with limitations on the amount and type of damages that can be recovered 
any claim by a client or a third party against us could expose us to professional or other liabilities in excess of our insurance limits 
we maintain a limited amount of liability insurance 
the damages and or expenses resulting from any successful claims against us  for indemnity or otherwise  in excess of our insurance limits would have to be borne directly by us and could seriously harm our profitability and financial resources 
our clients may terminate our engagements with little or no notice  which may cause us to experience unexpected declines in our profitability 
much of our business involves large client engagements that we staff with a substantial number of professionals 
the engagement letters that we typically enter into with clients do not obligate them to continue to use our services 
typically  our engagement letters permit clients to terminate our services at any time 
if our clients unexpectedly cancel engagements with us or curtail the scope of our engagements  we may be unable to replace the lost revenues from those engagements and may also be unable to quickly eliminate costs associated with those engagements 
any decrease in revenues without a corresponding reduction in our costs will likely harm our profitability 

table of contents we may have difficulty integrating our acquisitions  or convincing clients to allow assignment of their contracts to us  which may cause our client engagements to decline  with a consequent detrimental affect on our financial results 
the process of integrating our acquisitions into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial  operational and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the operation  development and expansion of our existing business 
to the extent that we have miscalculated our ability to integrate and properly manage any or all of our acquisitions  we may have difficulty in achieving our operating and strategic objectives 
a substantial amount of our growth has been due to acquisitions 
during  we acquired the brs practice 
during  we completed three significant acquisitions  lexecon  the former dispute advisory business of kpmg llp and ten eyck  all of which occurred in the fourth quarter 
the level of integration of these businesses at this time differs 
companies face significant challenges integrating acquisitions of personnel and assets 
some of the problems we face include differences in corporate cultures and management styles  additional or conflicting government regulation  disparate company polices and practices and client conflict issues 
all of our acquisitions in were structured as asset transactions  therefore  a significant number of client engagements with those practices could not be assigned to us without client consent 
all clients may not affirmatively consent to the assignment 
in addition  in some cases there are no written client contracts memorializing an engagement 
such engagements will only continue at the pleasure of those clients 
in certain cases  such as government contracts and bankruptcy engagements  the consents of clients cannot be solicited until after the acquisition has closed 
there is no assurance that local  state and federal governments will agree to novate their contracts to us 
in addition  in an engagement that involves a bankruptcy case  we must make a filing with the applicable us trustee  at which time such us trustee may find that we are no longer disinterested 
in connection with such bankruptcy cases  we may be required to resign and to refund fees collected in connection with those engagements 
we could be responsible for returning fees even if they were not paid to us  but were paid to the company from whom we acquired the business 
in some cases  we may not have legal recourse to demand that the seller of the business reimburse us 
our corporate finance restructuring practice has an increased risk of fee nonpayment 
many of our clients have engaged us because they are experiencing financial distress 
we recognize that these clients may not have sufficient funds to continue operations or to pay for our services 
we have not received retainers before we began performing services on the client s behalf in connection with a significant amount of our restructuring business 
in the cases that we have received retainers  we cannot assure you that the retainers will adequately cover our fees for the services we perform on behalf of these clients 
we are not always able to obtain retainers from clients in bankruptcy as the bankruptcy court must approve our retainers for those clients 
even if a bankruptcy court approves our retainer or engagement  a bankruptcy court has the discretion to require us to return all  or a portion of  our fees 
therefore  we face the risk of nonpayment  which can result in write offs 
for the three years ended december   we wrote off a total of about million of uncollectible fees in all practices  not including amounts attributable to our applied sciences practice  which we sold in more write offs than we expect in any period would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
if the number of debt defaults  bankruptcies or other factors affecting demand for our corporate finance restructuring services declines  our revenues and profitability could suffer 
our corporate finance restructuring practice provides various restructuring and restructuring related services to companies in financial distress or their creditors or other stakeholders 
a number of factors affect demand for this practice s services 
these include the level of lending activity and over leveraging of companies  over expansion by various businesses  increases in merger and acquisition activity  management problems  and the general decline in the economy in the us during the past several years 

table of contents if demand for our restructuring services decreases  the revenues from our turnaround  restructuring and bankruptcy services could decline  which would lower our overall profitability 
if we fail to find suitable acquisition candidates  or if we are unable to take advantage of opportunistic acquisition situations  our ability to expand may be curtailed 
we may experience an increased level of competition in our efforts to make acquisitions in the future 
as a result  we may be unable to continue to make acquisitions or be forced to pay more for the companies that we are able to acquire 
alternatively  at the time an acquisition opportunity presents itself internal and external pressures including  but not limited to  borrowing capacity under our credit facility or the availability of alternative financing  may cause us to be unable to pursue or complete an acquisition 
our ability to grow our business  particularly through acquisitions  may depend on our ability to raise capital by selling equity or debt securities or obtaining additional debt financing 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain financing when we need it or on terms acceptable to us 
in any case  we may be unable to grow our business or expand our service offerings  as quickly as we have in the past  and our profitability may decline 
we may not manage our growth effectively  and our profitability may suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth in recent years 
this rapid expansion of our business may strain our management team  human resources and information systems 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully manage the integration of any businesses we may acquire or that they will result in the financial  operational and other benefits that we anticipate 
to manage our growth successfully  we may need to add qualified managers and employees and periodically update our operating  financial and other systems  as well as our internal procedures and controls 
we also must effectively motivate  train and manage a larger professional staff 
such expansion may result in significant expenditures 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 
from time to time we operate with a substantial amount of debt  with variable interest rates 
our total long term debt at december   was million 
we have historically incurred debt to acquire additional business units 
we borrowed approximately million to acquire the lexecon practice in november operating with a high amount of leverage could require us to redirect a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt 
this would reduce the funds available for operations  future business opportunities  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes 
it will also limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry 
the terms of our debt also require us to meet specified financial covenants 
if we fail either to meet these financial requirements or our lenders do not waive them  we will be required to pay fees and penalties 
our lenders could also accelerate the maturity of our debt if we fail to meet these covenants  which would force us to seek alternative financing 
if this were to happen  we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain the additional financing we may need or that it would be on terms favorable to us 
our debt accrues interest at a variable rate 
we have historically reduced our exposure to rising interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps 
these hedge arrangements may result in us incurring higher interest expenses than we would have incurred without the hedges in place 
we could also face the same problem if we were to decide to once again enter into new hedge arrangements 
if interest rates increase  we will need to dedicate more of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt 
our revenues  operating income and cash flows are likely to fluctuate 
we have experienced fluctuating revenues  operating income and cash flow in some prior periods and expect that this may occur from time to time in the future 
we may experience future fluctuations in our annual or quarterly revenues and operating income because of the timing of our client assignments  the types of assignments we are working on at different times  hiring trends and decreased productivity because of vacations taken by our professionals 
this means our profitability will likely decline if we experience an unexpected variation in the number or timing of client assignments or during the third quarter when substantial numbers of professionals take vacations  which reduces their utilization rates 
we may also experience future fluctuations in our cash flows because of the timing of the payment of incentive compensation to our professionals  which we generally pay during the first quarter of each year 
also  the timing of any future acquisitions and the cost of integrating them may cause fluctuations in our operating results 

table of contents a significant portion of lexecon s revenues result from relationships with clients and industry professionals maintained by messrs 
fischel  carlton and kalt 
the loss of one or more of these key senior managing directors could decrease our revenues and our profitability 
the success of our acquisition of lexecon will depend upon our retention of messrs 
fischel  carlton and kalt as our senior managing directors 
these key senior managing directors have reputations in the field of economics for highly specialized expertise as well as important relationships with existing clients and industry professionals 
their reputations and relationships are critical to retaining and gaining new client engagements  particularly large  complex matters 
we have written five year employment agreements with messrs 
fischel  carlton and kalt 
the loss of messrs 
fischel  carlton or kalt could harm the success of our acquisition of the lexecon practice 
we have a different system of governance and management from the companies from whom we made our acquisitions  which could cause senior professionals who joined us from the acquired companies to leave us 
lexecon  the das and the brs businesses shared many of the management practices and policies of their parent companies 
we believe our management practices and policies differ from the practices and policies of those companies  including  but not limited to  the manner in which potential conflicts of interest were handled 
in some cases  these different management practices and policies may lead to workplace dissatisfaction on the part of those professionals with our way of conducting business 
the loss of one or more key professionals may harm our business and results of operations 
the benefits that each of the brs and das businesses enjoyed when it was part of pwc and kpmg  respectively  will no longer be available and this could harm the profitability of brs or das 
the brs and das businesses benefited from the name recognition and reputation of pwc and kpmg  respectively  and received referrals from other practices within those respective organizations 
now that they are no longer affiliated with those practices  existing and potential clients and industry professionals may not recognize the new brand under which the professionals of brs and das now provide their services 
in addition  neither pwc nor kpmg will refer clients to the brs or das businesses  respectively  in the ordinary course of their businesses 
conflicts of interest may prevent us from providing services to new and existing clients  which could harm our revenues and results of operations 
we follow internal practices to assess real and potential conflicts of interest among our practices and professionals 
for example  we generally will not represent parties adverse to each other in the same matter 
under bankruptcy rules we generally may not represent both a debtor and its creditors on the same engagement 
accordingly  we may have to resign from engagements because of conflicts with engagements entered into by lexecon  the das business or ten eyck prior to our acquiring them 
in addition  lexecon  the das business or ten eyck may not be free to accept engagements they could have accepted prior to our acquiring them because of conflict issues 
under federal bankruptcy laws  we are required to notify the us trustee of real or potential conflicts 
the us trustee could find that we no longer meet the disinterested standard because of real or potential conflicts  and order us to resign and refund fees that have been paid 
in some cases we could be ordered to refund fees that were not paid to us  but that were paid to the sellers of those practices 
we may not have recourse to recover any or all of any refunded fees from such sellers 
future conflicts of interest may require us to decline or resign from additional client engagements 
new acquisitions may require us to resign from current client engagements because of conflicts issues that are not currently identifiable 
our inability to accept new client engagements  or the requirement that we resign from client engagements  as a result of conflicts of interest may harm our revenue growth and results of operations 
item properties we lease our principal corporate facility in annapolis  maryland  under a lease that expires in february this facility contains about  square feet of space

table of contents item legal proceedings from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to claims  asserted or unasserted  or named as a party to lawsuits or investigations 
litigation  in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with any certainty and in the case of more complex legal proceedings such as intellectual property and securities litigation  the results are difficult to predict at all 
we are not aware of any asserted or unasserted legal proceedings or claims that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of our operations 
on february   we filed suit in superior court  in north bergen  new jersey against a number of former employees and the new corporation they formed 
in our complaint  we assert numerous claims  including that these former employees acted contrary to their obligations and breached their duties of loyalty by wrongfully soliciting numerous of our employees to leave the company and to join them in a competitive venture  wrongly solicited our clients and unlawfully used and disclosed our confidential  proprietary and trade secret information in the new business venture 
we are seeking unspecified money damages and equitable relief relating to the non solicitation and hiring away of our employees and clients 
on december   we filed an action against pwc in the supreme court of the state of new york 
the action arises out of our acquisition of pwc s brs business unit in august our asset purchase agreement with pwc contains non competition covenants that are in effect for three years 
we brought this action to enforce the non competition covenants against pwc 
our complaint seeks damages  and injunctive and other equitable relief 
on february   the court granted and denied in part our motion for preliminary injunction 
pwc has appealed the ruling and has sought a stay of discovery pending the appeal 
we are unable to predict the outcome of any of the above proceedings  however  we do not believe an adverse determination with respect to such litigation would have an adverse effect on our financial condition or the results of our operations
