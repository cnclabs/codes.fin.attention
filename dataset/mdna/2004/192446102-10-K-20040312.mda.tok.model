during  of our revenue came from clients in north america 
in  we will look to expand our presence in northern europe as we are starting to see an increased level of interest for offshore services in that region 
in  our operating margin decreased approximately basis points to from in this was consistent with our targeted operating margin range of to of total revenues 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  an increase of million over the prior year 
on december   we announced building plans for three additional fully owned development centers containing over  square feet of space in pune  chennai and bangalore 
total costs related to this program are expected to be approximately million  which we expect to fund from current operations 
accordingly  we believe our financial condition will remain strong 
in addition  we will continue to consider acquisitions of companies that can improve our capabilities in certain market niches or geographic areas 
critical accounting estimates and risks management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities  including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts  the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenues related to our fixed price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting  under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract s cost to date bears to the total estimated cost 
estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract  and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer based upon market capitalization and other information  including the aging of the receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes 
determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance  if any  involves judgment 
as a global company  we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
in the period of resolution  adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate 
on an on going basis  we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized in the period such determination was made 
our indian subsidiary  cognizant india  is an export oriented company  which  under the indian income tax act of  is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten years with respect to cognizant india s export profits 
substantially all of the earnings of cognizant india are attributable to export profits and are therefore currently entitled to a exemption from indian income tax 
these tax holidays will begin to expire in and  under current law  will be completely phased out by march of prior to  it was management s intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from india to the united states  accordingly  we provided for deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately million on all such undistributed earnings through december  during the first quarter of  we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in india and geographic expansion in europe and asia 
as a component of this strategy  we intend to use and future indian earnings to expand operations outside of the united states instead of repatriating these earnings to the united states 
accordingly  effective january   pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 we no longer accrue incremental us taxes on all foreign earnings recognized in and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 
as of december   the amount of unrepatriated indian earnings upon which no incremental us taxes have been recorded is approximately million 
while we have no plans to do so  if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested  we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than the effective rate in due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future  it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on earnings recognized prior to will require adjustment 
effective april   the government of india passed various tax law changes which affected the way in which our earnings are taxed in india 
the tax exemption for export earnings was restored to from 
the surtax was reduced  decreasing the indian effective rate from to for income that is subject to tax  the corporate level tax on the payment of dividends was restored and the withholding tax on dividends was repealed 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually  or as circumstances warrant 
when determining the fair value of our reporting units  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
as of december   our goodwill balance was approximately million 
long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which was adopted in  we review for impairment long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in general  we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset 
the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset 
if such assets were determined to be impaired  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks 
most of our it development centers  including a substantial majority of our employees are located in india 
as a result  we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations  including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions 
to date  we have not engaged in any hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations 
additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts  potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs  quotas and other barriers
