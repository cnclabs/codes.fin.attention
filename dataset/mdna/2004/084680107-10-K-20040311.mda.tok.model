in recent years  the bank s strategy has been to enhance profitability through controlled balance sheet growth by emphasizing the origination of real estate mortgages  commercial loans and home equity loans  increasing sources of noninterest income and by improving operating efficiencies while managing its capital position and limiting its credit and interest rate risk exposure 
the company has established profitability goals of a return on assets of  a return on equity of and an efficiency ratio of under  which it expects to achieve by earnings growth is always a priority for a public company and good balance of this with community involvement and employee retention is paramount to the company s management

o control credit risk by continuing to employ conservative underwriting standards to minimize the level of new problem assets 
o improve asset quality by exiting the indirect sub prime automobile loan business 
o manage interest rate risk by emphasizing investments in shorter term loans and investment securities  engaging in the sale  securitization and purchase of loans and by managing the company s sources of borrowed funds  such as  its ability to borrow from the fhlb of boston 
o limit equity price risk and reductions to capital with decreases in its equity securities portfolio by selling a portion of its marketable equity securities portfolio 
o operate more efficiently by increasing core deposits through aggressive cross selling of products and using a disciplined approach to deposit pricing  and utilizing six sigma process improvement infrastructure  which is designed to improve the company s operating efficiencies 
o invest primarily in debt instruments that provide adequate liquidity to meet cash flow needs and to earn a reasonable return on investment

the asset liability committee consists of six senior officers of the bank and the senior financial analyst 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of berkshire bank 
in recent years  berkshire bank has managed interest rate risk by o emphasizing the origination and purchase of adjustable rate loans and  from time to time  selling a portion of its longer term fixed rate loans as market interest rate conditions dictate  o securitizing a portion of the bank s long term  fixed rate mortgages  o originating shorter term commercial and consumer loans  o investing in high quality liquid investment securities that provide adequate liquidity and flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from fluctuations in market interest rates  the overall maturity and duration of which is monitored in relation to the repricing of its loan and funding portfolios  o promoting lower cost liability accounts such as core deposits  and o using federal home loan bank advances to better structure maturities of its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
berkshire bank s market risk also includes equity price risk 
berkshire bank s marketable equity securities portfolio had gross unrealized gains of million at december  and no gross unrealized losses which are included  net of taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of berkshire bank s shareholders equity 
if equity securities prices decline due to unfavorable market conditions or other factors  berkshire bank s and berkshire hills capital would decrease 
management decided to decrease the amount of equity securities it holds by selling a portion of its existing portfolio each quarter during quantitative aspects of market risk 
berkshire hills uses a simulation model to measure the potential change in net interest income  incorporating various assumptions regarding the shape of the yield curve  the pricing characteristics of loans  deposits and borrowings  prepayments on loans and securities and changes in the balance sheet mix 
the model assumes the yield curve is derived from the interpolated treasury yield curve and that an instantaneous increase or decrease of market interest rates would cause a simultaneous parallel shift along the entire yield curve 
loans  deposits and borrowings are expected to reprice at the new market rate on the contractual review or maturity date 
the company closely monitors its loan prepayment trends and uses prepayment guidelines set forth by freddie mac and fannie mae and other market sources  as well as company generated data where applicable 
all prepayments are assumed to roll over into new loans originated in the same loan category at the new market rate 
berkshire hills further assumes that its securities cash flows  especially its mortgage backed securities cash flows  are such that they will generally follow industry standards and that prepayments will be reinvested in the same category at the prevailing market rate 
finally  the model assumes that its balance sheet mix will remain relatively unchanged throughout the next calendar year 
the tables below set forth  as of december  and  estimated net interest income and the estimated changes in berkshire hills net interest income for the next twelve month period which may result given instantaneous increases or decreases in market interest rates of and basis points 
increase decrease in at december  market interest rates in basis points rate shock amount change change dollars in thousands static  increase decrease in market at december  interest rates in basis points rate shock amount change change dollars in thousands static  in the event of a sudden and sustained decrease in prevailing market interest rates of and basis points  the december  table indicates that net interest income would be expected to increase  and decrease million  respectively 
this result is due to the fact that the company is slightly liability sensitive and in a basis point decrease many non maturity deposit account rates would decrease significantly and reach company determined floors 
in a negative basis point scenario  many of these deposit accounts would have reached their floors and the company would become asset sensitive 
these results compare to the december  table  which indicates that in the event of a sudden and sustained decrease of and basis points in prevailing market interest rates  net interest income would be expected to decrease by  and million  respectively 
the primary reason for the differences between the models for the two years is that many deposit accounts have lower company determined floors now than they did one year ago 
in the event of a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates of and basis points  the december  table indicates that net interest income would be expected to decrease  and million  respectively  compared to the december  table  which indicates that net interest income would decrease by  and million  respectively 
the primary reason for the difference in the up basis point scenario was that at december   the company had a larger amount of securities  including overnight federal funds  repricing or maturing in the next year than it had on december  partially offsetting this was management s expectation that the rates paid on the company s interest bearing non maturity deposits were less sensitive to changes in prevailing market interest rates at year end than at year end after examining the historic rates paid on interest bearing non maturity deposits compared to the then prevailing market interest rates  management determined during that the rates paid or the cost of these deposits would not have to increase as much in a rising interest rate environment than what was anticipated at year end computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on a number of assumptions including the level of market interest rates  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates  the expected prepayment rates on loans and investments  the degree to which early withdrawals occur on certificates of deposit and other deposit flows 
as a result  these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates
