item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company and its subsidiaries are engaged in the design  manufacture  distribution and sale of women s and children s apparel  and vinyl  leather and fabric handbags  sport bags  backpacks  cosmetic bags  and related products 
our apparel lines include women s loungewear  sleepwear  dresses and sportswear  and lingerie  as well as infants and children s clothing 
our products are mostly made to order  and we market and sell our products to a range of retailers  including  general merchandise stores  retail chain stores  department stores  cosmetic companies  major mail order catalogs and other specialty retailers 
our business is subject to seasonal variations 
historically  we have realized a significant portion of net sales during the first and second fiscal quarters  during which time our customers generally increase inventory levels in anticipation of both back to school and holiday sales 
that trend has continued during fiscal the company believes this seasonality is consistent with the general pattern associated with sales to the retail industry and we expect this pattern to continue 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of other factors  including the timing of shipments to customers and general economic conditions 
accordingly  comparisons between quarters may not necessarily be meaningful  and the results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results or of full year performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of accounting policies  many of which require the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from its estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required by the policies  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  the company has found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies that are described below 
merchandise inventory 
the company s merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and also maintains accounts receivable insurance on certain of its customers 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
market development accruals 
the company estimates reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
finite long lived assets 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of finite lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
in making this assessment  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
a change in these underlying assumptions may cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying value 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge which would impact earnings 
deferred taxes 
should the company determine that it becomes more likely than not that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
liquidity and capital resources the net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended june  of  was the result of funds provided by operating activities totaling  offset by funds used in investing activities of  and by funds used in financing activities totaling  net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net earnings of  a decrease in inventory levels totaling  reflecting higher fourth quarter sales in fiscal compared to the prior comparable period  and an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of  offsetting these positive cash flow factors was an increase in accounts receivable totaling  cash used in investing activities totaling  was for purchases of property and equipment 
funds used in financing activities were  for the most part  related to the repurchase of the company s common stock under the company s stock repurchase program and from the exercise of stock options offset by an increase in bank borrowing

results of operations compared to net sales for fiscal totaled  an increase of  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 
sales by category were as follows net sales for the apparel category in fiscal were  an increase of  or  compared to fiscal the sales increase for this category was primarily due to an  increase in net sales from the women s sleepwear business  which resulted mostly from increased orders from one customer based on prior season sell through of both private label and licensed product 
this significant increase was offset  in part  by an almost  decrease in the catalog business reflecting continued lower demand for mail order apparel 
the remainder of the offset is attributable to lower children s apparel sales reflecting a lower level of reorders from one of our customers 
net sales for the handbags category were  for the year ended june   an increase of  or about  above the same period in the prior year 
the increase was due to a  increase in the premium business reflecting increased orders by one of our significant customers  offset by a  decrease in our handbag business  where licensed products were in less demand 
overall gross margins were in compared to in the prior fiscal year 
gross margins by category were as follows gross margin for the apparel category in improved to from in the prior fiscal year 
the percentage point increase was primarily attributable to higher margins contributed by the children s apparel business due to a favorable product mix  offset by lower margins in the women s sleepwear business attributable to increased cotton and other raw material prices in the far east  as well as an increase in the level of shipments to discounters during this period 
gross margin for the handbags category decreased to in compared to in the similar prior year 
a lower gross margin in the handbag business  for the most part  reflects marketplace competition on several programs causing this division to reduce its gross profit margin to an acceptable level in order to maintain sales 
the overall decrease was not completely offset by slightly higher gross profit margins in the premium business 
shipping  selling and administrative expenses increased by  in fiscal to  of net sales 
the prior fiscal year totaled  of net sales 
the increase was mainly due to volume mix related expenses in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
a significant part of the increase related to higher selling commissions as a result of changes in sales mix an increase of  product development an increase of  higher royalty expense an increase of  relating to additional licensed product sales  an increase related to a charge for a union pension withdrawal liability an increase of  and higher business and employee health care insurance premiums totaling approximately  reference is made to note j  employees benefit plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page f of this form k for additional information about the increase in the reserve for the union pension withdrawal liability 
interest expense was  an increase of  from the last fiscal year  reflecting an increased level of bank borrowing necessary to finance the increased volume of business in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal the slight increase was offset somewhat by an approximately one half percent lower average interest rate in fiscal compared with the prior year 
net earnings of  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to net earnings of  in the prior year 
this year s higher net earnings were primarily due to higher sales and gross margins  not completely offset by higher shipping  selling and administrative expenses  and higher interest expense  as discussed above 
compared to net sales for fiscal totaled  an increase of  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 
sales by category were as follows net sales for the apparel category in fiscal were  or  higher than the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of net sales of topsville in the current year  compared with only six months of sales in the prior year 
in addition  higher levels of shipping to existing and new customers of the women s sleepwear business  mostly during the first half of the company s fiscal year  accounted for the remainder of the increase in this category 
net sales for the handbags category in fiscal were  or about lower than the prior fiscal year s total of  the sales decrease mostly reflected the non renewal of the anne klein license and lower sales for the premium bag business  offset somewhat by higher sales in the children s handbag division 
gross margins were in both fiscal and however  the period ended june  includes a  expense related to the portion of purchase costs allocated to inventory for the acquisition of topsville in january  which had the effect of decreasing last year s gross margins by one half of one percent 
gross margins by category were as follows gross margin for the apparel category in increased to in from in the increase was primarily attributable to better full year margins in the children s apparel business  acquired in january gross margin for the handbags category in decreased to in from in this decrease was mainly due to the non renewal of the anne klein licensing business and lower competitive margins in our premium business  offset to some extent by better children s handbag margins 
shipping  selling and administrative expenses increased by  in fiscal including a prior year  charge related to the topsville acquisition mainly due to volume related expenses in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  as a percentage of net sales  shipping  selling and administrative expenses declined to from in fiscal  due to the relatively lower level of fixed expenses in fiscal compared to higher net sales 
interest expense was  an increase of  from the last fiscal year  primarily the result of interest expense associated with the  mortgage financing consummated in august  and also from a greater level of borrowing needed to finance the increased volume of business in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal net earnings of  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to a net loss of  in the prior year including an after tax charge of  relating to the fair value adjustment in connection with the topsville acquisition 
this year s higher net earnings were primarily due to higher gross margin dollars offset by higher interest costs  a relatively lower percentage of shipping  selling and administrative expenses  as discussed above  and a higher effective tax rate  primarily the result of expired foreign tax credits 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies the scope and timing of liability recognition for conditional asset retirement obligations under sfas no 
 and is effective no later than the end of our fiscal year 
we have determined that this interpretation  and the adoption of sfas no 
 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or cash flows 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
 which codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab no 
 revenue recognition  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the changes noted in sab no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 
 which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies 
fin no 
is applicable immediately for vies created after january  and are effective for reporting periods ending after december   for vies created prior to february  in december  the fasb published a revision to fin fin r to clarify some of the provisions of the interpretation and to defer the effective date of implementation for certain entities 
under the guidance of fin r  public companies that have interests in vie s that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities are required to apply the provisions of fin r for periods ending after december  a public company that does not have any interests in special purpose entities but does have a variable interest in a vie created before february   must apply the provisions of fin by the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  the company adopted fin and fin r during the year ended june  the adoption of fin had no impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the company since the company does not have investments in vie s 
on april   the sfas issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is intended to result in more consistent reporting of contracts as either free standing derivative instruments subject to sfas in its entirety  or as hybrid instruments with debt host contracts and embedded derivative features 
in addition  sfas clarifies the definition of a derivative by providing guidance on the meaning of initial net investments related to derivatives 
there was no impact on the consolidated financial statements from the adoption of sfas in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this standard requires an issuer to classify certain financial instruments as liabilities 
it also changes the classification of certain common financial instruments from either equity or presentation to liabilities and requires an issuer of those financial statements to recognize changes in fair value or redemption amount  as applicable  in earnings 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and with one exception  is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas at this time has had no impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to interest rate change market risk 
since our borrowing patterns are cyclical  the company is not dependent on borrowing throughout the year 
nevertheless  a sudden increase in interest rates which under our bank line of credit is at the prime rate or at libor plus basis points may  especially during peak borrowing  potentially have a significant negative impact on the company s results of operations 
the company estimates that a basis point fluctuation in applicable market interest rates would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately  based on fiscal borrowing levels 
we have not used  and currently do not anticipate using  any derivative financial instruments 
in addition  we have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as substantially all of our business is transacted in  and is expected to continue to be transacted in us dollar based currencies
