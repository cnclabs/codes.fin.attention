item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we manufacture  recycle  market and distribute steel and metal products through a network of over locations in the united states and internationally 
subsequent to our acquisitions of cmc zawiercie cmcz and the lofland company lofland in december  we have revised our segment reporting to include five reportable segments 
we have maintained our recycling and marketing and distribution segments  but presented our new polish minimill  cmcz  separately because its economic characteristics are different from our domestic minimills 
our former manufacturing segment has been split into two segments domestic mills  including our four steel minimills and copper tube minimill  and domestic fabrication  including our new rebar acquisition lofland 
following our acquisition of lofland  we made internal management reporting changes which necessitated this change in segment reporting 
we have revised prior period results to be consistent with our current segment presentation 
domestic mills operations we conduct our domestic mills operations through a network of steel mills  commonly referred to as minimills  that produce reinforcing bar  angles  flats  small beams  rounds  fence post sections and other shapes  scrap processing facilities that directly support these minimills  and a copper tube minimill 
cmcz operations we conduct our cmcz minimill operation through a rolling mill that produces primarily reinforcing bar  a rolling mill that produces primarily wire rod  and our majority owned scrap processing facilities that directly support cmcz 
domestic fabrication operations we conduct our domestic fabrication operations through a network of steel fabrication and processing plants that bend  weld  cut and fabricate steel  primarily reinforcing bar and angles  warehouses that sell or rent products for the installation of concrete  plants that produce special sections for floors and ceiling support  plants that produce steel fence posts  plants that treat steel with heat to strengthen and provide flexibility  a plant that rebuilds railcars  and a railroad salvage company 
recycling operations we conduct our recycling operations through metal processing plants located in the states of florida  georgia  kansas  louisiana  missouri  north carolina  oklahoma  south carolina  tennessee  and texas 
marketing and distribution operations we market and distribute steel  copper and aluminum coil  sheet and tubing  ores  metal concentrates  industrial minerals  ferroalloys and chemicals through our network of marketing and distribution offices  processing facilities and joint ventures around the world 
our customers use these products in a variety of industries 
you should read this management s discussion and analysis in connection with your review of our consolidated audited financial statements and the accompanying footnotes 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the following are important accounting policies  estimates and assumptions that you should understand as you review our financial statements 
we apply these accounting policies and make these estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our use of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions affects our results of operations and our reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
where we have used estimates or assumptions  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when title passes to the customer either when goods are shipped or when they are received based on the terms of the sale 
for a few of our steel fabrication operations  we recognize net sales and profits from certain long term fixed price contracts by the percentage of completion method 
for the years ended august   and  respectively  we recognized approximately  and of our total net sales on a percentage of completion basis 
in determining the amount of net sales to recognize  we estimate the total costs and profits expected to be recorded for the contract term and the recoverability of costs related to change orders 
when we estimate that a contract will result in a loss  the entire loss is accrued as soon as it is probable and estimable 
through the passage of time  due to the variances between actual costs and those that we previously anticipated  our estimates could change  resulting in changes in our earnings 
contingencies we make accruals as needed for litigation  administrative proceedings  government investigations including environmental matters  and contract disputes 
we base our environmental liabilities on estimates regarding the number of sites for which we will be responsible  the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site  the portion of costs that we expect we will share with other parties and the timing of the remediation 
where timing of expenditures can be reliably estimated  we discount amounts to reflect our cost of capital over time 
we record these and other contingent liabilities when they are probable and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
where timing and amounts cannot be precisely estimated  we estimate a range  and we recognize the low end of the range without discounting 
also  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
inventory cost we determine inventory cost for most domestic inventories by the last in  first out method  or lifo 
at the end of each quarter  we estimate both inventory quantities and costs that we expect at the end of the fiscal year for these lifo calculations  and we record an amount on a pro rata basis 
these estimates could vary substantially from the actual year end results  causing an adjustment to cost of goods sold in our fourth quarter 
see note  quarterly financial data  to the consolidated financial statements 
we record all inventories at the lower of their cost or market value 
property  plant and equipment our domestic mills  cmcz and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
we evaluate the value of these assets and other long lived assets whenever a change in circumstances indicates that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
some of the estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations utilize judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce 
if these assets were for sale  our estimates of their values could be significantly different because of market conditions  specific transaction terms and a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
also  we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on our estimate of the assets economically useful lives 
to the extent that an asset s actual life differs from our estimate  there could be an impact on depreciation expense or a gain loss on the disposal of the asset in a later period 
we expense major maintenance costs as incurred

table of contents consolidated results of operations year ended august  in millions except share data net sales net earnings per diluted share ebitda international net sales as of total lifo effect on net earnings expense income per diluted share last in  first out inventory valuation method 
in the table above  we have included a financial statement measure that was not derived in accordance with gaap 
we use ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization as a non gaap performance measure 
in calculating ebitda  we exclude our largest recurring non cash charge  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal  state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions 
tax regulations in international operations add additional complexity 
also  we exclude interest cost in our calculation of ebitda 
the results are  therefore  without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed 
we use ebitda as one guideline to assess our unleveraged performance return on our investments 
ebitda is also the target benchmark for our long term cash incentive performance plan for management 
reconciliations to net earnings are provided below for the year ended august in millions net earnings interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenues 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
also  the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our operations 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is appropriate to consider both net earnings determined under gaap  as well as ebitda  to evaluate our performance 
also  we separately analyze any significant fluctuations in interest expense  depreciation and amortization and income taxes 
our ebitda increased to million for our fiscal year ended august  as compared to million in the following events had a significant financial impact during our fiscal year ended august  as compared to our fiscal year we reported our highest net sales and net earnings ever 
increased selling prices  margins  production  and shipments resulted in significantly higher adjusted operating profits in our domestic mills and recycling segments 
in december  we acquired a minimill in poland and a rebar fabricator with operations in texas and surrounding states which significantly expanded our international manufacturing capabilities and enhanced our domestic market share in rebar fabrication 
margins in our domestic fabrication segment were compressed because of the rapid increase in input costs  but adjusted operating profits were better than last year 

table of contents we attained record adjusted operating profits in our marketing and distribution segment due to robust demand in asia especially china  the improved us economy  the weak us dollar  and lower end user inventories 
we recorded a million after tax lifo expense per diluted share compared to million lifo expense per diluted share in in  we issued million aggregate principal amount of notes due following the purchase of million of our notes otherwise due in our overall effective tax rate was lower due primarily to a effective tax rate in poland 
in  our net earnings reached all time record levels as a result of the combination of historically high selling prices  margins  production and shipments in most of our segments 
these positive factors more than offset increased purchase prices  lifo expenses and other input costs 
we also benefited from growth and acquisitions  especially our acquisition of of cmcz in poland 
global market conditions were favorable which resulted in significantly increased selling prices and metal spreads  especially for our steel scrap and steel mill products 
these market conditions included strong demand in asia  an improving us economy  the relatively weak us dollar and low end user inventories 
demand for our products was robust  and supply was tight 
our strategy of diversifying our business by segment  products and geography allowed us to take advantage of the positive environment 
conditions improved significantly throughout fiscal  and our net earnings in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal exceeded those for any previous complete fiscal year 
segments unless otherwise indicated  all dollars below are before minority interests and income taxes 
financial results for our reportable segments are consistent with the basis and manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information for making operating decisions 
following our acquisitions in december  we have revised our segment reporting to include five reportable segments 
we have revised prior period results to be consistent with our current segment presentation 
see note  business segments  to the consolidated financial statements 
we use adjusted operating profit loss to compare and evaluate the financial performance of our segments 
adjusted operating profit is the sum of our earnings before income taxes  minority interests and financing costs 
adjusted operating profit is equal to earnings before income taxes for our domestic mills and domestic fabrication segments because these segments require minimal outside financing 
the following table shows net sales and adjusted operating profit loss by business segment year ended august  in millions net sales domestic mills cmcz domestic fabrication recycling marketing and distribution corporate and eliminations adjusted operating profit loss domestic mills cmcz domestic fabrication recycling marketing and distribution corporate and eliminations acquired december dollars are before minority interests 

table of contents compared to domestic mills we include our four domestic steel and our copper tube minimills in our domestic mills segment 
in  our domestic mills segment set all time annual records for production  shipments and adjusted operating profits 
our domestic mills segments adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  increased by million as compared to on million more net sales 
net sales and adjusted operating profit were higher in due primarily to higher selling prices and shipments as compared to metal margins the difference between the average selling price and scrap purchase cost for the segment increased significantly in as compared to because increases in selling prices more than offset the increases in scrap purchase and other input costs and much higher expenses related to valuing our inventories under the lifo method 
our lifo expenses increased due to our higher scrap purchase and other input costs  as well as increased inventory quantities 
adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills was million for the year ended august  as compared to million for selling prices and shipments increased in as compared to due to stronger demand  which was partially due to the recovering us economy 
also  the competition from foreign steel imports was less as a result of the weaker us dollar and stronger global markets  especially in china 
average scrap purchase costs were higher than last year due primarily to increased world demand for ferrous scrap 
our overall metal margins increased  resulting in significantly higher total adjusted operating profits for the four steel minimills in as compared to the table below reflects domestic steel and ferrous scrap prices per ton for the year ended august increase average mill selling price finished goods average mill selling price total sales average ferrous scrap purchase price average metal margin the domestic steel minimills production and shipment levels tons melted  rolled and shipped for the year ended august  were at all time record levels  in spite of the transformer failure at smi texas on may  the table below reflects our domestic steel minimills operating statistics for the year ended august in thousands increase tons melted tons rolled tons shipped due to the factors discussed above  all of our domestic steel minimills  except for smi texas  were more profitable for the year ended august  as compared to smi alabama reported an adjusted operating profit of million  an increase of million for the year ended august  as compared to smi south carolina reported million in adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  as compared to a million adjusted operating loss in adjusted operating profit at smi arkansas increased by million to an adjusted operating profit of million for the year ended august  however  adjusted operating profit at smi texas decreased by million to million for the year ended august  as compared to this decrease was due largely to the failure of smi texas primary transformer on may   with the subsequent failure of the principal back up transformer in june and accruals related to a sales tax audit and unclaimed property 
although another replacement transformer was installed  it had a lower capacity  resulting in lower production than we had planned 
in order to meet our sales commitments to our smi texas customers in the fourth quarter of  we purchased and rolled billets from other affiliated and unrelated minimills at higher costs 
we intend to file a claim with our business interruption insurance carrier 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
overall  the steel minimills recorded million lifo expense in as compared to million in utility expenses increased by million in as compared to electricity increased by million due to both higher usage from increased overall production and rate increases 
natural gas costs increased 
table of contents by million due to higher rates and usage 
costs for ferroalloys and graphite electrodes increased by million and million  respectively  in as compared to largely to more demand from us mills  the impact of the weaker us dollar and higher ocean freight costs on these imported items 
our copper tube minimill s adjusted operating profit was million during the year ended august  as compared to an adjusted operating profit of thousand for copper tube selling prices and shipments increased due to stronger demand from residential and commercial customers 
the strong us market in more than compensated for increased foreign imports  alternative competing products such as plastic water tubing  and consolidation among our customers 
our average selling price increased more than our average copper scrap purchase cost resulting in increased metal margins in as compared to the table below reflects our copper tube minimill s prices and costs per pound and operating statistics for the year ended august pounds in millions increase pounds shipped pounds produced average selling price average scrap purchase cost average metal margin our copper tube minimill recorded million lifo expense for the year ended august  as compared to thousand in cmcz on december   our swiss subsidiary acquired of the outstanding shares of huta zawiercie  sa cmcz  a steel minimill in zawiercie  poland 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
this acquisition greatly expanded our international manufacturing operations 
cmcz recorded net sales of million and an adjusted operating profit of million before minority interests for the year ended august  the factors described above affecting our domestic steel minimills affected cmcz as well  except that it did not benefit from the weaker us dollar 
however  although market conditions remained favorable  the average selling price decreased by during the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of due to increased competition 
subsequent to our acquisition  cmcz  in coordination with our international marketing and distribution operation  found new outlets for its products 
the table below reflects cmcz s steel and ferrous scrap prices per ton and our key operating statistics tons in thousands for the nine months ended august  average mill selling price total sales tons melted  average ferrous scrap purchase price tons rolled average metal margin tons shipped  domestic fabrication our domestic fabrication businesses reported an adjusted operating profit of million for the year ended august  as compared to an adjusted operating profit of thousand in net sales were billion in  an increase of million as compared to on december   we acquired of the stock of lofland acquisition  inc lofland which operates steel reinforcing bar fabrication and construction related product sales facilities from locations in texas  arkansas  louisiana  oklahoma  new mexico and mississippi 
this acquisition complemented our existing texas rebar fabrication and construction related products sales operations and expanded our service areas in each of the neighboring states 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
lofland accounted for million of the increase in net sales and reported a million adjusted operating loss during subsequent to our acquisition 
lofland recorded a loss primarily because the overall purchase costs from our steel suppliers increased against our selling prices 
lofland s sales prices did not increase as fast as our steel purchase costs because much of our fabrication work was sold months in advance at a fixed price 
however  our domestic fabrication segment s overall adjusted operating profit increased in as compared to due to overall higher average selling prices and shipments 
as progressed  market conditions became increasingly favorable  resulting in higher gross margins in all of our product lines including rebar fabrication  construction related products  steel fence posts  steel joists  castellated beams and structural steel fabrication 
increases in steel purchase costs were more than offset by increased selling prices and shipments 
although construction activity was mixed and varied by region  some private nonresidential construction markets improved and public and institutional construction continued at a solid level enabling us to obtain higher selling prices and increase shipments to meet demand 

table of contents our acquisition of lofland resulted in thousand additional tons shipped 
the table below shows the average fabrication selling prices per ton excluding stock and buyout sales and total fabrication plant shipments for the years ended august increase average fabrication selling price tons shipped in thousands we recorded million of lifo expense in our domestic fabrication segment for the year ended august   due to the higher cost of steel and more inventories on hand 
during the year ended august   we recorded million of lifo expense 
during the year ended august   we recorded impairment charges of million 
see note  asset impairment charges  to the consolidated financial statements 
we are continuing to evaluate certain other facilities which are performing under expectations or for which we are considering alternative uses 
our current estimates of cash flows do not indicate that the assets are impaired 
however  these estimates and expected uses could change resulting in additional asset impairments 
during  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of the denver  colorado location of symons corporation  el wills in fresno  california and dunn del re steel in chandler  arizona for a total of million 
no single one of these acquisitions was significant to our operations  nor were they significant in the aggregate 
recycling our recycling segment reported an adjusted operating profit of million for the year ended august  as compared with an adjusted operating profit of million in net sales for the year ended august  were higher at million 
gross margins in were much higher as compared to our selling prices  particularly ferrous scrap  increased significantly because demand from far eastern buyers  especially china  and the weaker us dollar resulted in more scrap exports by our competitors 
in addition  domestic demand for ferrous scrap increased due to high levels of steel production  resulting in higher shipments 
we exported nonferrous scrap to both asia and europe during our sales volumes increased as well  partially due to additional materials that we were able to obtain through our national accounts program directed at the management of scrap for our manufacturing customers 
the following table reflects our recycling segment s average selling prices per ton and tons shipped in thousands for the year ended august increase average ferrous selling price average nonferrous selling price ferrous tons shipped nonferrous tons shipped total volume processed and shipped includes all of our domestic processing plants 
also  we recorded million lifo expense for the year ended august  as compared to million in  due primarily to increased material purchase costs 
marketing and distribution net sales in our marketing and distribution segment increased million for the year ended august  as compared to  million of which resulted from functional currency fluctuations 
our adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  was million as compared to million in  an increase of 
our increased profitability in marketing and distribution was largely the result of our strategy in recent years to build up our regional business around the world and to increase our downstream presence 
the net effect of functional currency fluctuations on our adjusted operating profit was an increase of million 
the remainder of the increases in net sales and adjusted operating profit was due to higher shipments and selling prices in as compared to for all divisions 
the effect of these increases was partially offset by million lifo expense in lifo expense of thousand was recorded in our higher lifo expense was due to increases in both inventory purchase costs and quantities 
markets were favorable in several geographic regions around the world 
our sales increased significantly in the united states and europe 
we imported more steel  aluminum  copper and stainless steel into the united states  and gross 
table of contents margins for these products were higher in as compared to also  sales increased for most of our product lines 
sales to and within asia were up significantly  and the economy in australia was still strong 
our sales and adjusted operating profits for industrial materials and products were at record levels because of strong demand  especially in china  europe and the us during  we received a dividend of czk million million from our investee  trinecke zelezarny  a czech steel mill 
corporate and eliminations commensurate with our overall increase in profitability  discretionary items such as bonuses  profit sharing and contributions increased for the year ended august  as compared to our interest expense for the year ended august  increased as compared to due primarily to our issuance of million additional long term debt which we used to finance the acquisitions of cmcz and lofland 
see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
also  our average short term borrowings increased in as compared to to finance additional working capital including our operations in poland 
our overall effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended august  as compared to in  due to the effective tax rate in poland of 
we consider our investment in cmcz to be permanent 
near term outlook we expect that the positive market conditions that resulted in our record net sales and adjusted operating profits will continue in our fiscal year ending august  overall  our selling prices and volumes should be sustainable 
we believe that activity in china has slowed as the chinese government moderates the growth rate  however  increased exports from china to other asian countries should benefit our international division 
we believe that the moderate slowing of china s economy thereby avoiding a hard landing  the continued us economic recovery and improved state budgets in the us will all positively impact our business 
however  our adjusted operating profits could be reduced if very high petroleum prices cause further increases in utility and freight costs 
we expect that while our overall level of profitability will be sustained in as compared to  a higher proportion of our adjusted operating profits will be from our domestic fabrication segment because our backlog has higher selling prices 
cmcz s adjusted operating profit will be lower partially due to increased competition in their marketplace 
our domestic mills and marketing and distribution segments should continue to report comparable levels of adjusted operating profits in as compared to  while recycling s adjusted operating profit should be lower as ferrous prices moderate 
orders and selling prices in our domestic mills and marketing and distribution segments should remain firm 
our lifo expenses should be lower in fiscal as compared to we anticipate that our effective tax rate for the first quarter of will be  excluding any impact from recent legislation 
on october   the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act which offers a limited window of opportunity to repatriate certain cash dividends from foreign subsidiaries at a reduced rate 
the company is currently evaluating the act 
due to the uncertainties regarding the new legislation  the company has not had sufficient time to evaluate all available alternatives 
we anticipate reaching final conclusions regarding the implications of the act in fiscal we estimate that our net earnings per diluted share including the impact of adjusting our inventory valuation to the lifo method will be between and for the three months ending november  we have successfully reinstalled our principal transformer at smi texas 
we maintain business interruption insurance which should cover a substantial portion of the reduction in profitability at smi texas as a result of the production curtailment during the fourth quarter of we also expect to file an additional business interruption claim covering a failure during start up in august of a new  higher capacity transformer at smi south carolina 
we have returned this transformer to its manufacturer in italy  and it is now scheduled to be reinstalled in november we have not considered any business interruption insurance recoveries  which may be substantial  in our earnings estimate for the three months ended november  because we are unable to estimate the minimum recoverable amount 
also  we are uncertain as to the timing of recoveries 
we anticipate that our capital spending for will be million  including acquisition costs for a shredder at cmcz and a continuous caster project at our smi texas melt shop 

table of contents long term outlook the rapid expansion of a number of emerging economies  including china  has been a major catalyst for the strong steel and nonferrous markets around the world 
the magnitude of the growth in these economies has been a new dynamic in the global marketplace 
therefore  we believe that there is an enhanced prospect of significant long term growth in demand for the global materials sector 
we believe that we are well positioned to exploit long term opportunities 
we expect strong demand for our products due to continuing recovery in demand throughout the major global economies as well as continued growth in developing countries 
emerging countries often have a higher growth rate for steel and nonferrous metals consumption 
we believe that the demand will increase in asia  particularly in china  as well as in central and eastern europe 
we believe that there will be further consolidation in our industries  and we plan to continue to participate in a prudent way 
the reasons for further consolidation include a historically inadequate return on capital for many companies  a high degree of fragmentation  the need to eliminate non competitive capacity and more effective marketing 
compared to domestic mills our domestic mills adjusted operating profit decreased million as compared to a litigation settlement at the steel mills in accounted for million of the decrease 
excluding this item  adjusted operating profit decreased in as compared to the effect of valuing inventories under the lifo method and increased utility costs accounted for million and million  respectively  of the decrease in adjusted operating profit 
the remaining million was due to higher scrap purchase costs  net of the effect of higher selling prices and shipments 
net sales for the year ended august  increased million as compared to our steel minimills implemented higher selling prices that became partially effective during the second half of  although steel mill selling prices were at very low levels for much of however  scrap purchase prices were driven sharply higher by offshore demand and the weakening value of the us dollar 
the selling price increases and increased shipments did not fully offset higher scrap and utility costs 
gross margins were significantly lower as a result of these conditions 
our copper tube mill s gross margins were also lower due to increased copper scrap purchase prices and lower selling prices for its products 
adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills decreased million for the year ended august  as compared to the effect of valuing inventories under the lifo method accounted for million of the decrease in adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  as compared to also  during the year ended august   our domestic steel minimills received million from a nonrecurring graphite electrode litigation settlement 
even excluding these items  adjusted operating profit in decreased as compared to because higher shipments and average selling prices were not enough to offset higher input costs  including scrap and utilities 
the table below reflects domestic steel and scrap prices per ton for the year ended august average mill selling price finished goods average mill selling price total sales average ferrous scrap purchase price the domestic mills production and shipment levels tons melted  rolled and shipped were as follows for the year ended august increase in thousands decrease tons melted tons rolled tons shipped our adjusted operating profit at smi texas decreased to million for the year ended august  as compared to an adjusted operating profit of million in smi south carolina lost million for the year ended august  as compared to a million adjusted operating profit in 
table of contents higher scrap costs  higher energy costs and a weak demand for our products were the most significant reasons for smi south carolina s loss in smi arkansas reported a thousand adjusted operating profit in as compared to a million adjusted operating profit in most of the decrease in adjusted operating profit at smi arkansas was attributable to lifo expense caused by higher year end inventories of rerolling rail 
however  adjusted operating profit at our smi alabama mill for the year ended august  increased to million as compared to million in cost reduction efforts  improved operating efficiencies and better market conditions were the key factors in smi alabama s improved profitability 
utility expenses increased by million for the year ended august  as compared to the increase in utility costs was mostly due to higher natural gas costs  although electricity expenses also increased 
our copper tube minimill reported an adjusted operating profit of thousand for the year ended august  as compared to an adjusted operating profit of million in net sales were lower in as compared to the difference between the sales price and copper scrap purchase cost is commonly referred to as the metal margin 
the metal margin declined in as compared to because selling prices decreased while copper scrap purchase costs increased 
although single family residential construction held up relatively well  other market sectors were weaker which put pressure on selling prices 
the table below reflects our copper tube minimill s prices and costs per pound and operating statistics for the year ended august increase pounds in millions decrease pounds shipped pounds produced average selling price average scrap purchase cost average metal margin domestic fabrication our domestic fabrication operations were significantly less profitable in as compared to  primarily due to lower selling prices which more than offset the impact of higher shipments 
our domestic fabrication operations reported an adjusted operating profit of thousand for the year ended august  as compared to a profit of million in we recorded a million gain from the sale of smi owen in march also  prior to its sale  smi owen had an adjusted operating profit of million for the year ended august  excluding these items  domestic fabrication s adjusted operating profits decreased by million for the year ended august  as compared to the million decrease was due primarily to lower selling prices 
the table below shows the average fabrication selling prices per ton excluding stock and buyout sales and total fabrication plant shipments for the year ended august increase decrease average fabrication selling price tons shipped in thousands during  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of the denver  colorado location of symons corporation  el wills in fresno  california  and dunn del re steel in chandler  arizona 
the symons location is a concrete formwork supplier  and el wills and dunn del re steel are rebar fabrication operations 
the purchase prices for these businesses totaled million 
no single one of these acquisitions was significant to our operations 
recycling our recycling segment reported an adjusted operating profit of million for the year ended august  as compared to an adjusted operating profit of million in all four of the geographic regions where the segment operates were substantially more profitable 
net sales for the year ended august  were million  an increase of as compared to our net sales of million in our gross margins were higher in as compared to  partially due to controls over costs 
higher ferrous selling prices resulting from greater demand from overseas markets contributed 
table of contents to this increase  as well as the weaker us dollar 
the following table reflects our recycling segment s average selling prices per ton and tons shipped in thousands for the year ended august increase decrease average ferrous selling price average nonferrous selling price ferrous tons shipped nonferrous tons shipped total volume processed and shipped includes all of our domestic processing plants 
marketing and distribution net sales for the year ended august  for our marketing and distribution segment increased million to billion 
adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  was million  an increase of as compared to most of the increases in net sales and adjusted operating profit related to sales outside of the united states 
international steel prices for flat rolled products rose and then weakened  because of decreased demand from china  during the first three quarters of however  the prices for flat rolled steel products rose again during the fourth quarter 
prices for long products slowly increased during our steel shipments increased  except for imports into the us our business in the us was reduced because of the weak economy and the weaker us dollar 
due to these factors  volumes  prices and margins for nonferrous semi finished products were lower in as compared to however  sales and margins for ores  minerals  ferroalloys and special metals were generally higher 
also  freight costs increased in as compared to our marketing and distribution and service center operations in australia were more profitable in as compared to our joint venture europickling facility in belgium became profitable during also  the joint venture arrangements with our investee  trinecke zelezarny  contributed to our sales in central europe 
sales into asia  including china  were strong  especially during the first and second quarters of our fiscal in july  our international subsidiary entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a controlling interest in cmcz 
this acquisition closed on december  corporate and eliminations our employees retirement plan expenses were lower for the year ended august  as compared to discretionary items  including bonuses and contributions  were lower for the year ended august  as compared to because was less profitable 
interest expense for the year ended august  was lower as compared to due primarily to lower overall interest rates on short term borrowings and two interest rate swaps on parts of our long term debt which resulted in lower effective interest rates 
during  we favorably resolved all issues for our federal income tax returns through due to the lack of any material adjustments  we reevaluated our tax accruals and  consequently  reduced the net tax expense by million during liquidity and capital resources we discuss liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis 
our discussion includes the sources and uses of our five operating segments and centralized corporate functions 
we have a centralized treasury function and use inter company loans to efficiently manage the short term cash needs of our operating divisions 
we invest any excess funds centrally 
we rely upon cash flows from operating activities  and to the extent necessary  external short term financing sources for liquidity 
our short term financing sources include the issuance of commercial paper  sales of accounts receivable  documentary letters of credit with extended terms  short term trade financing arrangements and borrowing under our bank credit facilities 
from time to time  we have issued long term public and private debt 
see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
our investment grade credit ratings and general business conditions affect our access to external financing on a cost effective basis 
depending on the price of our common stock  we may realize significant cash flows from the exercise of stock options 

table of contents moody s investors service p and standard poor s corporation a rate our million commercial paper program in the second highest category 
to support our commercial paper program  we have an unsecured contractually committed revolving credit agreement with a group of sixteen banks 
our million facility expires in august under the program  our commercial paper capacity is reduced by our outstanding standby letters of credit which totaled million at august  the costs of our revolving credit agreement may be impacted by a change in our credit ratings 
we plan to continue our commercial paper program and the revolving credit agreements in comparable amounts to support the commercial paper program 
also  we have numerous informal  uncommitted  short term credit facilities available from domestic and international banks 
these credit facilities are available to support import letters of credit  foreign exchange transactions and  in certain instances  short term working capital loans 
our long term public debt was million at august  and is investment grade rated by standard poor s corporation bbb and by moody s investors services baa 
we believe we have access to the public markets for potential refinancing or the issuance of additional long term debt 
during the year ended august   we purchased million of our notes otherwise due in  and issued million of notes due november in march  we refinanced the notes payable that we assumed upon the acquisition of cmcz with a five year term note with a group of four banks for million pln million and a revolving credit facility with maximum borrowings of million pln million 
the term note and the revolving credit facilities are secured by the majority of cmcz assets and contain certain financial covenants 
there are no guarantees by the company or any of its subsidiaries for any of cmcz s debt 
at august   only a minimal amount was outstanding on cmcz s revolving credit facility 
in order to facilitate certain trade transactions  we utilize letters of credit  advances and non or limited recourse trade financing arrangements to provide assurance of payments and advance funding to our suppliers 
the letters of credit may be for prompt payment or for payment at a future date  conditional upon the bank finding the documentation presented to be in strict compliance with all terms and conditions of the letter of credit 
our banks issue these letters of credit under informal  uncommitted lines of credit which are in addition to the committed revolving credit agreement 
in some cases  if our suppliers choose to discount the future dated obligation we may absorb the discount cost 
the trade financing arrangements consist of a financing agreement with a lender which is secured by a supply agreement with our supplier 
the lender is repaid after the product is delivered to us in conformance with the supply agreement 
we are not liable for repayment of the principal and or interest to the bank unless and until we have received the conforming deliveries from the supplier 
credit ratings affect our ability to obtain short and long term financing and the cost of such financing 
if the rating agencies were to reduce our credit ratings  we would pay higher financing costs and probably would have less availability of the informal  uncommitted facilities 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors 
these factors include earnings  fixed charges such as interest  cash flows  total debt outstanding  off balance sheet obligations and other commitments  total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors 
the rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows  business strategy  industry condition and contingencies 
maintaining our investment grade ratings is a high priority for us 
certain of our financing agreements include various covenants 
our revolving credit agreement contains financial covenants which require that we a not permit our ratio of consolidated long term debt including current maturities to total capitalization defined in our credit agreement as stockholders equity less intangible assets plus long term debt to be greater than to at any time and  b not permit our quarterly ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense on a rolling twelve month basis to 
table of contents be less than to 
at august   our ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization was to 
our ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense for the year ended august  was to 
in addition  our credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  sell assets  in the case of some of our subsidiaries  guarantee debt  and consolidate or merge 
the indenture governing our long term public debt contains restrictions on our ability to create liens  sell assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  consolidate or merge and limits the ability of some of our subsidiaries to incur certain types of debt or to guarantee debt 
also  our five year term note at cmcz contains certain covenants including minimum debt to ebitda  debt to equity and tangible net worth requirements as defined for cmcz only 
we have complied with the requirements  including the covenants of our financing agreements as of and for the year ended august  off balance sheet arrangements for added flexibility  we may secure financing through sales of certain accounts receivable both in the us and internationally 
see note  sales of accounts receivable  to the consolidated financial statements 
our domestic program provides for such sales in an amount not to exceed million  and our european and australian subsidiaries can sell up to million gbp and million aud of additional accounts receivable 
we may continually sell accounts receivable on an ongoing basis to replace those receivables that have been collected from our customers 
the us securitization program contains certain cross default provisions whereby a termination event could occur should we default under another credit arrangement 
as a result of an amendment on april   a different termination event based on our credit ratings that had been included in the program was eliminated 
we use the securitization program as a source of funding that is not reliant on either our short term commercial paper program or our revolving credit facility 
as such  we do not believe that any reductions in the capacity or termination of the securitization program would materially impact our financial position  cash flows or liquidity because we have access to other sources of external funding 
our domestic mills  cmcz and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
our capital requirements include construction  purchases of equipment and maintenance capital at existing facilities 
we plan to invest in new operations  use working capital to support the growth of our businesses  and pay dividends to our stockholders 
we continue to assess alternative means of raising capital  including potential dispositions of under performing or non strategic assets 
any future major acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources such as the issuance of common or preferred stock 
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities primarily result from sales of steel and related products  and to a lesser extent  sales of nonferrous metal products 
we also sell and rent construction related products and accessories 
we have a diverse and generally stable customer base 
we use futures or forward contracts as needed to mitigate the risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and metals commodity prices 
see note  financial instruments  market and credit risk  to the consolidated financial statements 
the volume and pricing of orders from our us customers in the manufacturing and construction sectors affect our cash flows from operating activities 
the pace of economic expansion and retraction of major industrialized and emerging markets especially china outside of the us also significantly affect our cash flows from operating activities 
the weather can influence the volume of products we ship in any given period 
also  the general economy  the strength of the us dollar  governmental action  and various other factors beyond our control influence our volume and prices 
periodic fluctuations in our prices and volumes can result in variations in cash flows from operating activities 
despite these fluctuations  we have historically relied on operating activities as a steady source of cash 

table of contents our operating activities for the year ended august  provided net cash flows of million as compared to the million of net cash flows provided by our operating activities for the year ended august  net earnings were million higher for the year ended august  as compared to however  net working capital increased by million to million at august  from million at august  our newly acquired cmcz and lofland operations accounted for million of the increase of which million was directly related to balances at their acquisitions 
accounts receivable excluding amounts acquired at cmcz and lofland increased million during the year ended august  as compared to this increase was much greater than the increase in accounts receivable of million in  although the trend was generally higher over the past three years due primarily to growth in our operations 
in addition to growth  accounts receivable significantly increased in all segments in  primarily due to higher selling prices and shipments with the majority of the increases in domestic fabrication  recycling and marketing and distribution 
also  we sold million of accounts receivable for the year ended august  as compared to million in see note  sales of accounts receivable  to the consolidated financial statements 
our inventories excluding those acquired with cmcz and lofland increased by million during the year ended august  as compared to an increase of million in the increase was primarily due to higher purchase costs  higher quantities in anticipation of increased sales  and goods in transit 
the majority of the increases were in our marketing and distribution and domestic fabrication segments 
also  our trade accounts payable  accrued expenses  other payables and income taxes excluding lofland and cmcz increased by million during the year ended august  as compared to due primarily to increased inventory purchases and higher discretionary accruals 
the decrease in net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended august  as compared to primarily resulted from lower net earnings in and increases in working capital as a result of increased accounts receivable and inventories 
net sales in the fourth quarter of were significantly higher than in the fourth quarter of the previous year  resulting in more accounts receivable at year end 
inventories increased in as compared to primarily due to higher costs and higher inventory quantities at the minimills and our steel fabrication and post plants 
excluding the acquisitions of lofland and cmcz  we invested million in property  plant and equipment during the year ended august   which was slightly more than during and we expect our capital spending for fiscal to be million 
we assess our capital spending each quarter and reevaluate our requirements based upon current and expected results 
in november  we issued million of long term notes due in the proceeds from this offering were used to purchase million of our notes otherwise due in and finance our purchases of cmcz and lofland 
in march  we refinanced million of cmcz s notes payable that we had assumed in our acquisition through the issuance of a long term note and a revolving credit facility 
also during  we obtained more extended payment terms through the use of discounted documentary letters of credit rather than through more traditional extended terms with our trade suppliers 
in october  we entered into a trade financing arrangement to enable us to provide a low risk million advance to one of our key suppliers 
the advance was partially repaid during as the supplier delivered the materials that we purchased under a related supply agreement 
at august    common shares were issued and outstanding  with  held in our treasury 
during the year ended august   we received million from stock issued under our employee incentive and stock purchase plans as compared to million in and million in we purchased  shares of our common stock during the year ended august  at per share as compared to  shares at per share in we paid dividends of million during the year ended august   approximately the same amount as we paid during in june  we increased our quarterly cash dividend by to cents per common share 
during our fiscal year ending august   we will repay million in long term debt principal when it matures in july our million short term trade financing arrangement will be self liquidating with cash flows from our operating activities 
we believe that our cash flows from operating activities will continue to provide liquidity during in addition  at august  we had million and million unused capacity under our domestic accounts receivable securitization and commercial paper 
table of contents programs  respectively 
therefore  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our contractual obligations of million over the next twelve months  the majority of which are expenditures associated with normal revenue producing activities and to make our planned capital expenditures of million 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of august  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt trade financing arrangement interest operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we have not discounted the cash obligations in this table 
total amounts are included in the august  consolidated balance sheet 
see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
payments will be due only if steel is delivered in conformance with the related supply agreement  for which purchase prices are negotiated in advance of each delivery 
interest payments related to our short term debt are not included in the table as they do not represent a significant obligation as of august  includes minimum lease payment obligations for non cancelable equipment and real estate leases in effect as of august  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
about of these purchase obligations are for inventory items to be sold in the ordinary course of business 
in august  we adopted financial reporting release no 
 disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
as a result  purchase obligations now include all enforceable  legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms  regardless of the duration of the agreement 
agreements with variable terms are excluded because we are unable to estimate the minimum amounts 
other commercial commitments we maintain stand by letters of credit to provide support for certain transactions that our customers or suppliers request 
at august   we had committed million under these arrangements 
all commitments expire within one year 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the estimable probable impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations or our financial position 
however  they may have a material impact on earnings for a particular quarter 
environmental and other matters see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents general we are subject to federal  state and local pollution control laws and regulations 
we anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will involve continuing capital expenditures and operating costs 
our original business and one of our core businesses for over eight decades is metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  we are committed to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain governmental regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  are contrary to the goal of greater recycling 
such regulations expose us and the industry to potentially significant risks 
we believe that recycled materials are commodities that are diverted by recyclers  such as us  from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 
environmental agencies at various federal and state levels classify certain recycled materials as hazardous substances and subject recyclers to material remediation costs  fines and penalties 
taken to extremes  such actions could cripple the recycling industry and undermine any national goal of material conservation 
enforcement  interpretation  and litigation involving these regulations are not well developed 
solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease  and in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used in our operations 
although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of several such properties 
state and federal laws applicable to wastes and contaminated properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under new laws  we could be required to remediate properties impacted by previously disposed wastes 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party at a number of contaminated sites 
we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state and or local statutes where we operate 
these statutes  regulations and laws may have limited disposal options for certain wastes 
superfund the us environmental protection agency epa or an equivalent state agency notified us that we are considered a potentially responsible party prp at fifteen sites  none owned by us 
we may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla or a similar state statute to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
we are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting  or at the appropriate time we may contest  our liability at the sites 
in addition  we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
because of various factors  including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the extended time periods over which such costs may be incurred  we cannot reasonably estimate our ultimate costs of compliance with cercla 
at august   based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  we believe that our aggregate liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with nine of the fifteen sites will be between million and million 
we have accrued for these liabilities based upon our best estimates 
we are not able to estimate the possible range of loss on the other sites 
the amounts paid and the expenses incurred on these fifteen sites for the year ended august  were not material 
historically  the amounts that we have ultimately paid for such remediation activities have not been material 
clean water act the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined 
these controls have become more stringent over time and it is probable that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future 
permits must generally be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters  comparable permits may be required at the state level 
the cwa and many state agencies provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties 
table of contents for unauthorized discharges of pollutants 
in addition  the epa has promulgated regulations that may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
clean air act our operations are subject to regulations at the federal  state and local level for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution 
new and modified sources of air pollutants are often required to obtain permits prior to commencing construction  modification and or operations 
major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent requirements  including the potential need for additional permits and to increased scrutiny in the context of enforcement 
the epa has been implementing its stationary emission control program through expanded enforcement of the new source review program 
under this program  new or modified sources are required to construct what is referred to as the best available control technology 
additionally  the epa is implementing new  more stringent standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
the epa recently has promulgated new national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for steel mills which will require all major sources in this category to meet the standards by reflecting application of maximum achievable control technology 
compliance with the new standards could require additional expenditures 
in fiscal  we incurred environmental expenses of million 
the expenses included the cost of environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessments  remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
approximately million of our capital expenditures for related to costs directly associated with environmental compliance 
at august   million was accrued for environmental liabilities of which million was classified as other long term liabilities 
business interruption insurance claims and unclaimed property see note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
dividends we have paid quarterly cash dividends in each of the past consecutive years 
we paid dividends in at the rate of cents per share for the first three quarters and cents per share for the fourth quarter

also  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
the following types of derivative instruments were outstanding at august   in accordance with our risk management program 
currency exchange forwards we enter into currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of international trade commitments denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  or  if the transaction involves our australian or european subsidiaries  their local currency 
no single foreign currency poses a primary risk to us 
fluctuations that cause temporary disruptions in one market segment tend to open opportunities in other segments 
commodity prices we base pricing in some of our sales and purchase contracts on forward metal commodity exchange quotes which we determine at the beginning of the contract 
due to the volatility of the metal commodity indexes  we enter into metal commodity forward or futures contracts for copper  aluminum and zinc 
these forwards or futures mitigate the risk of unanticipated declines in gross margins on these contractual commitments 
physical transaction quantities will not match exactly with standard commodity lot sizes  leading to small gains and losses from ineffectiveness 
interest rate swaps see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements regarding our strategy for managing the fluctuations in interest rates on our long term debt 
if interest rates increased or decreased by one percentage point  the effect on interest expense related to our variable rate debt and the fair value of our long term debt would be approximately thousand and million  respectively
