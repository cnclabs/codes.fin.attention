additionally  stock options were exercised during the fiscal year ended june  providing the company with additional cash 
changes in escalon s overall liquidity and capital resources from continuing operations during fiscal are reflected in the following table june  june  dollars are in thousands current assets   less current liabilities   working capital  current ratio to to notes payable and current maturities   long term debt   total debt   total equity   total capital   total debt to total capital working capital position working capital increased  as of june  and the current ratio increased to to when compared with june  current assets increased by  primarily due to the issuance of common stock totaling  current liabilities decreased by  as a result of several offsetting factors that included the following a  decrease in the escalon s outstanding line of credit as the company used cash from operations to pay down its debt

cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased  to  for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  apart from year over year increased net profitability of  the following are the primary offsetting factors affecting the increase in net cash provided by operating activities the company held overall inventory levels relatively constant as compared to fiscal when the company increased overall inventory levels to be more quickly responsive to customer orders

otherwise  cash flows used in investing activities related solely to the purchase of fixed assets for the fiscal year ended june  and  and remained largely unchanged 
any necessary capital expenditures have generally been funded out of cash from operations  and the company is not aware of any factors that would cause historical capital expenditure levels not to be indicative of capital expenditures in the future and  accordingly  does not believe that it will have to commit material resources to capital investment for the foreseeable future 
cash flows from financing activities were  for the fiscal year ended june  cash flows from financing activities primarily related to proceeds from a private placement of common stock and common stock warrants as well as proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options

the reduction in repayments of term debt relates to a reduction in required principal payments that resulted from the company s renegotiating its debt in february management believes that cash on hand  cash generated from operations and cash available from the line of credit  as of june  should be sufficient to satisfy the company s including drew working capital  debt service  capital expenditures and research and development costs for the foreseeable future 
forward looking statement about significant items likely to affect liquidity as of july   escalon acquired of the outstanding ordinary shares of drew  pursuant to the company s exchange offer for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of drew  and since that date has acquired approximately of the drew shares 
escalon expects to acquire the remaining outstanding drew shares pursuant to procedures under united kingdom laws and regulations 
drew does not have a history of producing positive operating cash flows and  as a result  at the time of acquisition  was operating under financial constraints and was under capitalized and is expected to negatively impact the company s financial results in the short term 
as of september   escalon loaned  to drew 
the funds have been primarily used to procure components to build up inventory to support the manufacturing process 
as drew is integrated into the company  management will be working to reverse the situation  while at the same time strengthening drew s market position 
escalon realized and of its net revenue during the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  from bausch lomb s sale of silicone oil 
silicone oil revenue is based on sales of the product by bausch lomb multiplied by a contractual factor that reduces on an annual basis due to a contractual step down provision 
while the company does not expect total silicone oil revenue to decline rapidly during the remainder of the contract  any such decrease would have an impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows and the company s stock price could be negatively impacted 
the company is entitled to receive this revenue from bausch lomb  in varying amounts  through august  when all revenues will cease

as of june   escalon complied with these requirements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the most significant of those involve the application of sfas no 
 discussed further in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and  as such  include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management 
for example  estimates are used in determining valuation allowances for uncollectible receivables  obsolete inventory  sales returns and rebates  deferred income taxes and purchased intangible assets 
actual results achieved in the future could differ from current estimates 
the company used what it believes are reasonable assumptions and  where applicable  established valuation techniques in making its estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of shipment  when title and risk of loss transfer 
the company provides products to its distributors at agreed wholesale prices and to the balance of its customers at set retail prices 
distributors can receive discounts for accepting high volume shipments 
the discounts are reflected immediately in the net invoice price  which is the basis for revenue recognition 
no further material discounts or sales incentives are given 
the company s considerations for recognizing revenue upon shipment of product to a distributor are based on the following persuasive evidence that an arrangement purchase order and sales invoice exists between a willing buyer distributor and the company that outlines the terms of the sale company information  quantity of goods  purchase price and payment terms 
the buyer distributor does not have an immediate right of return 
shipping terms are ex factory shipping point 
at this point the buyer distributor takes title to the goods and is responsible for all risks and rewards of ownership  including insuring the goods as necessary 
the company s price to the buyer distributor is fixed and determinable as specifically outlined on the sales invoice 
the sales arrangement does not have customer cancellation or termination clauses 
the buyer distributor places a purchase order with the company  the terms of the sale are cash  cod or credit 
customer credit is determined based on the company s policy and procedures related to the buyer s distributor s creditworthiness 
based on this determination  the company believes that collectibility is reasonably assured 
escalon assesses collectibility based on credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral from its customers 
for many of escalon s international customers  the company requires an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
valuation of intangible assets escalon annually evaluates for impairment its intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
these intangible assets include goodwill  trademarks and trade names 
factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
no impairment losses were recorded for goodwill  trademarks and trade names during any of the periods presented based on these evaluations 
taxes estimates of full year taxable income of the various legal entities and jurisdictions are used in the tax rate calculation 
management uses judgment in estimating what the company s income will be for the year 
since judgment is involved  there is risk that the tax rate may significantly increase or decrease in any period 
in determining income loss for financial statement purposes  management must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating the escalon s ability to recover the company s deferred tax assets management considers all available positive and negative evidence including the company s past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses  and near term forecasts of future taxable income  management develops assumptions which require significant judgment about the near term forecasts of future taxable income which are consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to manage the underlying businesses 
through june   the escalon has recorded a full valuation allowance against the company s net operating losses due to the uncertainty of their realization as a result of the company s earnings history  cumulative historical losses  the number of years the company s operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward  the existence of taxable temporary differences  and near term earnings expectations 
the amount of the valuation allowance could decrease if facts and circumstances change that materially increase taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
any reduction would reduce increase the income tax expense benefit in the period such determination is made by the company 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations escalon did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of and for the fiscal years ended june  and the following table presents the company s contractual obligations as of june  less than more than total year years years years long term debt    operating lease obligations      purchase obligations   item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the table below provides information about escalon s financial instruments  consisting primarily of debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table represents principal cash flows and related interest rates by expected maturity dates 
interest rates are based on the prime rate at june  plus on the term loan  the prime rate plus on the line of credit and the prime rate plus on the endologix note

prior to the acquisition of drew  the price of all product sold overseas was denominated in united states dollars and consequently the company incurred no exchange rate risk on revenue 
the company s sonomed business unit began incurring marketing expenses in the european market during the second quarter of fiscal  the majority of which are transacted in euros 
these expenses were  and  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the company s vascular business began incurring marketing expenses in the european market during the second quarter of fiscal  the majority of which are transacted euros 
these expenses were  for the fiscal year ended june  additionally  the company acquired the majority of drew on july  drew has a facility in the united kingdom  and therefore transacts a portion of its operations in united kingdom pounds 
consequently  the company may begin to experience fluctuations  beneficial or adverse  in the valuation of the currencies in which the company transacts its business  namely the united states dollar  the united kingdom pound and the euro
