strategy overview we currently have several strategic initiatives underway to increase our operating income and return maximum value to our stockholders 
our four key priorities are as follows continue to improve our value propositions the majority of our product revenue is generated from our data warehousing  financial self service and retail store automation businesses  and leveraging our market leadership and value propositions in these businesses is important to ncr s future success 
the strategies for these businesses are focused on gaining market share and reallocating spending to value added activities within our product offerings to generate revenue and operating income growth 
we are also making investments in research and development activities to generate new product ideas that will be successful in the marketplace 
we will track our progress for these strategies through market share metrics 
please refer to the sections in this md a discussing each of these businesses for more information on these strategies 
enhance demand creation growing revenue through demand is critical to our overall success 
we are investing in our sales force through the hiring of additional sales people and increasing our training offerings 
these investments are being monitored through metrics such as number of employees dedicated to demand creation  demand productivity per sales person and funnel of sales activity 
while we do not believe that overall revenue growth will be immediate  we expect the implementation of these strategies should provide us benefits in and beyond 
improve performance in customer services in our customer services division  we plan on driving operational and financial performance by lowering our service delivery costs and increasing our focus on the linkage between product engineering and product serviceability 
these goals are being monitored through metrics such as maintenance revenue per service call  maintenance service capture rate of ncr products  and cost reduction measures 
please refer to the customer services section in this md a for further details on these initiatives 
continue to reduce our cost structure in  we made progress on reducing our cost structure to bring it in line with industry benchmark standards  although much work remains 
our goal is to lower annualized costs and expenses  using the results as a starting point  so that million of annualized savings is realized in our progress will be monitored by measuring actual savings versus plan 
please refer to the restructuring and re engineering section in this md a for further details on our cost reductions 
financial overview was a year of positive transition for ncr as we made key strategic decisions in order to generate future revenue and operating income growth 
as more fully discussed in later sections of md a  the following were the significant themes and events for while our revenue growth was constrained by the continuation of the depressed capital spending environment characterized by delays in customer purchasing decisions  the company benefited from fluctuations in the value of the euro and other currencies against the us dollar 
in general  we continued to strengthen the value of our products and services provided to our customers around the world in order to maintain our revenue levels in we successfully executed the first half of our eight quarter plan to improve operational efficiencies and reduce our cost structure 
in  we reduced our costs and expenses by more than million 

table of contents although we have reduced our operational cost structure  operating income continued to decline due to the effects of our pension plans 
we recognized million of pension expense in our operating income compared to million of pension income in as a result of new information released by various government agencies in and other developments  we recognized million of net pre tax expense in order to increase our reserves for the fox river environmental matter 
our liquidity and capital resources improved significantly during the year as our net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  and we reduced our capital expenditures by million 
in  we established six key value drivers in order to improve and measure our overall success 
these drivers and our results against them were as follows data warehousing revenue growth although our data warehousing business had revenue growth in the fourth quarter  we missed our plan of achieving full year revenue growth 
despite the slight decline in revenue  operating income increased in financial self service revenue growth financial self service executed its plan and delivered revenue growth during the year  although the revenue growth was mainly due to foreign currency fluctuations 
retail store automation profitability retail store automation s financial results were significantly improved from the million loss in  however  there is much work to be done to reach the profitability levels we believe this business can achieve 
customer services revenue growth this business revenue growth was greater than planned  but the main driver of the increase was foreign currency fluctuations 
customer services profitability improvement profitability for this business continued to decline in due to price erosion and declines in exited businesses revenue that more than offset cost reductions driven by operational efficiencies 
operational improvements during and the execution of our services transformation roadmap in future periods should translate into improved financial results over the next few years 
cost and expense reductions as mentioned above  we made significant progress in this area in relation to our plan 
these drivers are discussed in greater detail later in this md a 
our key drivers for are similar to those shown above  except we will combine our revenue and profitability drivers for customer services in as we intensify our focus on profitably growing this business 
we are projecting that the capital spending environment experienced in will be roughly the same or slightly improved in even with the investments we are currently making in our value proposition and demand creation strategies  we are forecasting revenue to be relatively flat with revenue 
we believe the strategies we are implementing now will be the core foundation for growth in the future 
our operating income will be constrained by increased pension expense  which we expect to be million for the year 
as a result of our projected improvement in operating performance  which will be partially offset by pension expense  we expect our net income to be slightly improved from our results 
we see the following as the most significant risks to the execution of our initiatives executing our customer services transformation process it is critical for ncr to structure this business so that it can obtain meaningful revenue growth and substantially improved profitability 
our transformation process may be at risk if we cannot successfully meet our plan objectives  described in the customer services segment discussion of this md a  and if we cannot overcome the negative effect of pricing pressures we experienced in capital spending environment if the overall capital spending environment declines  we may not be able to profitably grow our business and meet our objectives 
impact of pension expense changes in actuarial assumptions and declines in the capital markets for both ncr s us and international pension plans may result in more pension expense in future periods than anticipated  which could hurt our overall profitability 
while changes in actuarial assumptions may have a more immediate effect on 
table of contents our pension expense  changes in the capital markets may affect our net income in following years 
we are continuing to analyze all costs and benefits associated with our current pension plan arrangements  including whether to make any changes in the future to the plans 
cost structure minimization if we cannot continue to remove costs and expenses from our infrastructure and business units  we may not be competitive in our solution pricing and may not be able to create the capacity to invest in new solutions

compared to results discussion total revenue was essentially flat in as compared to foreign currency fluctuations provided a percentage point benefit to revenue 
overall  increases in customer service revenue were essentially offset by a decline in product sales and professional services due to the constrained capital spending environment for information technology equipment 
by segment  revenue growth in retail store automation  financial self service  and customer services was offset by declines in the other segment  systemedia  and data warehousing 
please refer to the revenue and operating income loss by segment section in this md a for details on these fluctuations 
revenue growth of in the emea region was offset by declines of in the americas region  in japan and in the asia pacific region 
the growth in the emea region was primarily due to positive foreign currency impact and higher volumes in financial self service and retail store automation 
the decline in the asia pacific region was mainly due to a volume decline as our significant growth from for financial self service and retail store automation was not sustained in changes in foreign currency rates provided a percentage point  a percentage point  and a percentage point benefit to the revenue in the emea region  the japan region  and the asia pacific region  respectively 
total operating income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
operating income for was impacted by million of pension expense compared to million and million of pension income for and  respectively 
the million of pension expense for included million of incremental settlement charges for departures of employees in certain non us locations 
operating income for was positively impacted by our cost and expense reduction initiatives  the benefit of positive foreign currency fluctuations  and higher revenues in data warehousing support services 
also during the year  a million benefit was realized as we eliminated our us postretirement life insurance benefit in the third quarter of compared to results discussion total revenue decreased in from foreign currency fluctuations provided a percentage point benefit to revenues 
the revenue decline in was primarily attributed to lower revenue from exited businesses and the impact of depressed information technology it capital spending 
this adverse capital spending environment impacted our customer services and retail store automation businesses while weakness in the european economy and lower 
table of contents upgrade activity following the euro conversion on january  specifically affected our financial self service solutions 
these declines were partially offset by improved performance from data warehousing in the americas and emea regions  as well as the continued success of financial self service in the asia pacific region 
total revenue declines in of in the americas region  in the emea region and in japan were partially offset by growth in the asia pacific region of 
changes in foreign currency rates provided a percentage point and a percentage point benefit to the revenue in the emea region and the asia pacific region  respectively  and a percentage point detriment to the japan region s revenue 
in  total operating income included million of asset impairment charges and million of real estate consolidation and restructuring charges 
in  total operating income included the impact of million of goodwill amortization 
operating income growth for was limited due to lower revenue relating to exited businesses  margin erosion due to competitive pressure  and lower product revenue 
revenue and operating income loss by segment our key solutions are categorized as data warehousing  financial self service  retail store automation and customer services  each of which is a reportable operating segment 
in addition  our systemedia and payment and imaging solutions are reportable segments 
a seventh segment  other  primarily relates to the company s resale of third party computer hardware and related professional and installation services  and to a business in japan that is not aligned with our other segments 
our segments are comprised of hardware  software  and professional and installation related services 
for purposes of discussing our operating results by segment  we exclude the impact of certain items from operating income or loss  consistent with the manner by which management views each segment and reports our operating segment results under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this format is useful to investors because it allows analysis and comparability of operating trends 
it also includes the same information that is used by ncr management to make decisions regarding the segments and to assess our financial performance 
the effects of pension expense income  the goodwill amortization expense in in order to provide a comparison to other periods  and other specific items from and as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements have been excluded from the operating income loss for each reporting segment presented and discussed below 
our segment results are reconciled to total company results reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america otherwise known as gaap in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the segment discussions  we have disclosed the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as it relates to our segment revenue due to its significance during the year 
as a result of the weaker us dollar  the company benefited from currency fluctuations  mainly in our emea  japan and asia pacific regions 
data warehousing provides the market leading teradata data warehousing database software  hardware platform and related services that enable companies to gain a competitive advantage by more quickly and efficiently analyzing customer behavior and other business information and then delivering that business intelligence to the company s decision makers 
this segment s revenues are primarily generated in the enterprise data warehousing market  which is part of the larger database market 
the current business and financial model for data warehousing allows for a significant portion of incremental revenue to enhance profitability 
profitability improvement has been accomplished through gross margin increases due to a shift in our revenue mix to higher percentages of software and services than hardware  along with product cost reductions 
also  our expense management strategy is focused on reallocating unnecessary infrastructure costs to our sales and research and development initiatives 
our main strategic direction for the future is to increase our market share in the enterprise data warehouse market and to increase our penetration in the overall data warehousing market 
we are focusing on adding customers who will routinely upgrade the size and scope of their data warehouses 
we plan to meet these goals by providing the technology and support and consulting services companies need to capitalize on enterprise wide analytics and maximize the usefulness of their existing data 
we believe that expanding our customer base is also important as sales to new customers typically generate incremental revenue in the future from product upgrades and support services 
the following table presents data warehousing including support services revenue and operating income loss for the years ended december in millions data warehousing revenue data warehousing operating income loss operating income loss as a percent of revenue 
table of contents data warehousing revenue declined in from due to the constrained capital expenditure environment  which was partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations and an increase in support services revenue 
foreign currency fluctuations provided a percentage point increase to revenue 
the capital spending environment remained depressed in as customers had limited budgets for large information technology expenditures  however  our existing customer base continued to purchase services to maintain their data warehouses 
operating income increased in as cost and expense reduction efforts provided benefits to our margin and operating expenses that offset the effects of lower volumes and typical price erosion 
we also experienced a positive shift in our mix during to higher margin software and services revenue from hardware  which aided our operating income improvement 
data warehousing revenue increased in compared to  outpacing the industry despite the challenging economic environment 
during  data warehousing increased product revenues as a result of existing customers upgrading their data warehouses and growth from new customer sales 
data warehousing generated significant year over year growth in the insurance  communications  government and retail sectors 
in addition  hardware and software support services revenue increased as a result of growth in our installed customer base 
operating income improved to million in  compared to an operating loss of million in  primarily attributed to reductions in costs and expenses not aligned to demand creation activities  as well as higher product and maintenance revenues 
due to forecasted capital spending constraints in the information technology market in  we expect our products and related installation services revenue to grow slightly versus our support services revenue is expected to increase in as our installed customer base increases  but potentially not at the same pace as prior years due to lower product sales 
our growth in support services revenue combined with our continued cost and expense reductions should lead to higher operating income versus for this business 
financial self service provides self service devices  which include atms  cash dispensers  and services and software solutions  including the aptra application suite  to financial institutions and retailers 
our financial self service solutions are designed to quickly and reliably process high volumes of consumer transactions and incorporate advanced features such as web enablement  automated check cashing deposit  automated cash deposit  bill payment and the dispensing of non cash items 
the market demand for financial self service products and services is expected to grow slightly over the next few years due to an anticipated atm upgrade cycle in the us market and expanding demand in emerging markets 
our strategy is to fully distribute our sales force and invest in growth markets such as china  india  russia  and brazil 
also  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the deposit automation and software market opportunities in order to lead the market in higher value solutions 
additionally  we are progressing towards our goal of making cost a competitive advantage for this business by working to optimize our human and asset capital deployment in order to become a lower cost supplier 
this includes streamlining our supply chain and producing atms in the region generating the demand 
a significant event in the financial services marketplace was the signing into law in october of the check clearing for the st century act  or check while this act will have more of a short term effect for our payment and imaging business see discussion below  the financial self service business should realize benefits from it over a longer term 
financial institutions in the united states will more than likely upgrade their atms in order to allow checks to be scanned upon deposit at the atm due to new regulations from the us federal reserve to clear and settle checks electronically instead of the traditional paper based system 
the following table presents financial self service revenue and operating income for the years ended december in millions financial self service revenue financial self service operating income operating income as a percent of revenue revenues in financial self service increased in as compared to primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations 
foreign currency provided a percentage point benefit in for this business 
services revenue included in this segment was higher in  but we experienced typical levels of product price erosion due to competitive pressures 
we experienced strong growth in the americas region as financial institutions increased spending for our advanced function atm solutions  however  the asia pacific region s revenue declined because we did not sustain the high level of growth generated in operating income improved from due to cost 
table of contents and expense reduction programs and positive foreign currency fluctuations 
we have been successful in lowering our supply chain costs with the actions we took in  such as reducing the number of staging centers that customize atms and leveraging our regional manufacturing capabilities 
financial self service revenue decreased in compared to the revenue decrease in was driven by a decline in the emea region  partially offset by increases in the asia pacific and americas regions 
the revenue decline in the emea region was attributed to economic weakness and competitive pressure in europe 
additionally  there were fewer upgrades and purchases of equipment in versus higher levels of upgrades in as financial institutions prepared for the january  conversion to the euro currency 
growth in the americas region was related to upgrades and purchases by top tier banks and eleven s purchase of our advanced function atms 
growth experienced in the asia pacific region was primarily driven by strong markets in china and india as an increasing number of financial institutions in these countries installed atms for the first time 
the operating income decline in versus the prior year was mainly due to lower product revenue and competitive pressure in europe 
in  we expect revenue for financial self service to increase in line with the overall market 
as price competition increases  it is imperative that we continue to reduce our costs through product demand and manufacturing location synergies to maintain or gain market share 
due to these factors  we expect operating income to increase at a rate greater than the growth in revenue as we continue to optimize our cost and expense structure 
retail store automation provides retail oriented technologies such as pos terminals  bar code scanners and software  as well as innovative products such as our self checkout systems  to retailers worldwide 
combining our retail industry expertise  software and hardware technologies  and implementation and store performance consulting services  our retail store automation solutions are designed to enable cost reductions and improve operational efficiency for retailers while increasing customer satisfaction of their customers 
our products and services are part of the retail solutions market  which is expected to grow over the next several years 
over the past year  the retail store automation business has made significant improvements in lowering its cost structure and improving its business model  however  focus in these areas will continue 
ncr provides a competitive product offering for retailers in an increasingly commoditized market 
revenue in this segment will more than likely be driven by increases in pos and bar code scanner products  as retailers go through an overdue upgrade cycle  growth in self checkout and self service technologies  and continued growth in software and services 
with respect to cost and expense reduction  we will continue to execute our supply chain strategy moving from a build to order model to a configure to order model combined with low cost region manufacturing 
we will also continue to reduce our general and administrative expenses as we shift investments from infrastructure costs to sales and development processes 
this includes making investments in new technologies that are projected to increase efficiencies for retailers  such as electronic shelf labels and radio frequency identification rfid tags 
also  we are investing in technology that helps retailers better interact with consumers  such as our copient direct marketing solution  which  based on their prior purchases  allows consumers to receive customized offers or awards while in the retail store 
the following table presents retail store automation revenue and operating income loss for the years ended december in millions retail store automation revenue retail store automation operating income loss operating income loss as a percent of revenue revenue increased for retail store automation in as increased demand and positive foreign currency fluctuations more than offset the price erosion we experienced during the year primarily due to revenues from our pos terminals and scanners 
foreign currency provided a percentage point benefit for revenue 
the higher volumes were mainly driven by sales of ncr fastlane self checkout systems  which were characterized by large  single purchases in the americas region 
the emea and japan regions also contributed to the growth  led by sales of pos terminals and ncr fastlane self checkout systems in these regions 
the significant improvement in operating income was driven mainly by our cost reduction efforts  volume increases  and positive foreign currency impact 
these cost reductions included progress on our configure to order initiative and moving a portion of our product development activities to lower cost locations outside of the united states 
retail store automation revenue decreased in compared to the revenue decline was primarily the result of decreased revenues in the americas and japan regions as retailers continued to delay capital spending 
the operating income decline in was predominately the result of lower revenue  competitive pressures and transition costs relating to our supply chain 

table of contents we expect our revenue for retail store automation solutions to be roughly in line with our revenues 
this will require new customer wins to replace the large purchases from single customers we had in due to our continuing commitment to reduce cost and expense in this business  we expect operating income to increase in systemedia provides printer consumables and products including paper rolls for atms and pos workstations  inkjet and laser printer supplies  thermal transfer ribbons  labels  ink ribbons  laser documents  business forms and retail office products 
systemedia products are designed to reduce paper related failures in our atms and pos terminals and enable businesses to improve transaction accuracy while reducing overall costs 
the printer consumables market is highly fragmented  and market consolidation continues due to lower levels of demand in traditional media products such as paper rolls  fax paper  ink ribbons and forms 
excess capacity and lack of fixed cost coverage results in price competition that often uses only variable cost as its base 
the use of internet auctions and the willingness of customers to set lower paper grade specifications for the products they use also results in price and margin erosion 
to continue to effectively compete in this market  we are shifting our market and application focus to consumable offerings that offer growth opportunities 
these include laser documents  labels  ink jet supplies  laser cartridges  and specialty media 
increased revenue in these products is expected to offset declines experienced in mature products due to the changes in printer technologies 
in addition to a shift to higher growth products  we are also working to increase our use of services and industry expertise 
increased focus on defining value drivers and refining our demand generation capabilities through additional direct sales resources is key to the success of this our strategy 
changing our sales and market focus towards solutions will involve a longer average selling cycle  but should allow us to win more new business and reduce revenue volatility in our base 
we believe we can leverage our global presence  industry knowledge  strong brand recognition  e commerce solutions and ability to bundle service capabilities with products to be successful with this initiative 
our cost reduction efforts in this business have yielded positive results in  and we will continue to review our cost structure and manufacturing efficiency in in order to drive profitability 
the following table presents systemedia revenue and operating income for the years ended december in millions systemedia revenue systemedia operating income operating income as a percent of revenue revenue for the systemedia business declined from due to softness in the market from a pricing and volume perspective as customers reduced their expenditures for printer consumables 
the americas region was impacted the most from the volume decline as customers lost in late and early could not be replaced during the remainder of the year 
foreign currency provided a percentage point benefit to revenue 
operating income for systemedia increased in from due to cost reductions in both our material costs and manufacturing process  which more than outpaced the volume and price erosion impacts 
systemedia revenues increased in compared to in  revenue increased in all regions except the asia pacific region 
operating income improved in versus the prior year predominately due to cost reductions in manufacturing and supply line management 
we expect similar revenue levels in as we generated in  as any gains in growth products are expected to be offset by competition in mature products 
we believe that operating income will continue to increase in due to our cost reduction efforts  but at a reduced rate compared to the increase from to payment and imaging provides end to end solutions for both traditional paper based and image based check and item processing 
our imaging solutions utilize advanced image recognition and workflow technologies to automate item processing  helping financial institutions increase efficiency and reduce operating costs 
consisting of hardware  software  and consulting and support services  our comprehensive payment and imaging solutions enable check and item based transactions to be digitally captured  processed and retained within a flexible  scalable environment 
the most significant event that has occurred in the check payment and imaging marketplace in recent years was the signing into law in october of the check clearing for the st century act  also known as check the act is intended to improve the efficiency of the us federal reserve s current paper based clearing and settlement system through expedited funds availability and reduced risk associated with paper movement 
ncr is well positioned for 
table of contents this change with our current image based solutions and services  however  as the need for digital imaging increases  the reliance on products that were designed for paper based processing will decrease 
revenue growth in this segment will be challenging given these market dynamics 
the following table presents payment and imaging revenue and operating income for the years ended december in millions payment and imaging revenue payment and imaging operating income operating income as a percent of revenue revenue for payment and imaging lagged behind for the majority of the year due to a weakening demand for traditional paper based payment offerings  but a strong fourth quarter of from imaging solution implementations enabled revenues to be in line with foreign currency fluctuations provided a percentage point benefit to revenue 
despite flat revenue  operating income improved by million due to improved operational efficiencies and cost structure reductions 
payment and imaging revenue declined in compared to this decline was largely attributed to the sale of our item processing outsourcing business that contributed million of revenue in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating income increased in compared to primarily related to lower operating expenses 
as financial institutions prepare for check and invest in their check processing infrastructure  we expect a shift to digital imaging products from traditional paper processing products 
the impact of this shift is anticipated to result in lower revenue for  which may lead to lower operating income 
customer services are an essential component of our complete solution offerings 
ncr s customer services division primarily provides maintenance and support services for our base of ncr solution customers 
the maintenance and support services include site design  staging and implementation  and complete systems management 
we believe that customers value the linkage of maintenance and support services with the hardware and software they purchase 
however  heavy competition in the services industry and revenue declines from exited businesses has led to lower revenues and operating margins in our customer services business over the past few years 
our exited businesses relate to higher margin revenue associated with maintenance of computer hardware the company ceased to sell in the s to bank branch automation  account processing and low end server businesses 
we have taken steps to reverse the trend of declining revenue and operating margin through cutting costs  such as reducing the number of call centers we operate  and through operational efficiencies  such as implementing a new dispatching and productivity tool 
although we have realized some cost savings with these actions  it has not been enough to offset price erosion from heavy competition in the marketplace and the reduction of higher margin revenue associated with exited businesses 
there is much work to be done to gain the higher operating margins we believe this business can achieve 
we have developed a services transformation process  which is a long term process that should yield improvement over time 
the main operational goals in this process are increase the focus on the linkage between product engineering and servicing the product  further reduce the cost infrastructure and service delivery costs  limit access of parts to authorized service providers  improve the maintenance capture rate on ncr products  and adjust our go to market strategy to increase revenues from managed services 
by proactively designing products for more efficient serviceability  our product design and engineering teams will be able to modify products to enable a reduction in time spent on service incidents 
this will help us achieve a lower cost structure by shifting our service model to diagnose incidents remotely and then dispatch personnel through a global operating model that takes advantage of personnel and incident location synergies as necessary 
also  we will continue to evaluate the number of customer call centers we maintain and modify their operations to enhance our remote diagnostic capabilities 
we believe these changes will lead to increased customer satisfaction through faster service and reduce our service delivery costs 
revenue and operating income growth is also expected to be facilitated by controlling who has access to our service parts in the resale market  which should improve our win rate for maintenance contracts for ncr products and our 
table of contents managed services model 
by limiting our service parts to authorized third parties  we will be better positioned to maintain appropriate margins 
also  we believe we can be more competitive in the marketplace by concentrating on servicing ncr products rather than focusing on incremental services from third party products 
the migration to a managed services model consists of multi year annuity contracts in which we take on responsibility for operating or managing specific information technology functions 
this will combine many of the services we offer today into one offering  which will deliver strategic value and one point of contact for our customers 
the following table presents customer services revenue and operating income for the years ended december in millions customer services revenue customer services operating income operating income as a percent of revenue revenues for customer services increased in mainly driven by foreign currency fluctuations that provided a percentage point benefit 
we continue to experience declining higher margin exited businesses revenue and price erosion on continuing business due to competition 
operating income in declined from as cost and expense reductions were not able to offset declines in volume from exited businesses and price erosion factors 
customer services revenue declined in compared to this decline was largely due to lower maintenance revenue relating to exited businesses  lower professional services and installation related services due to lower overall company revenues and softness in the third party contracts market 
the operating income decline in was primarily due to lower maintenance revenue from our exited businesses and margin erosion 
customer services segment revenue is expected to decrease from to as competition and declines in maintenance revenues from exited businesses continue to limit our ability to generate growth 
we expect the declining revenues from our exited businesses to be minimal after operating income in is expected to remain relatively flat to slightly improved as compared to as operational efficiency gains may be offset by continued pricing pressure and declining revenues related to exited businesses 
ncr s other business segment primarily relates to the resale of third party computer hardware and related professional and installation services in our high availability and networking services businesses 
also included in this segment are the financial results from a business in japan that is not aligned with any of our other segments 
the following table presents other segment revenue and total operating losses for the years ended december in millions other segment revenue other segment operating loss operating loss as a percent of revenue revenue continues to decline in this segment as we concentrate on reducing our third party product sales in order to concentrate on sales of our own product brands 
the decline is compounded because of lower installation revenue associated with these non ncr product sales 
our revenues should continue this trend  however  the operating loss for is expected to be similar to as cost structure improvements should offset the effects of lower volumes 
restructuring and re engineering in the third quarter of  we announced re engineering plans to drive operational efficiency throughout ncr 
we are targeting process improvements to drive simplification  standardization  globalization and consistency across the organization 
key business processes and supporting functions are being evaluated to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations  many of which have been described above 
during  our success in reducing costs and expenses put us ahead of schedule to deliver million of annualized cost savings in  using results as a starting point 
in addition to the activities described above in our businesses  we are making changes in our infrastructure to bring our costs in line with industry benchmarks 
regarding ncr s internal information technology  we are continuing to replace all major company applications  migrating from country centric applications to new enterprise applications such as our enterprise resource planning erp system  our global human resources system  
table of contents and our teradata enterprise data warehouse 
our erp implementation is on schedule as we went live in our us locations in the third quarter of and will have the majority of our emea locations converted by the end of in our human resources organization  we have improved efficiencies and reduced costs by centralizing our staffing organization and controlling our external recruitment expenses 
in our finance and administration area  we are reorganizing and reducing our workforce to a lower cost structure 
ncr has entered into a service agreement with accenture llp accenture  a global outsourcing services provider  under which many of ncr s key transaction processing activities  including overall processes and day to day responsibility for order and revenue processing  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and the company s general ledger function  will be performed by accenture 
the transition of responsibility for these activities began in the fourth quarter of  and will continue throughout and into as part of this transition  ncr s transaction processing activities will be streamlined and standardized for improved efficiency and consistency of practices globally 
as a result  we expect to reduce significantly our overall finance and administration costs and optimize the use of global centers for transaction processing 
while we have many ongoing projects in relation to our re engineering plans  maintaining the highest levels of internal control effectiveness is critical to our business 
this will be especially poignant in and beyond as we work to certify our internal control effectiveness in response to the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of ongoing business process initiatives  such as the movement towards global processes  the implementation of an erp system  and the transition of key transaction processing activities and functions to accenture  add to the task of meeting our certification requirements 
ncr s management is focused on mitigating the risks involving these changes through conscientious design and review of our internal control structure as we proceed with these initiatives 
also in connection with these efforts  a real estate consolidation and restructuring plan was designed to accelerate our re engineering and consolidation strategies 
for the year ended december   we reduced our number of properties by  representing a reduction of total properties from  for a million square footage reduction 
we will continue to reduce excess square footage through better utilization of current space  increasing the use of virtual offices and the sale of under utilized facilities  although the reduction in number of properties may be lower in future periods as compared to our restructuring plan included recording a restructuring charge of million pre tax in under guidance from emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
during  we utilized million of the reserve and recorded additional provisions of million 
the additional provisions were necessary due to changes in our original sublease and assignment assumptions 
the inability to dispose of our lease liabilities for these facilities as planned was because of a downturn in the real estate markets where these properties are located 
although we exited all of the facilities in  we now project that the majority of the lease obligations will continue through  with one remaining obligation continuing to effects of pension  postemployment  and postretirement benefit plans cost of revenue and total expenses for the years ended december were impacted by certain employee benefit plans as shown below in millions pension expense income postemployment expense postretirement expense net expense income during the year ended december   we recorded million of pension expense versus a million benefit in the negative change was due primarily to the impact of the investment performance of our pension fund portfolio in the difficult market environments during and and changes primarily in the discount rate and return on assets assumptions 
we expect pension expense of approximately million in in  global capital market developments resulted in a positive return on investment for ncr s us qualified pension fund 
as a result  the accumulated benefit obligation for that plan no longer exceeded the fair value of plan assets  and ncr was able to substantially reverse the additional minimum pension liability originally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at the end of the effect of this favorable million pre tax adjustment increased prepaid pension costs by million  decreased pension liabilities by million  decreased intangible assets by million  decreased deferred taxes by million and increased other comprehensive income by million 
this 
table of contents non cash item did not affect our earnings  cash flow or debt covenants  nor did it otherwise impact the business operations of the company 
postemployment expense severance  disability and medical increased to million for the year ended december   versus million in this increase in expense was mainly due to higher long term and short term disability claims as well as lower discount rates in many countries in expense increased million for the year ended december   versus the comparable period in this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase resulting from a change in the assumed demographic mix of our involuntary employee turnover 
the change was made based on actual recent experience factors 
postretirement plan expense medical and life insurance for the year ended december   was million versus million in the decrease in expense was primarily due to the elimination of the us postretirement life insurance benefit  which resulted in a million curtailment gain in the third quarter of in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of became law in the united states 
this new law will not have any material impact on ncr s postretirement plan liabilities or expense as the company does not provide prescription drug benefits to its medicare eligible retirees 
gross margin in  gross margin as a percentage of total revenue declined to from in while our product gross margin showed a percentage point improvement  services margin decreased percentage points 
product gross margin increased due to higher margins in retail store automation from higher revenues and cost reductions  improved margins in data warehousing from a favorable mix shift to higher margin software  and volume increases and cost reduction measures in financial self service 
the decline in services margin is primarily due to the inclusion of million of pension expense in versus million of pension income in this decline was also affected by lower revenues from exited businesses and price erosion 
partially offsetting the decline were cost reductions in customer services  increases in our service margins in financial self service due to higher volumes from professional and installation related services  such as product upgrades and software development  and higher revenues in data warehousing support services 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased percentage points to in from in product gross margin declined percentage points to and services gross margin decreased percentage points to 
in  product gross margin included million of asset impairment charges  and services gross margin included million for real estate restructuring charges 
product gross margin  including the asset impairment charge  declined primarily due to rate declines relating to competitive pressure in retail store automation and financial self service combined with lower volume in retail store automation  partially offset by improved margin performance in data warehousing 
the decline in services gross margin was largely due to the lower revenue from exited businesses  competitive pricing pressure and the impact of the restructuring charge 
operating expenses our operating expenses  characterized as selling  general  and administrative expenses along with research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations  showed a slight increase from operating expenses for were  million compared to  million for the negative impact of pension expense and foreign currency fluctuations was greater than the expense reductions we achieved during the year 
although we reduced non pension operating expenses by million compared to  the savings were offset by pension expense 
our reduction in non pension operating expenses is directly related to the changes discussed in the restructuring and re engineering section in this md a 
for  operating expenses included million of pension expense compared to million of pension income in further constraining any incremental cost savings in was a negative impact on expenses from foreign currency and higher incentive compensation costs compared to  which was directly related to our improved operating performance excluding the effects of pension expense income 
operating expenses in decreased million as compared to mainly due to cost improvements and the curtailment of discretionary spending 
the expenses of  million included million of pension income offset by a million provision for uncollectible loans and receivables related to ccc and million of goodwill amortization  which did not reoccur in due to new accounting standards 
in  we plan to continue reducing our infrastructure costs  however  a portion of our cost savings will be reallocated to improve demand generation capability 
we are committed to new product development and will focus on gaining efficiencies to achieve maximum yield from our research and development spending and resources 
interest and other expense and income items interest expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in interest expense in was due to the issuance in june of million of senior unsecured notes  which are due in 
table of contents the notes carry an interest rate of  however  the rate increased to in november because certain registration requirements under the securities act of were not met 
these registration requirements were met in may  and the interest rate was adjusted to its original fixed rate 
in november  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that essentially converted million of the debt to a variable rate 
although this variable rate was lower than the fixed rate as of december   changes in the interest rate markets could raise the variable rate of the swap above the fixed rate of the debt  which would lead to higher expenses and cash outflows 
the fox river environmental matter has been one of the most significant other expense items we have had over the past three years 
due to the reassessment of the accrual for this potential future liability  we recorded million in and million in in net other expense related to this matter 
the risks and uncertainties associated with this matter are discussed in the environmental and legal contingencies section of the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this md a and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other expense  net  was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
although the expense amounts for and are mainly explained by the charges for the fox river environmental matter  the expense for the year ended december  consisted of several items 
the other expense consisted primarily of a million investment basis write down of marketable securities in japan for losses that were considered to be other than temporary  a million charge relating to an indemnification claim made by lucent technologies  inc lucent  million of real estate consolidation impairment charges and million of costs relating to the disposition of a small non strategic business 
we reversed million of the lucent indemnification charge in the first quarter of  which resulted in a recognition of other income  due to updated information received from lucent as to the actual extent of the claim 
income tax income tax expense was million in compared to income tax expense of million in and income tax benefit of million in the income tax expense in included million for an increase to the valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets of ncr s japanese subsidiaries 
the income tax expense in was reduced by a million benefit relating to the resolution of outstanding issues on refund claims from the us and french governments 
the income tax benefit in included a million benefit resulting from the favorable settlement of audit issues in our and tax years related to a number of international dividend transactions 
these issues had been the subject of dispute between the internal revenue service irs and ncr  therefore  a reserve for these items had been established in prior periods 
upon favorable settlement of the dispute during  the reserve was released 
our effective tax rate was approximately for  and includes the impact of a charge related to the fox river environmental matter and income related to the lucent indemnification claim 
these items provided a percentage point benefit to the effective tax rate for each year  our effective tax rate includes a certain amount of benefit related to the use of foreign tax credits 
for and  the amount of such benefits as compared to the amount of income before tax was larger than prior years 
our effective tax rate was approximately for including the tax impacts relating to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and the benefit from the resolution of outstanding issues on refund claims 
these items provided a percentage point benefit to the effective tax rate for our effective tax rate was approximately for including the impact of the provision for uncollectible loans and receivables related to ccc  acquisition related integration costs  a charge related to the fox river environmental matter  the cumulative effect of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and the benefit from the favorable resolution of international income tax issues described above 
these items provided an percentage point benefit to the effective tax rate 
we anticipate our tax rate will be approximately in cumulative effect of accounting change the cumulative effect of accounting change in was a non cash  net of tax goodwill impairment charge of million which relates to the adoption of sfas the cumulative effect of accounting change in of million relates to the adoption of sfas financial condition  liquidity and capital resources ncr s management uses a non gaap measure called free cash flow  which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  reworkable service parts  and additions to capitalized software  to assess the financial performance of the company 
the components that are used to calculate free cash flow are gaap measures that are directly from the consolidated statement of cash flows 
we believe free cash flow information is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations 
in particular  free cash flow indicates the amount of cash available after capital expenditures for  among other things  investments in the company s existing businesses  
table of contents strategic acquisitions  repurchase of ncr stock and repayment of debt obligations 
this non gaap measure should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  cash flows from operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the table below shows the changes in net cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures for the following years in millions net cash provided by operating activities less net expenditures and proceeds for service parts expenditures for property  plant and equipment additions to capitalized software free cash flow the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was mainly due to the current year impact of our cost and expense reduction initiatives discussed above 
comparatively  our operating cash flows in were also benefited by working capital improvements  namely an increase in current payables and improvements in accounts receivable 
current payables increased as incentive compensation earned in  which will be paid in the first quarter of  was greater than the prior year 
our incentive compensation plans were based on improvements made in operating income without pension expense  which is equal to our measurement of segment operating income as reported in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
also in  we aligned our payment terms by geography and commodity  which resulted in an increase in accounts payable 
accounts receivable increased during  but at a lower amount than the increase  yielding a favorable impact on operating cash flow when compared to the prior year 
the absolute increase in accounts receivable in of million was driven by fourth quarter sales that were million higher than the same period of the prior year 
the impact of this increase in fourth quarter sales was somewhat mitigated by strong fourth quarter cash collections 
partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in inventory and higher pension contributions 
inventory levels increased primarily due to the transition in the retail store automation business to a configure to order manufacturing model  in which a higher dollar amount of component modules instead of individual parts are being carried in inventory 
with regards to our pension plans  as previously noted  there was a million unfavorable change in pension expense income in from however  the cash impact of this change was limited to an increase in contributions to the international and executive pension plans from million in to million in  reflecting increased funding requirements for the international plans 
over the past several years  we have limited our capital expenditures in light of the constrained economic environment 
in  our capital expenditures decreased to million from million in  which is reflective of our continuing commitment to limit discretionary spending 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million  which is slightly below our expected depreciation and amortization expense 
assuming approximately million of capital expenditures  we expect net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures  otherwise defined as free cash flow  to be approximately million in our financing activities in were mainly concentrated on reducing the effects of dilution on our stock 
during  we purchased million of our common stock compared to million in this led to a weighted average diluted share reduction of million in as compared to the share purchases are part of a systematic purchase program authorized by ncr s board of directors 
we will continue this program in  however  the amount of stock purchases may vary from past years depending on the amount of dilution from exercises of stock compensation awards and employee stock purchase plan activity 

table of contents contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual obligations that impact  or could impact  the liquidity of our operations 
the following table and discussion outlines our material obligations at december   with projected cash payments in the years shown in millions total amounts and thereafter debt obligations lease obligations purchase obligations total debt  lease  and purchase obligations at december   we had long term debt totaling million  of which a significant portion is our senior unsecured notes due in as discussed above  million of the notes were converted to a variable rate in november through an interest rate swap agreement 
interest payments for the debt are payable semi annually in arrears on each june and december  and contain certain covenants typical of this type of debt instrument 
our lease obligations are primarily for certain sales and manufacturing facilities in various domestic and international locations 
purchase obligations represent committed purchase orders and other contractual commitments for goods or services 
the purchase obligation amounts were determined through information in our procurement systems and payment schedules for significant contracts 
included in the amounts are committed payments in relation to the long term service agreement with accenture 
we have short and long term liability in relation to the fox river environmental matter that may require future cash payments 
we also have product warranties and several guarantees to third parties that may affect future cash flow 
these items are described in detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our us and international employee benefit plans  which are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  are another area which could require significant future cash payments 
the unfunded status of ncr s us retirement plans improved from million in to million in this improvement resulted from the strong asset returns generated by our pension funds offset somewhat by an increase in benefit obligations due primarily to the reduction in our discount rate assumption and additional benefit accruals 
the unfunded status of our international retirement plans improved slightly from million to million 
asset returns and company contributions both contributed positively to this improvement  but were largely offset by increases in our benefit obligations due to reductions in our discount rate assumptions  additional benefit accruals and foreign currency translation adjustments 
the company did not make any contributions to its us qualified pension plan in  and we will not be required to make any contributions in or contributions to international and executive pension plans are expected to increase from million in to approximately million in this increase is mainly due to additional expected contributions to the international plans 
in october  we renewed a million day unsecured credit facility with a one year term out option with a syndicate of financial institutions 
the day facility coincides with a million  five year unsecured revolving credit facility which we entered into in october the credit facilities contain certain representations and warranties  conditions  affirmative  negative and financial covenants  and events of default customary for such facilities 
interest rates charged on borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities are based on prevailing market rates 
no amounts were outstanding under the facilities at december  and our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million as of december  we believe our cash flows from operations  the credit facilities existing or future arrangements  the senior notes  and other short and long term debt financing  will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital  research and development activities  capital expenditures  pension contributions and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions  competitive pressures  and other business and risk factors described below in factors that may affect future results 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or otherwise comply with the terms of our credit facilities and the senior notes  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or seek additional financing alternatives 
factors that affect future results this report and other documents that we file with the us securities and exchange commission sec  as well as other oral or written statements we may make from time to time  contain information based on management s beliefs 
table of contents and include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of that involve a number of known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance  and there are a number of factors including  but not limited to  those listed below  which could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward looking statements 
we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
economic pressures our business is affected by the global economies in which we operate 
the current economic climate  which includes decreased and or more closely scrutinized capital spending by many industries  could impact our ability to meet our commitments to customers  the ability of our suppliers to meet their commitments to us  the timing of purchases by our current and potential customers  or the ability of our customers to fulfill their obligations to us on a timely basis 
the extent of this impact  if any  is dependent on a number of factors  including the duration of the current economic climate  its effect on the markets and other general economic and business conditions 
competition our ability to compete effectively within the technology industry is critical to our future success 
we operate in the intensely competitive information technology industry 
this industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  price and cost reductions  and increasingly greater commoditization of products  making differentiation difficult 
our competitors include other large companies in the technology industry such as international business machines corporation ibm  oracle corporation  diebold  inc  dell computer corporation dell  wincor nixdorf gmbh co  getronics nv  and unisys corporation  some of which have widespread distribution and penetration of their platforms and service offerings 
in addition  we compete with companies in specific markets such as self checkout  entry level atms  payment and imaging  and business consumables and media products 
we offer a broad suite of consulting and support services across our data warehousing  financial self service  retail store automation and payment and imaging segments 
we compete with companies in consulting and support services  and we partner with companies such as cisco systems  dell  and sun microsystems to deliver it infrastructure services solutions and also other consulting and support services 
our future competitive performance and market position depend on a number of factors  including our ability to react to competitive product and pricing pressures  penetrate developing and emerging markets  such as india and china in the atm business  rapidly and continually design  develop and market  or otherwise maintain and introduce solutions and related products and services for our customers that are competitive in the marketplace  react on a timely basis to shifts in market demands  compete in reverse auctions for new and continuing business  take advantage of data warehousing market demands  reduce costs without creating operating inefficiencies  maintain competitive operating margins  improve product and service delivery quality  and market and sell all of our diverse solutions effectively 
our business and operating performance could be impacted by external competitive pressures  such as increasing price erosion and the addition of competitors  such as dell  to the retail point of sale market 
in addition  our payment and imaging segment is shifting from traditional item processing as check volume and the traditional item processing markets are declining and financial institutions are migrating to a digital process with the potential to clear checks electronically 
this is in response to the check clearing for the st century act commonly referred to as check  which was enacted in october our customers finance many of our product sales through third party financing companies 
in case of customer default  these financing companies may be forced to resell this equipment at discounted prices impacting our ability to sell incremental units 
the impact of these competitive product and pricing pressures could include lower customer satisfaction  decreased demand for our solutions  loss of market share and reduction of operating profits 
operating result fluctuations our revenue and operating results could fluctuate for a number of reasons 
future operating results could continue to be subject to fluctuations based on a variety of factors  including seasonality our sales are historically seasonal  with lower revenue in the first quarter and higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year 
such seasonality also causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume  timing and mix of product sales 
in addition  revenue in the third month of each quarter is typically higher than in the first and second months 
these factors  among other things  make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to predict financial results accurately 
foreign currency our revenue and operating income are subject to variability due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar 
we have exposure to approximately functional currencies  in which our primary exposure is from fluctuations in the euro  british pound  and japanese yen 
due to our global operations  weaknesses in some of these currencies are sometimes offset by strengths in others 
although the foreign currency environment is difficult to predict  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partially mitigated by our hedging strategy 

table of contents cost expense reductions we are actively working to manage our costs and expenses to continue to improve operating profitability without jeopardizing the quality of our products or the efficiencies of our operations 
we are also striving to become a lower cost provider of certain financial self service and retail store automation solutions 
our success in achieving targeted cost and expense reductions depends on a number of factors  including our ability to achieve infrastructure rationalizations  drive lower component costs  improve supply chain efficiencies  improve accounts receivable collections  and reduce inventory overhead  among other things 
if we do not successfully complete our cost reduction initiatives  our results of operation or financial condition could be adversely affected 
contractual obligations of consulting services we maintain a professional services consulting workforce to fulfill contracts that we enter into with our customers that may extend to multiple periods 
our profitability is largely a function of performing to customer contractual arrangements within the estimated costs to perform these obligations 
if we exceed these estimated costs  our services profitability under these contracts may be negatively impacted 
in addition  if we are not able to maintain appropriate utilization rates for our professionals  we may not be able to sustain our services profitability 
acquisitions and divestitures as part of our solutions strategy  we intend to continue to selectively acquire and divest technologies  products and businesses 
as these acquisitions and divestures take place and we begin to include  or exclude as the case may be  the financial results related to these investments  it could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
in february  ncr entered into an agreement in principle to acquire the self checkout business of optimal robotics corp 
optimal and certain of its affiliates for approximately million 
this transaction is subject to  among other items  the approval of optimal s shareholders  and is not expected to close until april if the transaction is finalized  the acquisition is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
pension funds consistent with local competitive practice and regulations  we sponsor pension plans in many of the countries where we do business 
a number of these pension plans are supported by pension fund investments which are subject to financial market risk 
the liabilities and assets of these plans are reported in our financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  employer s accounting for pensions 
in conforming to the requirements of sfas  we are required to make a number of actuarial assumptions for each plan  including expected long term return on plan assets and discount rate 
our future financial results could be materially impacted by volatility in financial market performance and changes in the actuarial assumptions  including those described in our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed below 
consistent with the requirements of paragraphs of sfas  we estimate our discount rate and long term expected rate of return on assets assumptions on a country by country basis after consultation with independent actuarial consultants 
we examine interest rate trends within each country  particularly yields on high quality long term corporate bonds  to determine our discount rate assumptions 
our long term expected rate of return on asset assumptions are developed by considering the asset allocation and implementation strategies employed by each pension fund relative to capital market expectations 
stock option accounting similar to other companies  we use stock options as a form of compensation for certain employees 
currently  the expense of these stock options is not reflected in the operating results under accounting guidance from accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
future operating results could be affected if the financial accounting standards board fasb requires companies to expense stock options or if we elect to do so 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate 
real estate our strategy over the past several years with respect to real estate has been to reduce our holdings of excess real estate 
in line with this strategy  we anticipate the sale of facilities  which may impact net income 
adverse real estate markets could impede our ability to reduce the size of our real estate portfolio 
multinational operations generating substantial revenues from our multinational operations helps to balance our risks and meet our strategic goals 
in  the percentage of revenues from outside of the united states was 

table of contents we believe that our geographic diversity may help to mitigate some risks associated with geographic concentrations of operations eg  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and deteriorating economic environments or business disruptions due to economic or political uncertainties 
however  our ability to sell our solutions domestically in the united states and internationally is subject to the following risks  among others general economic and political conditions in each country which could adversely affect demand for our solutions in these markets  currency exchange rate fluctuations which could result in lower demand for our products as well as generate currency translation losses  changes to and compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations which may increase our cost of doing business in these markets or otherwise prevent us from effectively competing in these markets  and the impact of civil unrest relating to war and terrorist activity on the economy or markets in general  or on our ability  or that of our suppliers  to meet commitments 
introduction of new solutions the solutions we sell are very complex  and we need to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new solutions 
we operate in a competitive  rapidly changing environment  and our future business and operating results depend in part on our ability to develop and introduce new solutions that our customers choose to buy 
the development process for our complex solutions  including our software application development programs and the migration of our teradata data warehousing solution to the latest hardware and software platforms  requires high levels of innovation from both our developers and our suppliers of the components embedded in our solutions 
in addition  the development process can be lengthy and costly  and requires us to commit a significant amount of resources to bring our business solutions to market 
if we are unable to anticipate our customers needs and technological trends accurately  or are otherwise unable to complete development efficiently  we would be unable to introduce new solutions into the market on a timely basis  if at all  and our business and operating results could be impacted 
likewise  we sometimes make assurances to customers regarding new technologies  and our results could be impacted if we are unable to deliver such technologies as planned 
in addition  if we are unable to successfully market and sell both existing and newly developed solutions  such as our advanced function atms and self checkout technologies  and transition our payment and imaging solutions from traditional item processing to imaging  our business and operating results could be impacted 
our solutions  which contain both hardware and software products  may contain known  as well as undetected errors  which may be found after the products introduction and shipment 
while we attempt to remedy errors that we believe would be considered critical by our customers prior to shipment  we may not be able to detect or remedy all such errors  and this could result in lost revenues  delays in customer acceptance and incremental costs  which would all impact our business and operating results 
reliance on third parties third party suppliers provide important elements to our solutions 
in most cases  there are a number of vendors producing the parts and components that we utilize 
however  there are some components that are purchased from single sources due to price  quality  technology or other reasons 
for example  we depend on chips and microprocessors from intel corporation and operating systems from microsoft 
certain parts and components used in the manufacture of our atms and the delivery of many of our retail store automation solutions are also supplied by single sources 
in addition  there are a number of key suppliers for our businesses who provide us with critical products for our solutions 
if we were unable to purchase the necessary parts  components or products from a particular vendor and we had to find an alternative supplier  our new and existing product shipments and solutions deliveries could be delayed  impacting our business and operating results 
we have  from time to time  formed alliances with third parties that have complementary products  software  services and skills 
many different relationships are formed by these alliances  such as outsourcing arrangements to manufacture hardware and subcontract agreements with third parties to perform services and provide products and software to our customers in connection with our solutions 
for example  we rely on third parties for cash replenishment services for our atm products 
also  some of these third parties have access to confidential ncr and customer data  the integrity and security of which we need to ensure 
these alliances introduce risks that we cannot control  such as non performance by third parties and difficulties with or delays in integrating elements provided by third parties into our solutions 
lack of information technology infrastructure  shortages in business capitalization  manual processes and data integrity issues of smaller suppliers can also create product time delays  inventory and invoicing problems and staging delays  as well as other operating issues 
the failure of third parties to provide high quality products or services that conform to required specifications or contractual arrangements could impair the delivery of our solutions on a timely basis  create exposure for non compliance with our contractual commitments to our customers and impact our business and operating results 

table of contents intellectual property as a technology company  our intellectual property portfolio is key to our future ability to be a leading technology and services solutions provider 
to that end  it is critical that we continue to develop leading technologies and work to protect and enhance our proprietary rights in our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
these efforts include protection of the products and application  diagnostic and other software we develop 
to the extent these efforts are not successful  our business could be adversely impacted 
in addition  many of our offerings rely on technologies developed by others  and if we are not able to continue to obtain licenses for such technologies  our business would be impacted 
there has been a recent increase in the issuance of software and business method patents  and more companies are aggressively enforcing their intellectual property rights 
this trend could impact ncr because from time to time we receive notices from third parties regarding patent and other intellectual property claims 
whether such claims are with or without merit  they may require significant resources to defend 
if an infringement claim is successful  in the event we are unable to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non infringing technology  our business could be adversely affected 
work environment restructuring and re engineering as we discussed above  we are implementing a re engineering plan to drive operational efficiency throughout our company 
in order to drive cost and expense out of our businesses  we are rationalizing our infrastructure through real estate and support cost reductions including consolidating a portion of our product development functions to locations outside of the united states  simplifying our front and back office processes by  for example  standardizing global it applications and finance and administration processes  reducing our product costs through design and procurement initiatives  and working to lower our cost of services through completion of a global model for such services 
also  as we move our transaction support processes to accenture  we have mutually agreed to schedules for the transition of work 
an inability to meet the associated timelines or commitments on the part of either ncr or accenture could have a material adverse impact on the company s results from operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
in addition to reducing costs and expenses  our plan includes initiatives to grow revenue  such as improving sales training  addressing sales territory requirements  maintaining and monitoring customer satisfaction with our solutions  and focusing on our strong value propositions 
we currently have many initiatives underway 
if we are not successful in managing these initiatives and minimizing any resulting loss in productivity  our business and operating results could be impacted 
employees our employees are vital to our success 
our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  sales  consulting and other key personnel is critical  as these key employees are difficult to replace 
our current re engineering efforts may adversely impact our workforce 
if we are not able to attract or retain highly qualified employees by offering competitive compensation  secure work environments and leadership opportunities now and in the future  our business and operating results could be impacted 
internal controls accounting policies and practices our internal controls  accounting policies and practices  and internal information systems enable us to capture and process transactions in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  laws and regulations  taxation requirements and federal securities laws and regulations 
we continue to implement the corporate governance  internal control and accounting rules being issued in connection with the sarbanes oxley act of our internal controls and policies are being closely monitored by management as we implement the procedures necessary under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  implement a worldwide erp system  and transition our transaction support functions to accenture 
while we believe these controls  policies  practices and systems are adequate to ensure data integrity  unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees both domestic and international  temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in transition planning and oversight  or resource constraints could lead to improprieties and undetected errors that could impact our financial condition or results of operations 
information systems it is periodically necessary to replace  upgrade or modify our internal information systems 
if we are unable to replace  upgrade or modify such systems in a timely and cost effective manner  especially in light of demands on our information technology resources  our ability to capture and process financial transactions and therefore our financial condition or results of operation may be impacted 
acquisitions and alliances our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or effectively manage alliance activities will help drive future growth 
as part of our overall solutions strategy  we intend to continue to make investments in companies  products  services and technologies  either through acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic alliances 
acquisitions and alliance activities inherently involve risks 
the risks we may encounter include those associated with assimilating and integrating different business operations  corporate cultures  personnel  infrastructures and technologies or products acquired or licensed  and the potential for unknown liabilities within the acquired or combined business 
the investment or alliance may also disrupt our ongoing business  or we may not be able to successfully incorporate acquired products  services or technologies into our solutions and maintain quality 
further  
table of contents we may not achieve the projected synergies once we have integrated the business into our operations 
this may lead to additional costs not anticipated at the time of acquisition 
it is our policy not to discuss or comment upon negotiations regarding such business combinations or divestitures unless they are material and a definitive agreement is signed or circumstances indicate a high degree of probability that a material transaction will be consummated  unless the law requires otherwise 
environmental our historical and ongoing manufacturing activities subject us to environmental exposures 
our facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws  and we have investigatory and remedial activities underway at a number of facilities that we currently own or operate  or formerly owned or operated  to comply  or to determine compliance  with such laws 
given the uncertainties inherent in such activities  there can be no assurances that the costs required to comply with applicable environmental laws will not impact future operating results 
we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with certain environmental matters  including the fox river matter  as further described in environmental matters under note of notes to consolidated financial statements and in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this md a  and we incorporate such disclosures by reference and make them a part of this risk factor 
as described in more detail in such disclosures  we maintain an accrual for our potential liability on the fox river matter which represents certain critical estimates and judgments made by us regarding our potential liability  however  both the ultimate costs associated with the fox river site and our share of those costs are subject to a wide range of potential outcomes 
contingencies like other technology companies  we face uncertainties with regard to regulations  lawsuits and other related matters 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  claims and other matters  including those that relate to the environment  health and safety  employee benefits  export compliance  intellectual property and other regulatory compliance and general matters 
because such matters are subject to many uncertainties  their outcomes are not predictable 
while we believe that amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements are currently adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities  there can be no assurances that the amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from such matters will not impact future operating results 
additionally  we are subject to diverse and complex laws and regulations  including those relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and reporting  which are rapidly changing and subject to many possible changes in the future 
although we do not believe that recent regulatory and legal initiatives will result in significant changes to our internal practices or our operations  rapid changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements including tax rate changes  new tax laws and revised tax interpretations  and federal securities laws and regulations  among others  may substantially increase costs to our organization and could impact our future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
these assumptions  estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
our critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain 
different estimates could have a material impact on our financial results 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or circumstances 
our management continually reviews these estimates and assumptions to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and are materially correct 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require significant management judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the significant accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are discussed in the paragraphs below 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our independent auditors and the audit committee members of our board of directors see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition we are a solutions company which provides our customers with computer hardware  software  professional consulting services and customer support services 
consistent with other companies that provide similar solution offerings  revenue recognition is often complex and subject to multiple accounting pronouncements  including statement of position  software revenue recognition  staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  
table of contents revenue recognition  emerging issues task force no 
issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
we consider revenue realized  or realizable  and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products or services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
please refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our revenue recognition policies 
revenue recognition for complex contractual arrangements requires a greater degree of judgment  including a review of specific contracts  past experience  creditworthiness of customers  international laws and other factors 
changes in judgments about these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized between periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
we establish provisions for doubtful accounts using percentages of our accounts receivable balances as an overall proxy to reflect historical average credit losses and provision for known issues 
these percentages are applied to aged accounts receivable balances 
aged accounts are determined based on the number of days the receivable is outstanding  measured from the date of the invoice  or from the date on which payment is due 
as the age of the receivable increases  the provision percentage also increases 
this policy is applied to all of our operating segments 
based on the factors below  we periodically review customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for potential losses 
factors considered include economic conditions and each customer s payment history and creditworthiness 
judgment is used to assess the collectibility of account balances  and the creditworthiness of a customer 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december was million in  million in  and million in these allowances represent  and of gross receivables for  and  respectively 
the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts between and represents a million provision for uncollectible loans and receivables related to ccc that was recorded in although no near term changes are expected  unforeseen changes to future allowance percentages could materially impact overall financial results 
given our experience  we believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if one or more of our larger customers were to default on its obligations  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established 
if economic conditions worsen  impacting our customers ability to pay  we may increase our reserves for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
each quarter  our business segments reassess raw materials  work in process  parts and finished equipment inventory average costs for purchase or usage variances from standards  and valuation adjustments are made 
additionally  to properly provide for potential exposure due to slow moving  excess  obsolete or unusable inventory  a reserve against inventory is established 
this reserve is established based on forecasted usage  orders  technological obsolescence and inventory aging 
these factors are impacted by market conditions  technology changes  and changes in strategic direction  and require estimates and management judgment that may include elements that are uncertain 
on a quarterly basis  we review the current market value of inventory and require each business segment to ensure that inventory balances are adjusted for any inventory exposure due to age or excess of cost over market value 
we have inventory in more than countries around the world 
we transfer inventory from our plants to our distribution and sales organizations 
this inventory is transferred at cost plus mark up 
this mark up is referred to as inter company profit 
each quarter we review our inventory levels and analyze our inter company profit for each of our segments to determine the amount of inter company profit to eliminate 
key assumptions are made to estimate product gross margins  the product mix of existing inventory balances and current period shipments 
over time  we refine these estimates as facts and circumstances change 
if our estimates require refinement  our results could be impacted 
our excess and obsolete reserves for inventory were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively  and represent  and of our gross inventory balances for each period 
although we strive to achieve a balance between market demands and risk of inventory obsolescence or excess quantities caused by these factors  it is possible that  should conditions change  additional reserves may be needed 
any changes in reserves will impact operating income during a given period 
this policy is consistently applied to all of our operating segments and we do not anticipate any changes to our policy in the near term 
warranty reserves one of our key objectives is to provide superior quality products and services 
to that end  we provide a standard manufacturer s warranty extending up to months such that  should products under warranty require repair  no additional cost of that repair will be charged to our customers 
a corresponding estimated liability for 
table of contents potential warranty costs is also recorded at the time of the sale 
we sometimes offer extended warranties to our customers for purchase 
we defer the fair value of these revenues and recognize revenue over the life of the warranty 
this impacts all segments of our business except for the other segment where minimal warranty  if any  is offered 
future warranty obligation costs are based upon historic factors such as labor rates  average repair time  travel time  number of service calls per machine and cost of replacement parts 
each segment consummating a sale recognizes the total customer revenue and records the associated warranty liability based upon the pre established warranty percentages for that product class 
total warranty costs were million  million and million  representing  and of total product revenues  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
historically the principal factor used to estimate our warranty costs has been service calls per machine 
significant changes in this factor could result in actual warranty costs differing from accrued estimates 
although no near term changes in our estimated warranty reserves are currently anticipated  in the unlikely event of a significant increase in warranty claims by one or more of our larger customers  costs to fulfill warranty obligations would be higher than provisioned  thereby impacting results 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefits we account for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
our postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and our postemployment plans are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
we have significant pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit costs and credits  which are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability relating to these plans 
these factors include assumptions we make about interest rates  expected investment return on plan assets  rate of increase in health care costs  total and involuntary turnover rates  and rates of future compensation increases 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop our valuations 
we generally review and update these assumptions on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension  postretirement or postemployment benefits expense we have recorded or may record 
postretirement and postemployment expenses impact all of our segments  while pension expense is reported at the corporate level 
the key assumptions used in developing our pension and postretirement plan expense were the discount rate of and expected return on assets assumption of for our us plans  which represents and of pension and postretirement plan obligations  respectively 
holding all other assumptions constant  a change in the discount rate used for the us plans would have increased or decreased pre tax income by approximately million million in pension expense and million in postretirement expense 
likewise  a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption for the us pension plan would have increased or decreased pre tax income by approximately million 
our expected return on plan assets has historically been and will likely continue to be material to net income 
while it is required that we review our actuarial assumptions each year at the measurement date  we generally do not change them between measurement dates 
we use a measurement date of december for all of our plans 
in determining pension and postretirement expense for the us plans  we intend to use a discount rate of and an expected rate of return on assets assumption of 
the most significant assumption used in developing our postemployment plan expense was the assumed rate of involuntary turnover of 
the involuntary turnover rate is based on historical trends and projections of involuntary turnover in the future 
a change in the rate of involuntary turnover would have increased or decreased pre tax expense by approximately million 
the sensitivity of the assumptions described above is specific to each individual plan and not to our pension  postretirement  and postemployment plans in the aggregate 
environmental and legal contingencies each quarter  we review the status of each claim and legal proceeding and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies 
to the extent the amount of a probable loss is estimable only by reference to a range of equally probable outcomes  and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  we accrue for the low end of the range 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and external factors beyond our control  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents except for the sharing agreement with appleton papers inc api described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements note with respect to the fox river matter  when insurance carriers or third parties have agreed to pay any amounts related to costs  and we believe that it is probable that we can collect such amounts  those amounts would be reflected as receivables in our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant legal contingency impacting our company relates to the fox river matter  which is further described in detail in note this matter impacts our company overall and does not affect the financial results of any one of its segments 
as described in note  ncr was identified as a potentially responsible party prp at the fox river site in wisconsin  because of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb discharges from two carbonless paper manufacturing facilities previously owned by ncr located along the fox river 
our reserve for the fox river matter was approximately million as of december  after taking into consideration amounts expected to be recovered under an indemnity agreement discussed in note 
for the year ended december   the company recorded net charges of million to increase the fox river reserve based upon the information discussed in detail in note the increases during the year were partially offset by the incurrence of ongoing fox river related expenses which are charged against the reserve 
the company regularly re evaluates the assumptions used in determining the appropriate reserve for the fox river matter as additional information becomes available and  when warranted  makes appropriate adjustments 
in  the us environmental protection agency usepa and wisconsin department of natural resources wdnr issued their final clean up plans known as a records of decision  or rods for the fox river 
the usepa and wdnr the governments have selected large scale dredging as the remedial approach for most of the fox river and estimate that approximately million cubic yards of sediment will be removed 
combining the cost estimates from both rods  it appears the governments expect the selected remedies for the fox river to cost approximately million not taking into account uncertainties and contingencies that could increase the cost 
notwithstanding the issuance of the rods  the extent of our potential liability is subject to many uncertainties at this time 
to begin with  ncr  in conjunction with the other prps  has developed a substantial body of evidence that may demonstrate that the eventual implementation of alternatives involving river wide restoration remediation  particularly massive dredging  would be inappropriate and unnecessary 
there is ongoing debate within the scientific  regulatory  legal  public policy and legislative communities over how to properly manage large areas of contaminated sediments  and ncr believes there is a high degree of uncertainty about the appropriate scope of alternatives that may ultimately be required by the governments 
further  ncr believes the governments cost estimates omit some categories of cost  use unit costs that are lower than what might be expected  and underestimate the cost of some portions of the selected remedy 
as a result  the total clean up costs could be substantially higher  and the cost estimates are subject to many uncertainties 
now that the final clean up decision has been made for the lower portion of the fox river  the governments are initiating the engineering design of the remedy  a process that could take three to four years 
actual dredging in the lower portion will not begin until the design work is complete 
the governments have indicated they expect the design and dredging work to take at least ten years 
significant changes in the remedial approach could take place over this period of time 
moreover  our eventual liability  which we expect will be paid out over a period of at least ten years  and likely as long as twenty to forty or more years  will depend on a number of factors 
in setting our reserve  we attempt to estimate a range of reasonably possible outcomes for each of these factors  although each range is itself highly uncertain 
we use our best estimate within the range if that is possible 
where there is a range of equally probable outcomes  and there is no amount within that range that appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  we use the low end of the range 
in general  the most significant factors include the total clean up costs for the site we use the low end of the range million which is derived from governments estimates in the rods increased by to account for what we determined were underestimates in the governments figures  the total natural resource damages for the site we use the low end of the range million which is derived from government estimates in a report  the share ncr and api will jointly bear of the total clean up costs and natural resource damages as former and current owners of paper manufacturing facilities along the fox river we use the low end of the range  which is based primarily on an estimate of the joint ncr api percentage of direct discharges of pcbs to the fox river  the share ncr will bear of the joint ncr api payments for clean up costs and natural resource damages we estimate we would pay approximately half of the total costs jointly attributable to ncr api  and 
table of contents our transaction costs to defend ncr in this matter we have estimated the costs we are likely to incur over the next ten years  the time period the governments project it will take to design and implement the remedy for the fox river 
at t corp 
at t and lucent technologies  inc lucent are jointly responsible for indemnifying ncr for a portion of amounts for the fox river incurred by ncr over a certain threshold 
ncr s estimate of what at t and lucent will pay under the indemnity is recorded as a long term receivable of million and is deducted in determining the net amount discussed above 
while it remains difficult to predict  we do not expect there to be any significant near term changes to any of the above described assumptions that are likely to have a material effect on the amount of our accrual 
however  there are other estimates for each of these factors which are significantly higher than the estimates described above 
we believe there is such uncertainty surrounding these estimates that we cannot quantify the high end of the range of such estimates 
in any event  assuming  for example  that the above described assumptions are each doubled except where that would be inconsistent with an existing agreement  and taking into account our payments under the interim settlement with the governments discussed below our payments for the potential liabilities for the fox river matter would be approximately million to be paid out over at least the ten year period starting with the end of the second quarter of  and likely as long as twenty to forty or more years 
at t and lucent are jointly responsible for indemnifying us for a portion of amounts incurred by our company over a certain threshold  and the million estimate assumes they will and have the ability to make such payments 
if we were in fact required to pay an amount such as million for ncr s share of the fox river liabilities  it would have a moderate but manageable impact on our liquidity and capital resources  assuming that such amount was required to be paid over the time frame currently contemplated 
however  if such an amount were required to be paid in a shorter time period  it could have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
as described in note  our short term liability for this matter is limited 
in december  ncr and api entered into an interim settlement with the governments that limits ncr api s joint cash payouts to million per year over a four year period beginning at the time of such interim settlement 
any portion of an annual million installment not paid out in a given year will be rolled over and made available for payment during subsequent years up until december  in exchange for these payments  the governments have agreed not to take any enforcement actions against api or ncr during the term of the settlement 
these payments are being shared by ncr and api under the terms of the confidential settlement agreement discussed above and will be credited against our long term exposure for this matter 
our share of these payments was taken into account in determining our reserve 
investment in marketable securities we typically classify our marketable securities as available for sale and account for them at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported  net of tax  within stockholders equity 
if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security is deemed by us to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment is written down to estimated fair value  and the amount of the write down is included in the determination of income 
the determination of whether a decline in the fair market value is to be other than temporary requires a significant amount of judgment and is based on historical experience and upon information available to us at the time 
however  because future events relating to marketable securities cannot be determined with absolute certainty  our decision to recognize a loss may be premature or we may fail to a make a timely adjustment  impacting future earnings 
currently  we do not anticipate any near term changes in the fair market value of our marketable securities and any changes in the fair market value would be immaterial 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on our expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and our tax methods of accounting 
we also review our liabilities under sfas no 
which requires an accrual for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
these projections and estimates may change in the future as actual results become known 

table of contents if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate 
the impact to our effective tax rate would be an increase of one percentage point for each increase of million to the valuation allowance as of december  we have a valuation allowance of million as of december  related to certain deferred income tax assets  primarily tax loss carryforwards  in jurisdictions where there is uncertainty as to ultimate realization of a benefit from those tax assets 
as of december   the valuation allowance was million 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when required  impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset 
we determine the fair value of these assets based upon estimates of future cash flows  market value of similar assets  if available  or independent appraisals  if required 
in analyzing the fair value and recoverability using future cash flows  we make projections based on a number of assumptions and estimates of growth rates  future economic conditions  assignment of discount rates and estimates of terminal values 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
the measurement of impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
this policy is applied to all of our segments 
long lived assets to be disposed of and or held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we determine the fair value of these assets in the same manner as described for assets held and used 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and sfas in june sfas specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas also requires intangible assets with definite useful lives to continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives and be tested for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
indefinite life intangible assets must be tested annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life 
if the intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life  the asset shall be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas similar to goodwill  the assessment of impairment for intangible assets requires estimates of future cash flows 
to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for our disclosure regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
recently issued accounting pronouncements a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements is described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and we incorporate such discussion in this md a by reference and make it a part hereof 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we use a variety of measures to monitor and manage these risks  including derivative financial instruments 
since a substantial portion of our operations and revenue occur outside the united states  and in currencies other than the us dollar  our results can be significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage our exposures and mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the operations of our foreign subsidiaries  we hedge our main transactional exposures through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
this is primarily done through the hedging of foreign currency denominated inter company inventory purchases by the marketing units and of foreign currency denominated inventory sales by the manufacturing units 
all of these transactions are firmly committed or forecasted 
these foreign exchange contracts are designated as highly effective cash flow hedges 
the gains or losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized in the determination of income when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings 
as we hedge inventory purchases  the ultimate gain or loss from the derivative contract is recorded in cost of revenue when the inventory is sold to an unrelated third party 
we have exposure to approximately functional currencies  in which our primary exposure is from fluctuations in the euro  british pound  and japanese yen 
due to our global operations  weaknesses in some of these currencies are sometimes offset by strengths in others 
the us dollar was approximately percent weaker in compared to based on comparable weighted averages for our functional currencies 
this does not include the effects of our hedging activities and  therefore  does not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our operating results 

table of contents our strategy is to hedge  on behalf of each subsidiary  a portion of our non functional currency denominated cash flows for a period of up to months 
in this way  some of the impact of currency fluctuations on non functional currency denominated transactions and hence on subsidiary operating income as stated in the functional currency is mitigated in the near term 
the amount we hedge and the length of time hedge contracts are entered into may vary significantly 
in the longer term longer than the hedging period of up to months the subsidiaries are still subject to the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  the subsidiary results are still subject to any impact of translating the functional currency results to us dollars 
when hedging certain foreign currency transactions of a long term investment nature net investments in foreign operations  the gains and losses are recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of stockholders equity 
gains and losses on other foreign exchange contracts are recognized in other income or expense as exchange rates change 
for purposes of potential risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts that market rate changes may have on the fair values of our hedge portfolio related to firmly committed or forecasted transactions 
the sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the related gain or loss on the forecasted underlying transaction 
as of december  and  a appreciation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million increase or a million increase in the fair value of the hedge portfolio  respectively 
conversely  a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million decrease or a million decrease in the fair value of the hedge portfolio as of december  and  respectively 
the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities at december   was not material in relation to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
during  we swapped a portion of our senior unsecured notes from the fixed rate to a variable rate 
the swap is described in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we utilize non exchange traded financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts that we purchase exclusively from highly rated financial institutions 
we record these contracts on our balance sheet at fair market value based upon market price quotations from the financial institutions 
we do not enter into non exchange traded contracts that require the use of fair value estimation techniques  but if we did  they could have a material impact on our financial results 
also  we do not enter into hedges for speculative purposes 
additionally  we occasionally utilize put option contracts that are not exchange traded that entitle the holder of each option to sell to us  by physical delivery  shares of common stock at a specified price 
these options are recorded as equity as physical delivery is prescribed  although ncr may elect another means of settlement 
however  amounts relating to the company s repurchase obligations at the balance sheet date are reclassified to temporary equity until such time as the option is settled 
we are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk on accounts receivable and financial instruments such as hedging instruments  short term investments  and cash and cash equivalents 
credit risk includes the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
the maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
exposure to credit risk is managed through credit approvals  credit limits  selecting major international financial institutions as counterparties to hedging transactions and monitoring procedures 
our business often involves large transactions with customers for which we do not require collateral 
if one or more of those customers were to default in its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses 
moreover  the current global economy could have an adverse impact on the ability of our customers to pay their obligations on a timely basis 
however  we believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate 
at december  and  we did not have any major concentration of credit risk related to financial instruments
