item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
year in review and outlook summary fiscal continued to be a challenging year for both the airline industry and the company 
it began with the iraq war and sars  which significantly impacted both passenger demand and industry capacity in the first quarter 
labor negotiations with mesaba s pilots became the focus in the summer and led to a day cooling off period between december and january northwest threatened to exercise its early termination rights in the jet agreement in october and the company agreed to extend the early termination provisions first until december  and then until february  while northwest reviewed the overall economics of the rj fleet 
mesaba also returned six saab a model aircraft to their respective leasing companies 
throughout the year  however  mesaba maintained its focus on operating performance  providing completion factors and on time performance among the best in the industry and increased capacity to billion asm  the highest since fiscal fiscal accomplishments for the company included the following after extensive negotiations and strike planning  mesaba agreed to a new contract with its pilots that extends through january management believes this contract should position mesaba well to compete for growth with northwest and provide mesaba with the ability to manage its costs through the continuing uncertainties in the airline industry 
mesaba adjusted business plans for the temporary grounding of five rj in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and the potential early termination of the jet agreement by northwest 
later in the year  mesaba reached an agreement with northwest to return the five rjs to service by summer and continue rj operations through april mesaba successfully completed two facility moves  moving into a new hangar at the minneapolis st 
paul international airport and a general office building in eagan  mn that includes a new  state of the art operations center 
big sky continued to improve its operations through a process designed to establish near and long term goals and measure performance against them 
these improvements produced full year operational performance better than in the past five years 
big sky continued with cost restructuring measures  including reduction of three aircraft and the initiation of e ticketing 
big sky reached a seven year labor contract with its mechanics that extends through august outlook the economic outlook for the company is dependent on business and consumer behavior  which continues to be affected by lingering threats of terrorist activity post september   continued soft economic recovery and political unrest in the middle east 
these factors are likely to persist throughout fiscal the airline industry s economic crisis is forecasted to continue into fiscal  with analysts predicting losses of to billion 
key risks to the company are discussed more fully in the risk factors relating to the company and the airline industry section of item in this annual report on form k 
given the airline industry s continued economic uncertainty  the company s three main business strategies for fiscal are operating excellence maintain outstanding operating performance at mesaba and create an environment of accountability and performance management at big sky to improve operating results 
improve financial position continue to focus on cost control without sacrificing operating performance 
growth and diversification explore growth with existing subsidiaries and consider acquisitions to diversify from the regional airline industry 
fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  earnings summary the company reported net income of million or per diluted share for fiscal  compared to million or per diluted share in fiscal diluted weighted average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding were million and million in fiscal and on december   the company acquired all the outstanding shares of big sky and accounted for the transaction using the purchase method of accounting 
the company has consolidated big sky s results of operations from the acquisition date to march  for fiscal  big sky generated operating revenues of million and operating expenses of million 
due to the fact that year over year and full year information for big sky is not included  a detailed discussion of big sky s operating results and statistics is not presented 
mesaba operating revenues total operating revenues decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the decrease is attributable to a decrease of approximately in completed saab asm  under the airlink agreement due to the return of six saab a model aircraft  the grounding of five rj aircraft from december to march and the temporary shutdown of service during final pilot negotiations in january that resulted in the cancellation of flights 
mesaba operating expenses total operating expenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the cost per asm decreased to from 
the following table compares components of operating cost per asm for the years ended march wages and benefits aircraft fuel aircraft maintenance aircraft rents landing fees insurance and taxes depreciation and amortization administrative and other total wages and benefits increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of the new alpa contract  which included million in retroactive pay  which was partially offset by productivity improvement in maintenance and customer service 
also contributing to the variance were significant increases in health and dental insurance and workers compensation costs 
aircraft fuel decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is attributable primarily to a decrease of in the number of saab block hours flown  favorable fuel burn rates and fuel credits received in fiscal certain provisions of the airlink agreement with northwest protect mesaba from changes in fuel prices 
mesaba s actual cost of fuel  including taxes and pumping fees  was cents per gallon in both fiscal and northwest is responsible for fuel for mesaba s rj operations 
aircraft maintenance costs  excluding wages and benefits  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal aircraft maintenance costs decreased primarily due to a reduction in flight hours flown in fiscal and a reduction in aircraft damage expenses 
aircraft rents decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is attributable to fewer aircraft in service year over year 
landing fees decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction of saab departures during fiscal northwest is responsible for landing fees for mesaba s rj operations 
insurance and taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in the rates charged for hull and passenger liability insurance and favorable property tax credits 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the lower level of depreciation and amortization resulted from reduced capital spending over the last several years 
the reduction is because less capital expenditure is required to maintain the fleet versus investing in the infrastructure to grow the fleet in previous fiscal years 
administrative and other expenses remained relatively constant  increasing to million in fiscal from million in fiscal consolidated operating income operating income totaled million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the company s operating margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal consolidated nonoperating income nonoperating income net increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal nonoperating income represents a government grant of million and interest income earned on the company s investments

the company has consolidated big sky s results of operations from the acquisition date to march  from the date of acquisition to march   big sky generated operating revenues of million and operating expenses of million 
due to the fact that year over year and full year information for big sky is not included  a detailed discussion of big sky s operating results and statistics is not presented 
the following comparative information includes holdings and mesaba on a combined basis 
operating revenues total operating revenues increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase is attributable to an increase of approximately in completed asm under the airlink agreement and in block hours flown under the jet agreement  the elimination of certain concessions granted to northwest following the terrorist attacks on september  and an increase in ground handling activities resulting from the change in operations with two new terminals in minneapolis st 
paul and detroit 
operating expenses total operating expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the cost per asm increased to from 
the significant change in unit cost year over year was due to the increased wages associated with the change in operations with two new terminals in minneapolis st 
paul and detroit  increased aircraft maintenance costs associated with maintaining an aging fleet  increased aircraft rents associated with a greater number of aircraft on lease and increased insurance costs following the terrorist attacks on september  the following table compares components of operating cost per asm for the years ended march wages and benefits aircraft fuel aircraft maintenance aircraft rents landing fees insurance and taxes depreciation and amortization administrative and other total wages and benefits increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is the result of increased ground handling personnel for the two new terminals in minneapolis st 
paul and detroit and increased health and dental costs 
aircraft fuel decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is attributable to decreased fuel consumption 
certain provisions of the airlink agreement with northwest protect mesaba from changes in fuel prices 
mesaba s actual cost of fuel including taxes and pumping fees was cents per gallon in both fiscal and fiscal northwest is responsible for fuel for mesaba s rj operations 
aircraft maintenance costs  excluding wages and benefits  increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal aircraft maintenance costs increased due to the costs associated with maintaining an aging aircraft fleet and revisions to mesaba s estimate of expected overhaul costs 
aircraft rents increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is attributable to the full year impact of the additional saab aircraft that were delivered between the last quarter of fiscal and the first two quarters of fiscal  netted against the return of eight saab aircraft during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal also contributing to the increase are higher rental rates for the aircraft added in fiscal versus aircraft disposed of in the same period 
landing fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to higher landing fees charged by airports due to new airport facilities and higher costs of airport operation 
northwest is responsible for landing fees for mesaba s rj operations 
insurance and taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to increased rates and surcharges for aircraft hull insurance and passenger liability insurance imposed after the terrorist attacks on september  depreciation and amortization decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the lower level of depreciation and amortization resulted from reduced and delayed capital spending 
administrative and other expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the change is attributable to a full year impact of increased security costs following the terrorist attacks on september   offset by reduced crew costs associated with fewer departures in fiscal consolidated operating income operating income totaled million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the company s operating margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal consolidated nonoperating income nonoperating income net decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal nonoperating income represents the offsetting impact of the recognition of a million write down of an investment in a worldcom bond and interest income earned on the company s remaining investments 
in fiscal  nonoperating income of million was due primarily to the recognition of million in us government grant proceeds 
consolidated provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s blended effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate remained constant due to a similar change in the level of nondeductible expenses being applied over the company s earnings 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments increased to million at march  from million at march  the company s working capital decreased to million with a current ratio of at march  compared to million and at march  investments consist principally of municipal securities and are classified as available for sale as of year end 
available for sale investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operations and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  except for other than temporary impairments  which are reported as a charge to current operations and result in a new cost basis for the investment 
the company classifies investments  with an original maturity of more than days that mature within one year as short term and greater than one year as long term 
approximately of the company s accounts receivable balance as of march  was due from northwest 
loss of mesaba s affiliation with northwest or northwest s failure to make timely payment of amounts owed to mesaba or to otherwise materially perform under the airlink or jet agreement for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial results 
cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at march  from million at march  a summary of cash flow activity is as follows operating activities net cash provided by operations in fiscal was million 
the primary sources of cash were from operations  which generated million of net income  million of non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization and million of changes to current operating items 
investing activities net cash used by investing in fiscal was million 
cash that was generated from operations was the source for investing activities 
the primary uses were net purchases of short and long term investments of million and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
financing activities net cash provided by financing in fiscal was million 
this was primary due to the repayment of noncurrent liabilities of million  which was offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million 
outlook the company has historically relied on cash and cash equivalents  investments and internally generated funds to support its working capital requirements 
absent adverse factors outside the control of the company  management believes current liquidity and funds from operations will be adequate resources for meeting current operations and non aircraft capital needs for fiscal contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements as of march   mesaba s fleet consisted of aircraft covered under operating leases with remaining terms of up to years and aggregate monthly lease payments of approximately million 
mesaba leases its saab aircraft  either directly from aircraft leasing companies  through pinnacle under operating leases with initial terms of up to seven years or through subleases with northwest under operating leases with initial terms of up to years 
mesaba leases its rj aircraft from northwest under operating leases with initial terms of up to years 
mesaba believes that its revenues from the airlink and jet agreements will continue to be sufficient to fund its aircraft lease obligations 
if the airlink agreement terminates  then the saab aircraft leases will simultaneously terminate 
likewise  if the jet agreement terminates  then the rj aircraft leases will simultaneously terminate 
as of march   big sky s fleet consisted of aircraft covered under operating leases with remaining terms of four months to months and aggregate monthly lease payments of approximately million 
big sky leases of its aircraft from leasing companies and one aircraft from a municipality under operating leases with initial terms of up to six years 
five of the leases allow big sky to return the aircraft to the lessor upon the occurrence of certain events and contain purchase options 
funding of the monthly minimum lease payments is dependent on continued passenger boardings and ultimately big sky s operations 
the company s airline fleet operating leases do not contain any guaranteed lease residual provisions for which there would be a potential contingency at the termination of the lease period 
the following table summarizes the company s commitments to make long term debt and lease payments for the years ending march  in thousands thereafter total operating leases aircraft non aircraft long term debt capital lease total amounts represent minimum lease payments with initial or remaining terms of more than one year 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of operating leases 
amounts represent principal payments only

an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has i guarantees  ii a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  iii an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or iv any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company has no arrangements of the types described that may have a material current or future effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company has identified its critical accounting policies to include those discussed in the following paragraphs 
the company also has other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items 
management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  based on information presently available  however  changes in these estimates  judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and accordingly actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
aircraft property and equipment estimated lives are used to record depreciation on aircraft property and equipment 
aircraft utilization  airlink and jet agreement contractual lives  technology and changes in business strategy may affect the economic lives used to record depreciation by mesaba or big sky 
the foregoing may also affect depreciation rates  impairment or both 
management of mesaba and big sky regularly review the estimated useful lives and salvage values for aircraft property and equipment 
excess and obsolete inventories estimated recovery percentages are used to record obsolescence reserves for parts inventories 
aircraft utilization  parts availability and changes in parts cost may affect the valuation of parts inventories and obsolescence reserve levels 
management of mesaba and big sky regularly review recovery percentages  reserve levels and inventory valuations for parts inventories 
aircraft maintenance estimated maintenance costs and anticipated aircraft activity are used to determine maintenance reserves 
changes in maintenance contracts  parts and labor costs and aircraft activity may affect the maintenance reserves 
management of mesaba and big sky regularly review airplane activity  expected aircraft return dates  changes in its maintenance contracts and parts and labor costs for maintenance reserves 
goodwill and other intangible assets the excess of the big sky purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired was allocated to certain identifiable intangible assets  including big sky s pilot labor contract and its air carrier certificate and goodwill 
the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated annually  at a minimum  or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amounts 
the evaluation includes future cash flow projections  strategic modeling and other management assumptions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed its annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets and determined that no impairment charge was necessary 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was  and in fiscal  and the company s effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized  or expected to be recognized  in the company s operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
the company establishes reserves when  despite its belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged and that it may not succeed 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
the effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as related interest 
this rate is then applied to the company s quarterly operating results 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risks are the availability and price of jet fuel and changes in interest rates 
mesaba and big sky have not experienced difficulties with fuel availability 
as a part of the airlink agreement  northwest bears the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations for mesaba s fuel requirements 
as part of the jet agreement  northwest provides all fuel at its expense to support mesaba s rj operations 
big sky is subject to fluctuations in fuel prices  but currently fuel expense is not a material cost in relation to the company s total operating expenses 
the company expects that its results of operations will not be materially affected by fuel price volatility 
the company does not hold long term interest sensitive assets and therefore is not exposed to interest rate fluctuations for its assets 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
