item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
executive overview the year was a year of mixed results 
several of the economic trends that underlie the company s prospects remained very strong including residential construction  sales of existing homes and rising consumer confidence 
in addition  the low interest rate environment led to the highest home ownership rate in history 
although telecom construction appears to have bottomed out during  commercial and industrial construction activity continued to decrease as recessionary conditions continued to affect many businesses which have not begun to add space due to low utilization rates 
raw material costs are another area focused on by management 
the cost of pvc and hdpe resins  the primary raw material of the company s products  have increased strongly through the year up over at their peak  before falling slightly during the fourth quarter of there has been little  if any  additional supply of these materials 
the costs of feedstocks to produce these resins have also remained at historically high price levels  especially the cost of natural gas  ethylene and electricity 
the resin producers have successfully passed on most of these higher costs in the current year as they have been running at capacity utilization of close to 
only limited reductions in resin costs were experienced in the fourth quarter  when seasonal adjustments typically take place 
the company was able to achieve some higher pricing  an average of increase in the pvc pipe business segment  but  due to continued weakness in some of the company s end markets  the material spread  the difference between the price and cost of a pound of resin  narrowed and the business incurred operating losses 
one of the company s key initiatives in was aimed at limiting its exposure to the volatility of pvc resin costs 
the company added east and west coast blend operations  eliminating much of the work in process inventory and simplifying the supply chain 
the goal is to keep no more than one month s supply of pvc products on hand lowering the risk of cost volatility 
the company s performance was also impacted this year by significantly higher employee and retiree benefit costs 
as a result of the significant deterioration in the stock market valuation during  the defined benefit pension plan assets were reduced which caused an increase in the reported pension expense of million  from million in to million in healthcare costs also climbed as expense for current employees was up million compared with and historical retiree medical expenses rose about million 
the company has put cost containment changes into its healthcare plans for employees  however  there are limited options for additional changes to retiree plans 
the primary driver for the retiree medical expense increase is the proportionately higher rates of prescription drug use and their rapidly rising costs 
also  the company is contingently liable for certain post retirement medical and life insurance benefits of ysd industries inc ysd  a business which the company sold in based on the deteriorating financial condition of ysd  the company concluded that it is unlikely that this business will be able to continue funding these benefits 
therefore  the company has recorded a charge for million net of million in income tax in discontinued operations which reflects the actuarial computed liability through february when the company s obligation will end 
compared with results of continuing operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated items from the consolidated statements of operations as percentage of net sales for years ended net sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses operating income interest expense income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax provision income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net sales for were million  or higher than the million net sales reported in each of the business segments increased their net sales primarily through price increases  introduction of product line expansions or the expansion of market share 
much of the company s underlying markets  especially commercial  industrial and telecom construction  trended lower this year compared with operationally  the company continues to focus on a key strategic objective of on time  in full  error free delivery of products and services to our customers 
this objective is tracked daily to limit the amount of backorders and time to ship 
there has been continuous improvement in the company s operational performance allowing it to obtain opportunities for market share expansion  especially with its electrical distributors and retail customers 
gross profit in was million compared with the million gross profit in gross margins were unfavorably impacted by higher raw material costs that were not able to be completely recovered with price increases and higher employee benefit costs as previously discussed 
the manufacturing facilities experienced higher capacity utilization this year going from in to in the increase was primarily in the pvc and hdpe pipe extrusion facilities as the molding facilities have continuously run at consistently higher rates the last several years 
the overall cost of the company s supply chain  including distribution and freight costs  were higher in the current year by only  while the increased shipping activity rose in excess of 
this was caused by the distribution operation successfully focusing on improving bin accuracy  therefore  raising their productivity throughout the year 
meanwhile  freight costs are trending upward slightly due to the rising fuel costs and carrier consolidations 
the company monitors key transportation metrics to attempt to control freight costs while still serving the customers 
operating expenses were lower in by million to million from million in variable selling and marketing costs tracked upward with the increased sales levels adding approximately million in costs in these higher costs were offset primarily by favorable bad debt experience million this year and a significant decline in incentive compensation awards million as operating goals were  for the most part  not met 
as a result  operating income for was million of net sales compared with million of net sales in net interest expense of million in decreased by million compared with the decline was primarily due to lower average interest rates of in compared with in  while the average outstanding debt was million in compared with million in the income tax provision for reflects an effective tax rate of 
the company s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda was million for and million for the components of this calculation are as follows dollars in thousands operating income   depreciation   amortization   ebitda   ebitda is a calculation used by management to measure liquidity 
ebitda is not a recognized term under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
the following is a reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to ebitda dollars in thousands cash provided by operating activities   interest expense   increase decrease in operating assets and liabilities   ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization   business segments carlon net sales in the company s largest business segment increased by million a increase to million in from million in the entire increase came from higher sales of electrical products as the telecom product sales remained relatively flat 
in carlon introduced a key account management program 
its objectives are to focus selling and marketing  along with other support services  and growth opportunities on strategic accounts that have higher long term growth potential 
this effort  along with selective product line expansions  supported the net sales growth in other than residential construction  which continued its double digit growth  the markets serviced by carlon including commercial  industrial and telecom construction continued their contraction in as businesses put off new investments 
gross margins were adversely affected in this business segment as raw material cost increases  primarily pvc and hdpe resins  were not able to be fully passed on as higher selling prices 
this business segment is impacted by capacity utilization primarily in the molding and hdpe extrusion facilities 
the molding facilities continued to experience good utilization  exceeding an average of for the hdpe extrusion facilities  while recording better utilization in  still are using less than of their available capacity 
the company continues to look for alternative markets  such as gas collection pipe  to help improve utilization rates in these plants and is considering additional rationalization of capacity 
the operating income for this business segment fell in to million from million in  a decline of million  or 
actual operating expenses were lower than the prior year as the business segment implemented cost containment programs during the year 
the entire decline in margins came from higher cost of sales as described above 
lamson home products this business segment  which serves primarily the do it yourself home improvement market  was favorably impacted by continued strong existing home sales  low interest rates and rising consumer confidence 
in addition  the various supply chain initiatives undertaken over the last several years  including leveraging the company s enterprise resource planning system  have resulted in fill rates the number of order line items filled with the first shipment that average above for the entire year 
this operational performance  along with continuous innovation on new products and product line expansions  has resulted in this business segment gaining additional market share with various customers 
in particular  lamson home products was named sole source for all of home depot s non metallic electrical box business in mid the rollout of this additional business was substantially complete at the year end 
in summary  for  this business segment increased its net sales to million  a million  or increase  over the million in net sales in lamson home products  like carlon  was unable to pass on the higher raw material costs realized this year 
however  through the evolution of sales mix to higher margin products  the continued favorable utilization of the molding facilities that support this business segment and the spreading of relatively fixed distribution expenses over higher volume  lamson home products was able to maintain gross margins at approximately the same rate as the prior year 
operating expenses for lamson home products rose about over primarily as a result of higher variable selling expenses with the increased net sales levels 
overall  the business segment realized million in operating income in  an increase of million  or over the operating income of million 
pvc pipe the year was another difficult one for the pvc pipe business segment  as the commercial  industrial and telecom construction markets  as previously discussed  continued their downward trend 
the majority of the company s pipe pounds are sold into these markets while the strong residential construction market consumes smaller pipe sizes and thus  a lower percentage of volume 
total pvc resin pounds sold in was down approximately from while pricing was up an average of over the prior year 
overall  the pvc pipe business increased net sales in to million from million  a rise of million  or 
as part of the pvc pipe business  lamson vylon pipe  a unit that markets large diameter sewer pipe  was able to produce additional sales this year by introducing small diameter sizes of sewer pipe 
gross margins in the business segment eroded in as resin costs averaged higher than the prior year while only about a third of this cost increase was able to be passed on to customers 
on a positive note  the pvc pipe extrusion facilities increased their capacity utilization by almost basis points due to the reduction of pvc inventory during operating expenses for the pvc pipe business segment remained fairly consistent with the prior year while the operating loss for totaled million versus a million loss in liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity and capital resources is cash generated from operating activities and availability under its credit facility 
cash provided by operating activities in was million compared with million in and million in cash generated from earnings was down this year by approximately million from cash generated by working capital was lower by approximately million this year 
the higher sales levels did generate higher customer cash receipts as there was only an increase of million in accounts receivable to a balance of million at january  days sales outstanding also improved at year end to days from and days at and year end  respectively 
in the prior year  the company aggressively drove inventories down by approximately million as sales activity declined due to weak market conditions 
inventories in decreased further by approximately million despite the higher sales levels  and inventory turns improved to times from times in both raw material and work in process inventories have declined due to key initiatives of increasing consigned inventory and the improved blend plant logistics 
the company invested more in finished goods inventory to support sales order fill rates for market share gains realized in the second half of in addition  the year end average cost of key raw materials  primarily pvc and hdpe resins  have risen by over compared with year end the company s operating cash flow was lower than anticipated due to a timing difference between fiscal year periods 
due to the year end cut off of january   several cash payments were made at the end of fiscal year  which were not paid in the fiscal year ending december  these include items such as resin vendor and lease payments  which are due at calendar months end 
the year end interest payments of million also effectively lowered other accrued expenses 
during the first quarter of approximately million in bonuses were paid that were earned in while very minimal levels of payments for incentive compensation were made in due to improved pension asset returns in  no additional voluntary contributions were made in compared with the discretionary million voluntary contribution made in the prior year 
cash invested in capital expenditures more than doubled this year to million compared with million in approximately million was spent improving the supply chain by adding blend facilities at two extrusion facilities  which eliminated over million in work in process inventory  reduced interplant freight charges and improved customer service 
the remaining capital expenditures were primarily spent to enhance factory automation  tooling for product line expansions and the replacement and upgrading of various molds and other equipment 
the company continues to have adequate credit capacity  however  availability has declined to around million at the year end in line with the seasonal needs of the business 
the company was able to lower its leverage ratio  which will  in turn  be reflected as a basis point decline in the secured bank facility interest rate beginning in the first quarter of the company continues to operate under a business plan the plan accepted by the new york stock exchange inc nyse in december the company submitted its plan to the nyse in october in order to comply with the listing requirements of the nyse 
this effort followed a formal notice from the nyse that the company was  at the time of the notice  below the nyse s continued listing criteria of a total market capitalization of not less than million over a day trading period and shareholder equity of not less than million 
the company s plan has been reviewed quarterly by the nyse to monitor progress towards achieving the prescribed listing criteria levels 
at the end of  the company s market capitalization was million and its shareholders equity was million 
on january   the nyse received approval from the securities and exchange commission sec to amend its new and continued listing criteria 
while the sec approved a six month pilot program to allow time for comments on the amendments  permanent approval is expected once the comment process is completed 
the transition rules provided for in the pilot program will allow the company to first complete its existing plan period and  secondly  then be evaluated in relation to the new standards 
the amended nyse listing criteria will provide that a listed company  such as the company  will be below continued listing compliance standards if either its average global market capitalization over a trading day period is below million and  at the same time  its shareholder equity is less than million  its average market capitalization is less than million over a trading day period  or the average closing price of a security is less than over a trading day period 
the company is currently in compliance with these enhanced listing requirements of the nyse and while there is no guarantee of prospective market valuations  the company is confident that it will remain so during the remainder of its plan period which expires in april the company s global market capitalization on february  is million 
outlook for housing starts reached levels in of approximately million units  which is the highest activity level in nearly years 
this growth  along with strong existing home sales  was fueled by continued low interest rates 
it is anticipated that interest rates will remain relatively stable at this level until at least mid year when modest increases are expected 
therefore  management believes residential construction  although decreasing from near record levels  will still remain in the to million unit range in in addition  it is estimated that the median age of homes is over years  which is fueling increased rehabilitation and remodeling expenditures 
conversely  commercial  industrial and telecom construction activity is thought to have hit their low points during given the current excess space and infrastructure capacity that remains underutilized  management does not anticipate an increase in commercial and industrial construction until the second half of after the economic recovery is more stable and sustained  particularly in the manufacturing sector 
telecom projects are expected to be about the same as  as companies are still acquiring already existing network assets rather than building new ones and new technology applications  such as fiber to the home  are progressing slowly and awaiting more signs of consumer acceptance and enhanced paybacks 
the one possibility of growth in telecom sales for carlon comes from market share gains with existing customers through its key account management program and the emergence of carlon as one of the stronger national suppliers remaining for the major telecom customers telephone and cable tv companies 
pvc and hdpe resin costs are beginning at higher levels than in early and are expected to increase further through the second quarter  before leveling off  fueled by high natural gas  feedstock costs and industry capacity restraints 
the weaker dollar and increased economic activity globally have caused the export of resin to become more attractive and support continued higher costs domestically 
the company has announced price increases in its carlon business segment and expects the pvc pipe segment to also have higher selling prices in order to recoup these higher costs 
during  the company has implemented cost savings and containment measures that should benefit results 
improvements made in the supply chain  namely the investment in blend facilities at two extrusion facilities  the increased use of automation and improvements made to tooling and molds will allow the company to be more efficient and lower product costs 
structural changes were made to existing medical plans with the goal of limiting this benefit cost growth in finally  management continues to review opportunities for capacity rationalization in its extrusion operations in order to lower its investment and improve profitability 
cash flow from operating activities in is expected to improve from as operating results become more profitable and through the absence of the doubling up of various trade and accrual payments made in capital expenditures should be million to million as the company plans to invest in projects to improve productivity  quality and the rollout of new products 
the company s secured credit agreement is scheduled to expire in august it is management s intent to replace this facility prior to august with other long term debt 
during the financial covenants were adjusted to reflect the current estimated operating levels 
based on the expected results for  management does not anticipate any covenant issues for the remaining term of the agreement 
in summary  we estimate that net sales in will increase to  coming primarily from higher pricing expected in the pvc pipe business segment and the rationalization of market share gains made by lamson home products in the latter part of given consideration of the higher cost of raw materials and offsetting savings from the implementation of operational improvement initiatives  we believe that earnings per diluted share for continuing operations in should increase to over results  excluding the discontinued operations charge  to 
to 
cents per diluted share 
critical accounting estimates inherent in the company s results of operations are certain estimates  assumptions and judgments including reserves against accounts receivable for doubtful collections  inventory costing and valuation allowances and an assumed rate of return on invested pension assets 
the company maintains allowances against accounts receivable and inventory obsolescence and valuation reserves that are reasonable and that are based on the company s historical experience and current expectations for future performance of operations 
accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
a sudden and prolonged deterioration in the economy could adversely affect the company s customers especially related to the telecom or retail market requiring the company to increase these allowances 
inventory valuation a sudden or unexpected decline in pvc resin costs  coupled with a slow down in sales volume  could result in write downs of inventory valuations 
if such adverse conditions would occur  the company cannot readily predict the effect on its financial condition or results of operations as any such effect depends on both future results of operations and the magnitude and timing of the adverse conditions 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans the measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other post retirement benefits is impacted by management s assumptions related to interest rates  return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases and healthcare trend rates 
actual pension plan asset performance will either increase or decrease the unamortized actuarial gains or losses  which affects future pension expense 
likewise  variations between actual and estimated healthcare trend rates will affect retiree medical expense in the future 
see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
for  certain key assumptions have been adjusted  including the lowering of both the assumed return on plan assets from to and the discount rate from to environmental and legal obligations management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for environmental cleanup and litigation 
liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of matters such as changes in laws  regulations and their interpretation  the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination  and improvements in technology 
likewise  actual litigation costs can vary from estimates based on the facts and circumstance and application of laws in individual cases 
deferred tax assets as of january   the company had approximately million of net deferred tax assets including loss carryforwards that expire through and other temporary differences 
the realization of these net assets is based primarily upon estimates of future taxable income 
current expectations of operating results are sufficient to sustain realization of these net assets 
however  should taxable income estimates for the carryforward period be significantly reduced  the full realization of net deferred tax assets may not occur 
goodwill valuation as disclosed in the company s consolidated financial statements  the company has goodwill of million  the majority of which relates to the telecom reporting unit in the carlon business segment 
an annual impairment test of goodwill is performed by an independent third party as of the first day of the fourth quarter or as conditions warrant 
the test as of october  resulted in no additional impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the telecom reporting unit 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
stock option accounting as allowed by sfas no 
and no 
 the company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of the standard and does not recognize expense for stock options granted to employees 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements for the impact on earnings if the company was required to reflect this expense in operating results 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities known as special purpose entities spes 
in the ordinary course of business  the company leases certain real properties and equipment as disclosed in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of january  dollars in thousands payment due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt obligations      capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations other long term liabilities total      forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain expectations that are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those expected as a result of a variety of factors  such as i the volatility of resin pricing  ii the ability of the company to pass through raw material cost increases to its customers  iii maintaining a stable level of housing starts  telecommunications infrastructure spending  consumer confidence and general construction trends  iv the continued availability and reasonable terms of bank financing and v any adverse change in the recovery trend of the country s general economic condition affecting the markets for the company s products 
because forward looking statements are based on a number of beliefs  estimates and assumptions by management that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate  there is no assurance that any forward looking statement will prove to be accurate 
compared with results of continuing operations net sales declined in by million or compared with the greatest reduction was experienced in the carlon business segment  as net sales were million or lower in compared with almost the entire shortfall was due to the significant decline of over in telecommunications infrastructure related sales 
the electrical product sales in this segment declined only nominally in from  as strong residential and utility markets offset declines in commercial and industrial construction 
favorable existing home sales activity  driven by low interest rates  the introduction of innovative new products and the expansion of market share with its largest customers all led to the million increase in net sales in the lamson home products business segment 
this represents a improvement over the million in net sales in overall  net sales for the pvc pipe business segment fell by million or to million in compared with million in pipe volume shipped in was lower than while average pricing for the current year was approximately the same as the prior year 
the volume decline primarily reflects the soft market conditions for both telecommunications and commercial construction projects 
gross margin in was  an increase of over the realized in the largest improvement was generated in the pvc pipe business as selling prices stayed fairly level with the prior year  while operating costs and net material costs per pound declined slightly 
the overall manufacturing utilization rates in were at compared with experienced in and was almost entirely offset by cost savings from the restructuring efforts at the end of and disciplined cost controls employed throughout the year 
finally  the significant increase in lamson home products sales in helped the company to leverage their largely fixed cost base  improving the segment s gross margin 
this helped to offset the lower margins in the carlon business segment  which resulted from the continued downturn in telecom related products 
operating expenses were reduced to million  or of sales  in  a million  or  decrease from the million  or of net sales  incurred in approximately half of the reduction in expenses is a direct result of the elimination of goodwill amortization as required by sfas no 
see note b 
the remainder of the decline is a combination of cost savings from the full year effect of reductions in the salary workforce implemented in the fourth quarter of  lower variable selling expenses from the reduced sales levels and tight control over discretionary spending primarily involving marketing programs and travel related expenditures 
these savings were partially offset by increased employee benefit costs including pensions  medical programs  incentive compensation plans  professional fees and higher bad debt expense driven by telecom market bankruptcy activity 
operating income for was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or  of net sales in this improvement of almost is a result of the operating expense net reduction in the current year as described above 
interest expense has declined by over million in compared with as the company paid down over million in debt during the year  with outstanding debt averaging million in versus million in the company had an average borrowing rate during of compared with in during the second quarter of  the company completed the transitional review for goodwill impairments required under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the review indicated that goodwill recorded in the telecom reporting unit of the carlon business segment was impaired as of the beginning of fiscal accordingly  the company measured and recognized a transitional goodwill impairment loss of million million after tax 
this has been recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations see note b 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and commodity prices for pvc and hdpe resins 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
almost all of the company s long term debt obligations bear interest at a variable rate 
in order to mitigate the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations  in the first quarter of  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of million  million outstanding at january   and effectively fixed the variable rate debt at and plus the company s risk premium of to 
the average rate at january  is 
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flow to be exchanged and does not represent exposure to credit loss 
these risks and others that are detailed in this form k must be considered by any investor or potential investor in the company
