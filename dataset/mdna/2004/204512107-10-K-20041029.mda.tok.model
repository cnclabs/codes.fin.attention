overview we are a full service technology transfer and licensing provider focused on the technology needs of our customers and transforming those requirements into commercially viable solutions 
we develop relationships with universities  companies  inventors and patent or intellectual property holders to obtain the rights or a license to their technologies  and they become our clients  for whom we find markets for the technology 
we also develop relationships with those who have a need or use for technologies  and they become our customers  usually through a license or sublicense 
we identify and commercialize innovative technologies in life  digital  nano  and physical sciences developed by universities  companies and inventors 
our goal is to maximize the value of intellectual assets for the benefit of our clients  customers and shareholders 
we earn revenues primarily from licensing our clients and our intellectual property rights  principally patents and inventions collectively  the technology  to our customers licensees 
our customers pay us royalties based on their usage of the technology  and we share the fees with our clients 
currently  we have a concentration of revenues derived from three technologies 
certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
in addition  we have revised our consolidated statements of operations to a single step presentation for all years presented 
under this presentation  all income is presented in revenues and all expense is presented in expenses and deducted from revenues 
we revised our definition of cash equivalents to include all highly liquid investments  and this definition now includes accounts previously classified as short term investments 
because we have rounded all amounts in this item to the nearest thousand dollars  certain amounts may not total precisely 
in addition  all periods discussed in this item relate to our fiscal year ending july first  second  third and fourth quarters ending october  january  april and july  respectively

our us patent that covers this homocysteine assay  the validity of which has been confirmed by a court decision  expires in july we believe that revenues from this technology will continue to grow  possibly at a substantial rate  but we cannot predict if or when we will succeed in closing additional license agreements and enforcing our patent rights  or how the growth in volume will affect assay pricing 
we have filed suit against abbott laboratories and bayer corporation we settled with bayer for infringement of our homocysteine assay patent and are pursuing other laboratories and diagnostic supply companies performing or manufacturing homocysteine assays to protect our rights to receive royalties on each assay performed 
we cannot estimate the impact of our actions with respect to enforcing our homocysteine assay patent at this time 
we expect ethyol retained royalties to continue at their level for several years 
the decreases in retained royalties from gallium arsenide  electrochromic display and the vitamin b assay were the result of expired or terminated licenses 
approximately of our retained royalties for was from three technologies from homocysteine assays  from ethyol  and from gallium arsenide patents 
we are seeking new technologies to mitigate this concentration of revenues  to replace revenues from expiring licenses and to provide future revenues 
page royalty settlements and awards comprised approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for and  and were derived from the materna tm litigation

settlement with unilens  net for was  relating to our settlement with unilens corp 
usa unilens in october unilens agreed to pay us a gross amount of  in quarterly installments of at least  to settle an old receivable due us that we had written off in prior years 
through june  we recorded  of income  representing our portion of the cash collected from unilens under the settlement 
at july  we reviewed unilens financial condition and determined that the remaining balance of the receivable was collectible 
as a result  we recorded income of  which represented the net present value of our portion of the remaining receivable balance 
we will accrue interest income on the receivable from unilens as we receive installment payments from unilens 
in prior years we had received shares of unilens stock in partial payment against the old receivable 
we sold the remaining shares in the fourth quarter  generating net proceeds of  which we also recorded as income since the shares had no book value 
interest income  net for was  compared to  in in addition to the interest income related to the materna award discussed above  we earned net interest income of  and  respectively  on our invested cash and cash equivalents in and although our average invested balance increased significantly in april with our receipt of the materna litigation award  our weighted average per annum interest rate was for  lower than the rate in page expenses increase increase decrease decrease personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues    general and administrative expenses    patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements    impairment losses on investments    reversal of accounts payable exchanged for contingent note payable   total expenses    personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues decreased due to a combination of several factors only the more significant factors are discussed herein 
our personnel expenses for were  higher than for this increase includes higher bonus expense  a severance payment of  paid to our former chief financial officer  and recruiting expenses for new employees in in we also incurred increased expenses related to entering a patent in the mpeg licensing portfolio 
offsetting these increases  in our impairment charges on intangible assets acquired were  compared to  for  a reduction of  with the lower carrying value for our intangible assets acquired  our amortization expenses for were  lower than for  and we expect our amortization expense to be approximately  in and general and administrative expenses decreased in principally due to a decrease in our legal fees incurred in connection with the securities and exchange commission sec investigation and civil suit  which were  lower for than for  when the sec investigation was much more active 
we also reduced costs for our annual report  financial advisory and audit services 
we expect to incur higher expenses in future years to implement the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements  reflect our level of activity and vary depending on the stage of the litigation 
our overall activity in the current year was less than in the prior year 
both years included enforcement in the labcorp and fujitsu litigations 
in addition to these two cases  we expect to incur enforcement expenses in to enforce our homocysteine assay patents with other infringers 
impairment losses on investments decreased in in we reviewed the fair value of our investment in innovation partners international  inc ipi  a japanese company  and determined that it was impaired 
while we continue to hold of ipi s outstanding voting shares  ipi continues to struggle for revenues and profitability 
therefore we recognized an impairment loss of  and reduced our carrying value for this investment to zero 
in we recorded an impairment charge of  to reduce our carrying value for our investment in ntru cryptosystems  inc ntru to zero 
provision for benefit from income taxes we did not record an income tax provision in since we incurred a substantial net operating loss for income tax purposes 
this was due principally to the unilens receivable that had no basis for book purposes but was fully valued for income tax purposes 
as a result  the settlement with unilens in october generated a significant loss on an income tax basis  compared to income of  on a book basis 
in we did not record any income tax benefit since we incurred a net loss and could not conclude that the utilization of the income tax benefit in the future was more likely than not 
we have substantial federal and state operating and capital loss carryforwards to use against future regular taxable income 
in the fourth quarter of we revised our estimated federal alternative minimum tax liability and reversed the  provision that we had provided in the third quarter of page results of operations vs

in the future  we expect to receive and record our maximum limit of  per calendar year in each fiscal year 
the decrease in gallium arsenide retained royalties was due to expiring licenses and much lower sales of licensed products 
our exclusive licensee terminated its license for the electrochromic display in and  as a result  we recognized  of previously deferred revenue and  of license termination fees in the last vitamin b patent expired in november  causing the decline in these retained royalties

in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded  of impairment charges related to intangible assets  principally due to the uncertainty of future revenues from the ribozyme technology 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded  of impairment charges related to intangible assets 
general and administrative expenses for included increased corporate legal expenses directly related to the sec investigation  financing related expenses  and investor relations 
patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements  decreased substantially in compared to as a result of our july  agreement with the university of illinois  our client  in which the university agreed to take the lead and assume the cost of new lead counsel in the litigation against fujitsu 
the level of patent enforcement expenses varies depending on the stage of the litigation

we also recorded an impairment loss of  to write off all of our investment in digital ink  inc dii in because dii was unable to obtain financing to continue operations 
our recovery of  previously advanced to micro asi  inc partially offset these impairment losses on investments in we had written off all our advances to micro asi in because of micro asi s bankruptcy filing 
reversal of accounts payable exchanged for contingent note payable was the result of an agreement we signed on october   whereby future payments to our former patent litigation counsel in the fujitsu matter became completely contingent on any future receipts from fujitsu 
the contingent promissory note is payable only from future receipts in any settlement or other favorable outcome of the litigation against fujitsu 
accordingly  in the first quarter of we reversed  from accounts payable that had been accrued at july  page provision for benefit from income taxes we did not record an income tax benefit on our net losses in or since we could not conclude that the utilization of any income tax benefit in the future was more likely than not 
financial condition and liquidity our liquidity requirements arise principally from our working capital needs  including funds needed to find and obtain new technologies and to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  if necessary 
we fund our liquidity requirements with a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations  including legal settlements and awards 
in addition  we have the ability to fund our requirements through sales of common stock under an equity financing arrangement see below 
at july   we had no outstanding debt or available credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and highly liquid  interest earning investments with maturities when purchased of three months or less  including overnight bank deposits and money market funds 
we carry cash equivalents at cost  which approximates fair value 
during the year ended july   our financial position improved considerably  principally because we received approximately million from the final resolution of the materna litigation  we collected certain amounts due us from unilens  pursuant to our settlement with them  and we completed an equity financing arrangement all explained below 
we also have taken steps to pursue new revenues  and previously structured certain payment obligations to be contingent solely upon receipt of future revenues 
on april   the us supreme court denied wyeth s defendant petition for a writ of certiorari petition requesting the high court to review an appeal in the materna litigation  upholding the original judgment of the lower court in favor of the plaintiffs 
the petition was wyeth s final avenue of appeal in the case  and the denial finalized this case 
on the same day  a bond previously posted by the defendant was released to all parties  and the judgment and award were satisfied 
upon the final resolution of the case  we received  which was our adjusted portion of the court award 
from our proceeds we paid one of our shareholders  plus a nominal amount for interest  to satisfy a non recourse sale and assignment of a portion of our award to the shareholder for  in cash 
earlier in the fiscal year  we sold another portion of our award on a non recourse basis to an outside party for  in cash 
both sales were made in order to raise cash 
in total for  we recorded revenue and interest income of  relating to this litigation 
in we sold certain assets of one of our subsidiaries to unilens for million  including a million installment receivable 
due to uncertainties related to collection of the installment receivable  we previously wrote off the entire balance of the installment receivable 
in july we resumed collection efforts with respect to the receivable from unilens 
in october we reached an agreement to settle all prior claims and to terminate all prior agreements between us 
unilens agreed to pay us an aggregate of  with  paid to us in october on execution of the agreement and the remaining balance payable in quarterly installments on march  june  september and december at the greater of  or an amount equal to of royalties received by unilens from a certain licensee 
during the year ended july   we collected  which was net of certain related expenses and obligations 
page we previously had received  shares of unilens stock as partial payment against the receivable from unilens 
because of very limited trading in unilens stock and its extremely low price  we did not assign a cost basis to the shares when we received them 
during the three months ended july   we sold our shares and recorded the net proceeds of  as income 
at july   cash and cash equivalents were  compared to  at july  cash provided by operating activities in was  compared to a net use of cash of  in the cash provided in the current year principally was the result of receiving a net total of  from the final resolution of the materna litigation 
cash provided by investing activities was  in  compared to  in the increase was due to collection on the unilens receivable and proceeds from sales of unilens stock 
net cash used in financing activities in was used to pay costs related to our equity financing in excess of the amounts we received from sales of our common stock 
in addition to fluctuations in the amounts of retained royalties revenues reported  changes in royalties receivable and payable reflect our normal cycle of royalty collections and payments 
funding and capital requirements on february   we entered into an agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital to sell up to million of our common stock to fusion capital over a month period the stock sale agreement 
we have the right to determine the timing and the amount of stock sold  if any  to fusion capital 
we also have the right  in our sole discretion  to extend the term of the stock sale agreement by six months 
at our option and at any time until days after the termination of the stock sale agreement  we may elect to enter into a second agreement with fusion capital for the sale of an additional million of common stock on the same terms and conditions as the stock sale agreement 
under the terms of the stock sale agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to fusion capital for its initial commitment the initial shares  and agreed to issue  additional commitment shares to fusion capital on a pro rata basis as we sell the million of stock collectively  the commitment shares 
commencement of sales of common stock under the stock sale agreement was contingent upon certain conditions  principally the securities and exchange commission sec declaring effective our registration statement filed with the sec to register  shares of common stock potentially to be issued under the stock sale agreement 
on may   the sec declared our registration statement effective 
subject to our right to suspend sales of our common stock at any time and to terminate the stock sale agreement at any time  fusion capital is obligated to purchase up to  of our common stock each trading day the daily commitment amount 
the daily commitment amount may increase upon each increase in our stock price above per share up to a maximum of  if our stock price reaches or exceeds per share 
the daily commitment amount also may decrease if our stock price drops below a floor price 
the floor price initially was set at per share and we may increase or decrease it from time to time  except that in no case shall it be less than per share 
the sale price per share will be the lower of the lowest sales price on the sale date or an average of the three lowest closing prices during the consecutive trading days prior to the sale date 
fusion capital may not purchase shares of our common stock under the stock sale agreement if fusion capital would beneficially own in excess of of our common stock outstanding at the time of purchase by fusion capital 
however  fusion capital is obligated to pay the daily commitment amount even though they may not receive additional shares until their beneficial ownership is less than the limitation 
fusion capital is free to sell its purchased shares at any time  and this would allow them to avoid the limitation  however  fusion capital has agreed not to sell the commitment shares until the earlier of october   months from february  or termination of the stock sale agreement 
in accordance with the american stock exchange rules  we cannot issue more than  shares of our common stock including the commitment shares to fusion capital under the stock sale agreement without the prior approval of our shareholders 
until the termination of the stock sale agreement  we have agreed that we will not  without the prior written consent of fusion capital  contract for any equity financing including any debt financing with an equity component  or issue any floating conversion rate or variable priced equity or floating conversion rate or variable priced equity like securities 
page through july   we sold  shares and issued  commitment shares of our common stock to fusion capital for approximately  we plan to use the proceeds for general working capital needs 
in consideration for assisting us in arranging the transaction with fusion capital  we agreed to pay our financial advisor a success fee of  the success fee  which was of the total potential equity financing from fusion capital 
we made an initial payment to our advisor of  with the balance to be paid ratably over months 
through july   we had paid a total of  of the success fee  with the balance recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
in addition  we granted the advisor five year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock approximately of  shares  the estimated maximum number of shares that may be sold to fusion capital  excluding the commitment shares  exercisable immediately  at an exercise price of per share which was of the average closing price of our common stock for the day trading period ended january  that was used to determine the number of commitment shares 
the warrants include piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants  meaning that if we file to register any of our common stock  other than a registration relating to our employee benefit plans or certain other exceptions  the advisor may request that we include their shares in the registration  subject to our limiting the amount of shares to be included upon advice from our managing underwriter 
in addition to the cash success fee  we incurred other cash costs relating to the completion of the stock sale agreement  including professional fees  listing fees and due diligence costs 
we also incurred noncash costs for the unpaid balance of the success fee  the estimated fair value of the initial shares  and the warrants issued to our financial advisor 
we have capitalized all of the cash and noncash costs  aggregating  as deferred financing costs  and will charge them against capital in excess of par value on a pro rata basis as we sell shares to fusion capital  based upon the ratio of the proceeds received compared to our estimate of the total proceeds to be received over the life of the stock sale agreement 
we currently estimate that we will sell million of common stock to fusion capital pursuant to the stock sale agreement and  accordingly  charged  for amortization against capital in excess of par value in fiscal the remaining balance of the deferred charges will be amortized against capital in excess of par value as we sell common stock to fusion capital in the future 
since july  through october   we sold  shares and issued  commitment shares of our common stock to fusion capital for approximately  and amortized approximately  of deferred charges against capital in excess of par value 
the amounts and timing of our future cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the results of our operations and marketing efforts  the results and costs of legal proceedings  and our equity financing 
to sustain profitability  we must license technologies with sufficient current and long term revenue streams  and we must continually add new licenses 
however  obtaining rights to new technologies  granting rights to licensees  enforcing intellectual property rights  and collecting royalty revenues are subject to many factors outside our control or that we cannot currently anticipate 
although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts  we believe that the combination of our cash on hand  the ability to raise funds from sales of our common stock under the stock sale agreement  and revenues from executing our strategic plan will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated operating cash requirements at least through fiscal page commitments and contractual obligations at july   our commitments were payments due by period at july  less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations    our other commitments are either contingent upon a future event or terminable on ninety days notice or less 
contingencies our directors  officers  employees and agents may claim indemnification in certain circumstances 
we are currently exposed to potential indemnification claims in connection with the sec investigation and civil suit  and with complaints filed by certain former employees alleging discriminatory employment practices in violation of section of the corporate and criminal fraud accountability act of see item  legal proceedings 
we seek to limit and reduce our potential financial obligations for indemnification by carrying directors and officers liability insurance subject to deductibles 
we also carry liability insurance  casualty insurance for owned or leased tangible assets  and other insurance as needed to cover us against potential and actual claims and lawsuits that occur in the ordinary course of our business 
currently  we engage two independent consultants who provide us with business development and evaluation services under contracts that are cancelable on up to thirty days written notice 
these contracts include contingencies for potential incentive compensation solely as a percentage of new revenues generated by the consultants efforts 
for the years ended july   and  we neither accrued nor paid incentive compensation under such contracts since none was earned 
in addition  previously we engaged a third party to audit royalties reported by certain of our customers 
pursuant to this agreement  we compensate the third party on a contingency basis solely from any additional royalties resulting from the royalty audit 
many of our agreements provide that we apply initial  upfront fees  license fees and or royalties we receive against amounts that our clients or we have incurred for patent application  prosecution  issuance and maintenance costs 
if we incur such costs  we expense them as we incur them and reduce our expense if we are reimbursed from fees and or royalties we receive 
if the reimbursement belongs to our client  we record no revenue or expense 
as of july   ctt and vector vision  inc vvi have contingent obligations to repay up to  and  respectively  in consideration of grant funding received in and ctt also is obligated to pay of its revenues  if any  from transferring rights to certain inventions supported by the grant funds 
vvi is obligated to pay of its net sales of supported products or of its revenues from licensing supported products  if any 
we recognize these obligations only if we receive revenues related to the grant funds 
page as a result of our financial condition and results at and for the year ended july   the american stock exchange amex notified us that we did not meet their standards for continued listing on the amex  since we had experienced net losses in the prior three years and had less than  shareholders interest at july  our financial position and results at and for the year ended july  comply with amex standards for continued listing  and we will submit our financial statements to the amex listing qualifications department for their review 
we cannot determine when or if the amex will lift their review 
on october   we signed an agreement making any further payments to our former patent litigation counsel in the fujitsu litigation completely contingent on future receipts from fujitsu 
this contingent obligation was reflected in a promissory note payable to our former patent litigation counsel for  plus simple interest at the annual rate of from the agreement date  payable only from future receipts  if any  in a settlement or other favorable outcome of the litigation against fujitsu 
as of july   the aggregate amount that we might pay under this note is approximately million  including interest 
we must settle this contingent obligation before we record any revenue from future proceeds related to this litigation 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on the information available at the time and assumptions we believe are reasonable 
by their nature  estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to change at any time  and may depend on factors we cannot control 
as a result  if future events differ from our estimates  assumptions and judgments  we may need to adjust or revise them 
we believe the following significant estimates  assumptions and judgments we used in preparing our consolidated financial statements are critical to understanding our financial condition and operations 
revenue recognition of unilens settlement at the time of our october settlement with unilens when we agreed to settle all prior claims in exchange for  to be paid over time  we believed that collection of the full amount due us was uncertain  due to unilens financial condition at the time and its prior payment history 
therefore  initially we recorded income from this settlement as we received cash from unilens 
at july   we evaluated unilens financial condition and its history of timely payments under the settlement agreement 
based on unilens overall financial position  its cash on hand  its financial results and positive cash flows  we concluded that the remaining balance of our receivable from unilens was collectible 
as a result  we recorded  in income in the fourth quarter of to recognize the net present value of the remaining receivable 
we used a discount rate to estimate the present value of the payments to be received over time 
we believe that this discount rate was appropriate considering that unilens is paying interest at a rate of approximately on a note due to another party that has a first security interest  while we have a subordinate security interest 
as we receive future payments from unilens  we will record interest income for the estimated amount of interest imputed 
assuming that unilens continues to make timely payments  we estimate our aggregate future interest income to be  spread over and page deferred equity financing costs in connection with our equity financing agreement with fusion capital  we incurred  of deferred equity financing costs  including  representing the value of warrants issued to our financial advisor and  representing the value of shares issued to fusion capital to enter into the financing agreement the commitment shares 
the warrants were valued using a black scholes valuation model 
the model and the assumptions we used are similar to those we use to estimate the value of stock options issued to our directors and employees for disclosure purposes  and we believe that our assumptions were reasonable under the circumstances 
in addition  the amortization of the deferred equity financing costs may vary  since it is based on our estimate of the total proceeds we expect to receive from fusion capital under the agreement 
we will review our estimate of the expected total proceeds and adjust our amortization of deferred financing costs prospectively  if necessary 
if our assumptions used to value the warrants or our estimate of the expected total proceeds had been different  then the impact would have been to increase or decrease our total assets  with a corresponding increase or decrease to shareholders interest 
there would have been no impact on our net income 
at july   we estimated that the total proceeds will be  impairment of long term investments and intangible assets we review intangible assets and investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss measured by the amount the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value and re evaluate the remaining useful life of the asset 
if a quoted market price is available for the asset or a similar asset  we use it in determining fair value 
if not  we determine fair value as the present value of estimated cash flows based on reasonable and supportable assumptions 
we apply our impairment policy to our equity investments in privately held companies 
we consider the financial health of each investee including its cash position  its business outlook including product stage and viability to continue operations  recent funding activities  and business plans including historical and forecast financial information 
our equity investments are not readily transferable and our opportunities to liquidate them are limited and subject to many factors beyond our control  including circumstances internal to the investee and broader economic conditions 
we reviewed ipi s annual report  which indicated that ipi continues to struggle for revenues and profitability 
after considering ipi s financial condition and business outlook  we concluded that our investment was impaired  and reduced our carrying value to zero 
we also apply our impairment policy to all acquired intangible assets 
for each technology  we compare our carrying value with our estimated future retained royalties 
if the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from a technology is less than our carrying value for that technology  we record an impairment charge to reduce our carrying value to the estimated fair value of that technology 
in we revised our estimate of future revenues principally from two automotive technologies 
as a result  we reduced their carrying value to zero and recorded an impairment charge of  in we recorded  of impairment charges related to intangible assets principally due to the uncertainty of future revenues from the ribozyme technology 
page related party transactions our board of directors determined that when a director s services are outside the normal duties of a director  we compensate the director at the rate of  per day  plus expenses which is the same amount we pay a director for attending a one day board meeting 
we classify these amounts as consulting expenses included in personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues 
we incurred charges for consulting services including expenses and use taxes provided by one director of  and  respectively  in and  and provided by two directors of  in in  a former director  george c

risk factors in three of the last five fiscal years  we have experienced significant net losses 
the table below summarizes our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the five years ended july  net income loss      net cash flow from operating activities      investing activities      financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents      we incurred substantial net losses in the three years ending july   principally from expenses related to patent enforcement litigation  which we have since reduced significantly 
fiscal included nonrecurring  noncash income from a reversal of million from accounts payable to our former patent litigation counsel 
through july   we have incurred  cumulatively for legal fees and other costs related to an investigation and subsequent civil suit filed by the sec see item  legal proceedings 
our insurance carrier has notified us that they will cover losses going forward in the sec civil suit  according to the terms of our policy 
we still are involved in on going litigation and enforcement  and the costs may be significant 
during fiscal  we focused our efforts and resources on increasing revenues to replace revenues from expiring licenses  however  our efforts and resources have not yet increased revenues sufficiently 
also  in february  to improve our financial condition we entered into an equity financing arrangement with fusion capital for up to million of cash through sales of our common stock  at our option 
approximately million pursuant to this financing remained available at july  also  we received nonrecurring cash income of million and million  respectively  included in revenue and cash flow from operating activities in and  from the materna litigation 
at july  we had more than million in cash and cash equivalents 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve the level of results or that we will not experience substantial losses in the future 
to achieve profitability  we must successfully license technologies with current and long term revenue streams substantially greater than our operating expenses 
to sustain profitability  we must continually add such licenses 
in addition  we must control our costs  including litigation related costs 
the time required to reach recurring profitability is highly uncertain and we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all 
page in addition  our future royalty revenues  obtaining rights to new technologies  granting licenses  enforcing intellectual property rights  and profits or losses are subject to many factors outside our control  or that we currently cannot anticipate  including technological changes and developments  economic cycles  and the ability of our licensees to commercialize our technologies successfully 
consequently  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to be profitable 
although we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts  we believe that our business plan will sustain us at least through fiscal our former chief executive officer and ctt have been named in a civil suit filed by the sec 
until this matter is resolved  our stock price may be adversely impacted  our operations and expenses may be negatively affected  and our ability to obtain any debt financing may be restricted 
on august   the sec filed a civil suit naming competitive technologies  inc  frank r 
mcpike  jr 
our former chief executive officer  and six individual brokers in the united states district court for the district of connecticut  alleging that from at least july to june  ctt was involved in a scheme to manipulate the price of our stock 
the case relates to our stock repurchase program under which we repurchased shares of our common stock from time to time during the period from october  to march  ctt was named as a defendant in the suit due to the alleged conduct of mr 
mcpike  whose conduct in connection with the stock repurchase program was imputed to ctt as a matter of law 
relating to ctt  the sec in the suit seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting us from further violations of the securities exchange act of and a civil penalty pursuant to section d of the securities exchange act of this section provides for maximum penalties of  for a corporate entity and  per individual 
on september   we responded to this civil suit  and filed a motion to dismiss the suit 
on october   the sec filed a motion opposing our motion to dismiss the suit 
further action in this case is pending 
for further information  see item  legal proceedings 
until this matter is resolved  our stock price may be adversely impacted  our operations and expenses may be negatively affected  and our ability to obtain debt financing may be severely restricted 
our by laws provide that we will indemnify our directors  officers  employees and agents in certain circumstances 
we carry directors and officers liability insurance subject to deductibles to reduce these financial obligations 
our directors  officers  employees and agents may claim indemnification in certain circumstances 
we are currently exposed to potential indemnification claims in connection with the civil suit filed by the sec and with complaints filed by certain former employees alleging discriminatory employment practices in violation of section of the corporate and criminal fraud accountability act of see item  legal proceedings 
we seek to limit and reduce our potential financial obligations for indemnification by carrying directors and officers liability insurance subject to deductibles 
we derived more than of our retained royalties in fiscal from three technologies 
we derived approximately  or  of retained royalties from three technologies  or  from the homocysteine assay   or  from ethyol  and  or  from gallium arsenide patents 
in fiscal  we derived approximately of our retained royalties from the same three technologies 
we expect retained royalties from the homocysteine assay to increase in future years 
our us patent that covers the homocysteine assay expires in july our retained royalties from ethyol are limited to a maximum of  per calendar year  and we reached the maximum in calendar  and we expect ethyol retained royalties to continue at their level for several years 
certain of the gallium arsenide patents are expiring and we expect less retained royalties from gallium arsenide in the future see below 
page such a concentration of revenues makes our operations vulnerable to changes in any one of them  and such changes could have a significant adverse impact on our financial position 
certain of our licensed patents have recently expired or will expire in the near future and we may not be able to replace their royalty revenues 
in fiscal  we derived retained royalties from licenses on thirty patented technologies 
we expect royalties from sixteen of those patented technologies to expire in the next five years 
those patented technologies represented approximately of our retained royalties in fiscal fiscal retained royalty revenues of approximately  or   or  and  or  respectively  were from patents expiring in fiscal  and the loss of these royalties may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to replace them with revenue from other licenses or other sources 
since it often takes two or more years for a technology to produce significant revenues  we must continuously seek new sources of future revenues 
we are currently involved in lawsuits that have historically involved significant legal expenses 
if the courts in these suits decide against us  this could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

sales of our common stock to fusion capital will cause dilution to current stockholders and fusion capital s resale of those shares of common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in february we entered into an agreement with fusion capital to sell up to million of our common stock to fusion capital over a twenty month period  subject to certain limitations and extensions 
the purchase price for the common stock to be issued to fusion capital pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement fluctuates based on the price of our common stock 
the purchase price per share is equal to the lesser of i the lowest sale price of our common stock on the purchase date or ii the average of the three lowest closing sale prices of our common stock during the twelve consecutive trading days prior to the date of a purchase by fusion capital 
pursuant to a registration statement filed with the sec  all shares sold to fusion capital are freely tradeable 
fusion capital may sell none  some or all of the shares of common stock purchased from us at any time 
we expect that fusion capital will resell any shares that they purchase over a period of up to twenty months from the date of the agreement  subject to a six month extension or earlier termination at our discretion 
depending upon market liquidity at the time  a sale of shares by fusion capital at any given time could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the anticipation of such sales  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and at a price at which we might otherwise wish to effect sales 
there are  shares of our common stock registered for sale by fusion capital excluding  commitment shares that have been issued fusion capital and the additional commitment shares that are issuable to fusion capital under the agreement 
through july   we sold  shares to fusion capital 
we have the right but not the obligation to sell additional shares to fusion capital under the common stock purchase agreement 
the remaining  of these registered shares equaled of our outstanding shares of common stock at july  in addition to the  shares that were issued to fusion capital as an initial commitment fee  we may issue an additional  shares to fusion capital as we sell shares to fusion capital 
page the sale of shares to fusion capital may result in significant dilution to the ownership interests of other holders of our common stock 
the amount of dilution would be higher if the per share market price of our common stock is lower at the time we sell shares to fusion capital  since a lower market price would cause more shares of our common stock to be issued to fusion capital for the same proceeds 
subsequent sales of these shares in the open market by fusion capital may also have the effect of lowering our stock price  thereby increasing the number of shares issuable to them under the common stock purchase agreement and consequently further diluting our outstanding shares 
although we have the right to reduce or suspend sales to fusion capital at any time  our financial condition at the time may require us to waive our right to suspend purchases even if there is a decline in the market price 
furthermore  the dilution caused by the issuance of shares to fusion capital may cause other shareholders to elect to sell their shares of our common stock  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease 
in addition  prospective investors anticipating the downward pressure on the price of our common stock due to the shares available for sale by fusion capital could refrain from purchases or cause sales or short sales in anticipation of a decline of the market price  which may itself cause the price of our stock to decline 
we are under review by the amex for delisting our common stock 
as a result of our financial condition and results at and for the year ended july   the amex notified us that we did not meet their standards for continued listing on the amex  since we had experienced net losses in the prior three years and had less than  in shareholders interest at july  our financial condition and results of operations at and for the year ended july  comply with the amex standards for continued listing  and we will submit our financial statements to the amex listing qualifications department for their review 
we cannot determine when or if the amex will lift their review 
our revenue growth depends on our ability to understand the technology requirements of our customers in the context of their markets 
if we fail to understand their technology needs or markets  we limit our ability to meet those needs and to generate revenues 
we believe that by focusing on the technology needs of our customers  we are better positioned to generate revenues by providing them technology solutions 
in this way  the market demands of our customers drive our revenues 
the better we understand their markets and requirements  the better we are able to identify and obtain effective technology solutions for our customers 
currently  we rely on our professional staff and contract business development consultants to understand our customers technical  commercial  and market requirements and constraints and to identify and obtain effective technology solutions for them 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
our success depends on the knowledge  efforts and abilities of a small number of key personnel 
john b 
nano is our president and chief executive officer  donald j 
freed is our executive vice president and chief technology officer  michael d 
davidson is our vice president and chief financial officer  and paul a 
levitsky is our vice president and general counsel 
we rely on our professional staff and contract business development consultants to identify intellectual property opportunities and technology solutions  and to negotiate and close license agreements 
competition for personnel with the necessary breadth and depth of experience is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
if we were unable to hire and retain highly qualified professionals and consultants  our revenues  prospects  financial condition and future activities could be materially adversely affected 
page we depend on our relationships with inventors to gain access to new technologies and inventions 
if we fail to maintain existing relationships or to develop new relationships  we may reduce the number of technologies and inventions available to generate revenues 
in addition  technology can change rapidly and industry standards are continually evolving 
this often makes products obsolete  or results in short product lifecycles 
our profitability also depends on our licensees ability to adapt to such changes 
we do not invent new technologies or products ourselves 
we depend on relationships with universities  corporations  governmental agencies  research institutions  inventors  and others to provide us with technology based opportunities that we can develop into profitable royalty bearing licenses 
our failure to maintain these relationships or to develop new relationships could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to forge new relationships or to maintain our current relationships  we may be unable to identify new technology based opportunities and royalty bearing licenses 
we also are dependent on our clients abilities to introduce new products and adapt to changes in technology and economic needs 
further  we cannot be certain that our current or any new relationships will provide the volume or quality of available new technologies necessary to sustain our business 
in some cases  universities and other sources of new technologies may compete against us as they seek to develop and commercialize these technologies themselves  or through entities that they develop  finance and or control 
in other cases  universities receive financing for basic research from companies in exchange for the exclusive right to commercialize any resulting inventions 
these and other strategies may reduce the number of technology sources potential clients to whom we can market our services 
if we are unable to secure new sources of technology  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we receive most of our revenues from customers over whom we have no control 
we rely on royalties received from our customers for revenues 
the royalties we receive from our customers depend on their efforts and expenditures and we have no control over their efforts or expenditures 
additionally  our customers development of new products involves great risk since many new technologies do not become commercially profitable products despite extensive development efforts 
our license agreements do not require customers to advise us of problems they may encounter in attempting to develop commercial products and they usually treat such information as confidential 
you should expect our customers to encounter problems frequently 
our customers failure to resolve such problems may result in a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our customers  and therefore we  depend on receiving government approvals to exploit certain licensed products commercially 
commercial exploitation of some licensed patents may require the approval of governmental regulatory agencies  especially in the life sciences area  and there is no assurance that those agencies will grant such approvals 
in the united states  the principal governmental agency involved is the us food and drug administration fda 
the fda s approval process is rigorous  time consuming and costly 
unless and until a licensee obtains approval for a product requiring such approval  the licensee may not sell the product in the usa  and therefore we will not receive royalty income based on usa sales of the product 
page if our clients and we are unable to protect the intellectual property underlying our licenses  or to enforce our patents adequately  we may be unable to exploit such licensed patents or technologies successfully 
our success in earning revenues from licenses is subject to the risk that issued patents may be declared invalid  that patents may not issue on patent applications  or that competitors may circumvent or infringe our licensed patents and thereby render our licensed patents not commercially viable 
in addition  when all patents underlying a license expire  our royalties from that license cease  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace those royalties with royalty revenues from new or other licenses 
patent litigation has increased  it can be expensive and may delay or prevent our customers products from entering the market 
our clients and or we may pursue patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings against sellers of products that we believe infringe our patent rights 
holders of conflicting patents or sellers of competing products also may challenge our patents in patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings 
for a description of proceedings in which we are currently involved  see item  legal proceedings 
we cannot assure you that our clients and or we will be successful in any such litigation or proceeding  and the results and costs of such litigation or proceeding may materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
developing new products  creating effective commercialization strategies for technologies  and enhancing those products and strategies are subject to inherent risks 
these risks include unanticipated delays  unrecoverable expenses  technical problems or difficulties  and the possibility that development funds will be insufficient 
the occurrence of any one or more of these risks could make us abandon or substantially change our technology commercialization strategy 
our success depends on  among other factors  our clients developing new or improved technologies  our customers products meeting targeted cost and performance objectives for large scale production  and our customers ability to adapt technologies to satisfy industry standards  satisfy consumer expectations and needs  and bring their products to market before the market is saturated 
they may encounter unanticipated technical or other problems that result in increased costs or substantial delays in introducing and marketing new products 
current and future products may not be reliable or durable under actual operating conditions or otherwise commercially viable and competitive 
new products may not satisfy price or other performance objectives when introduced in the marketplace 
any of these events would adversely affect our realization of royalties from such new products 
strong competition within our industry may reduce our client base 
we compete with universities  law firms  venture capital firms and other technology commercialization firms for technology licensing opportunities 
many organizations offer some aspect of technology transfer services  and some are well established and have more financial and human resources than we do 
this market is highly fragmented and participants frequently focus on a specific technology area 
page we have not paid dividends and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since  and we do not expect our board of directors to declare or pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the decision to pay dividends is solely at the discretion of our board of directors based upon factors that they deem relevant 
being a public company increases our administrative costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the sec and new listing requirements subsequently adopted by amex in response to sarbanes oxley  have required changes in corporate governance practices  internal control policies and audit committee practices of public companies 
these new rules  regulations  and requirements may significantly increase our legal  financial  compliance and administrative costs  and have made certain other activities more time consuming and costly 
these new rules and regulations also may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future  and could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee
