item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview igate corporation  formerly named igate capital corporation  through its operating subsidiaries  is a worldwide provider of it and offshore outsourcing services to large and medium sized organizations 
from inception and through february  we conducted the majority of our business under the name of mastech corporation through our wholly owned subsidiary mastech systems corporation  a pennsylvania corporation that was formed in july in march  we transferred substantially all of the assets of mastech systems corporation to subsidiary operating companies 
this reorganization was done to enable us to identify and penetrate emerging it markets quickly and effectively 
in addition  this strategy enabled us to expand our existing portfolio of services as well as to create new service offerings 
we also acquired majority interests or made strategic investments in a number of companies in the internal related services market sector 
our operating subsidiaries provide clients with a source for a broad range of it applications solutions and offshore outsourcing services including client server design and development  conversion migration services  erp package implementation and integration services  software development and applications maintenance outsourcing 
critical accounting policies the following explains our most significant accounting policies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements set forth on pages to of the form k for a complete description of our significant accounting policies 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
all of the estimates that we make in preparing our financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which could impact our earnings 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on time and materials contracts as the services are performed 
time and materials contracts typically bill at an agreed upon hourly rate 
revenue is earned when our consultants are working on projects 
revenue recognition is negatively impacted by holidays and consultant vacation and sick days 
we also have fixed price arrangements with certain customers 
a price for an entire project is agreed upon before the project starts for a predetermined fee 
we recognize revenues on fixed price contracts using the proportional performance method 
we prepare a budget for each fixed price project  and based upon the budget that we prepare  we estimate what our costs should be 
we determine performance by comparing the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
we recognize revenue based upon costs incurred by our consultants during the period 
if our estimates indicate a loss on a particular fixed price contract  we record a provision for the estimated loss without regard to the stage of completion 
changes in job performance  conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the changes are identified 
contracts with deliverables or project milestones recognize revenue as the deliverables or project milestones are achieved 
contracts with deliverables or project milestones can provide for certain penalties if the deliverables or project milestones are not met within contract timelines 
certain maintenance contracts with no stated deliverables  with a designated workforce assigned  recognize revenues on a straight line basis over the life of the contract  which are typically one year in duration 
revenue on these contracts is ratable and predetermined based upon the negotiated contract 

table of contents accounts receivable we extend credit to clients based upon management s assessment of their creditworthiness 
substantially all of our revenues and the resulting accounts receivable are from fortune companies  major systems integrators and us governmental agencies 
unbilled receivables represent amounts recognized as revenues for the periods presented based on services performed in accordance with the terms of client contracts that will be invoiced in subsequent periods 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we review accounts receivable periodically to determine the probability of loss 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined using the combination of the specific identification method for balances deemed uncollectible  as well as judgments made by management based upon historical and expected charge off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be necessary  which may impact earnings 
investments investments in money market funds are stated at cost  which approximates fair value 
investments in marketable equity securities are accounted for in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
we have determined that certain of our investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value  utilizing the investments closing price at each reporting period 
these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with the unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  reported as a component of comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity and comprehensive loss 
the unrealized gain or loss is the difference between our original cost for an investment and the investment s fair value at each reporting period 
realized gains or losses on securities sold are calculated using the specific identification method 
if management determines that an investment in available for sale securities has sustained an other than temporary decline in its value  the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings 
such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of the respective investment 
factors that are considered by us in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis  the financial condition of the investee  and the intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
in evaluating these factors  management presumes a decline in value to be other than temporary if the market price of the security is or more below the investment s cost basis for a period of six months or more the criteria 
however  the presumption of an other than temporary decline in these instances may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature eg  strong operating performance of investee  historical volatility of investee  etc additionally  there may be instances where impairment losses are recognized even if the criteria is not satisfied eg  plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below our cost basis 
during  we incurred impairment losses deemed to be other than temporary 
these impairments are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we account for investments in businesses in which we own between and of equity or otherwise acquire management influence using the equity method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb 
investments in which we acquire less than a interest  or in which we do not acquire management influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting or  if publicly traded  as available for sale securities 
for investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting  management evaluates information eg  budgets  business 
table of contents plans  financial statements  etc 
in addition to quoted market price  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of an investment 
this list is not all inclusive and management weighs all quantitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
estimated fair values of reporting units underlying the segments were estimated using either a discounted cash flow methodology  recent comparable transactions or a combination thereof 
for further discussions  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation at december   we had three stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas gives companies the option to adopt the fair value method for expense recognition of employee stock options or to continue to account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method  as outlined under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we have elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options and disclose the pro forma effect as if the fair value method had been applied in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table illustrates the effect on net loss per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to stock based employee compensation year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net loss  as reported add deferred compensation expense reported in earnings less total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards and deferred compensation expense pro forma net loss earnings per share basic and diluted as reported pro forma compared to as we discussed earlier  we began to manage our business with an increased focus on our offshore delivery model 
as a result  we recast our operating segments effective january  our recast segments are igate solutions  igate professional services and igate corporate 
further  we now classify costs for consultants not being utilized ie bench costs as cost of revenues 
in prior years  these costs were classified as selling general and administrative s  g a costs 
all prior reporting periods have been reclassified to reflect the changes to our segment reporting and our classification of bench costs

the company evaluates segments based on income loss from operations 
since certain administrative and other operating expenses or income sources have not been allocated to the operating business segments  this basis is not necessarily a measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and it may not be comparable to other companies 
igate solutions revenues for our igate solutions segment for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  billable expenses for this segment approximated and as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   the acquisition of aquaregia  quintant  ideaspace and certain businesses of it t by igs contributed million of revenue to 
table of contents the igate solutions segment 
without these acquisitions  revenues for the igate solutions segment would have been slightly lower from the prior fiscal year  which is a result of not being able to grow our non ge revenues and due to the reorganization of our sales and marketing team 
sales cycles in the offshore outsourcing solutions business may extend to twelve months from the initial sales meeting before a services contract is finalized and a sale is made 
because of this  we cannot accurately forecast what impact our revised marketing approach will have on revenues in the upcoming year 
the gross margins for igate solutions were for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  our acquisitions had a favorable impact on igate solutions gross margins for the year ended december  we cannot determine what impact igate solutions acquisitions will have on gross margins in future periods 
the contributing factors that led to the decline in gross margins were a combination of pricing pressures from customers  higher utilization of subcontracted labor versus salaried consultants  increases in wage and bench costs  project cost overruns and the unfavorable impact of blended rate contracts  which contributed approximately of igate solutions revenues 
billing rates for blended rate contracts are determined based upon the anticipated utilization of onsite near shore services services provided primarily in north america and offshore services services provided primarily in india for the particular project 
once established  these rates are fixed for purposes of these contracts 
s  g a expenses include all costs that are not directly associated with our igate solutions segments revenue generating consultants 
s  g a expenses included non consultant salaries and employee benefits  recruiting and training costs  rent  depreciation and amortization  communications  facilities costs  restructuring costs and goodwill impairment

igate professional services ips revenues for our ips segment for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million or as compared to million for the year ended december  billable expenses for this segment approximated and as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
factors contributing to the decrease in revenues for ips were attributable to continued weakness in it spending specifically in the uk  decreases in consultant utilization and declines in overall billable consultant headcount 
because of competitive pricing pressures  billing rates for consultants for comparable years have had a negative impact on revenues 
we expect pricing pressures and related issues to continue to impact our revenues in 
table of contents the gross margin for our ips segment  including billable expenses  was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin in this segment was attributable to a combination of pricing pressures  increases in employee related costs and benefits  as well as increased usage of subcontractor labor 
during the year  we have also expanded an existing relationship as a preferred vendor in canada  in which we act as a vendor management provider 
our margins on these engagements are minimal  and due to this  our overall ips gross margins are impacted 
we cannot determine what impact these factors will have on gross margins 
s  g a costs for the ips segment for the year ended december  were million or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues for the year ended december  factors contributing to the decline in s  g a costs were attributable to better management of employee headcount and other operating costs
