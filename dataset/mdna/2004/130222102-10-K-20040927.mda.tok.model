item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s results include the operations of amplicon  calfirst leasing  and calfirst bank 
the company s direct finance income includes interest income earned on the company s investment in lease receivables and residuals 
other income primarily includes gains realized on the sale of leased property  income from sales type and operating leases and gains realized on the sale of leases  and other fee income 
income from sales type leases relates to the re lease of off lease property lease extensions and new lease transactions that qualify as sales type leases  generally where the fair value of the property subject to the lease differs from the company s carrying cost 
income from operating leases generally involves the re lease of off lease property that is booked as an operating lease rather than as a sales type lease 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors  including the volume of new lease originations  the volume and profitability of leased property being re marketed through re lease or sale  variations in the mix of lease originations  the size and credit quality of the lease portfolio  interest rates and economic conditions in general 
the company has very little interest bearing liabilities  and therefore  reductions in interest rates in general can reduce the yield earned on the investment in lease receivables and on the investment in securities and other interest earning assets with little offsetting benefit from lower interest expense 
the company conducts its business in a manner designed to mitigate risks 
however  the assumption of risk is a key source of earnings in the leasing and banking industries and the company is subject to risks through its investment in lease receivables held in its own portfolio  lease transactions in process  and residual investments 
the company takes steps to manage risks through the implementation of strict credit management processes and on going risk management review procedures 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates that impact the stated amount of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a reporting period 
these accounting estimates are based on management s judgment and are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from current judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
the following is a description of the most critical accounting policies management applies  all of which require the use of accounting estimates and management s judgment  based on the relevant information available at the end of each period

the following is a description of the most critical accounting policies management applies  all of which require the use of accounting estimates and management s judgment  based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
residual values for capital leases that qualify as direct financing leases  the aggregate lease payments receivable and estimated residual value  if any  are recorded on the balance sheet  net of unearned income and allowances  as net investment in capital leases 
of the volume of capital leases booked during the fiscal years ended june   and  approximately  and  respectively  were structured as true leases  where the company owns the leased asset at the end of the term and therefore  the company recorded a residual value 
the residual value is an estimate for accounting purposes of the fair value of the leased property at lease termination and is determined at the inception of the lease based on the property leased and the terms and conditions of the underlying lease contract 
the realizability of any estimated residual value depends on future collateral values  contractual options available to the lessee  the credit of the lessee  market conditions and other subjective and qualitative factors 
the estimated residual values established at lease inception are periodically reviewed to determine if values are realizable and any identified losses are recognized at such time 
allowance for lease losses the allowance for lease losses provides coverage for probable and estimatable losses in the company s lease portfolios 
the allowance recorded is based on a quarterly review of all leases outstanding and transactions in process 
the determination of the appropriate amount of any provision is based on management s judgment at that time and takes into consideration all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect the lease portfolio  including levels of non performing leases  lessees financial condition  leased property values as well as general economic conditions and credit quality indicators 
the company s allowance includes an estimate of reserves needed to cover specifically identified lease losses and certain unidentified but inherent risks in the portfolio 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the time income or expense items are recognized for financial statement purposes and for tax reporting 
such amounts are calculated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the determination of current and deferred income taxes is based on complex analyses of many factors including interpretation of federal and state income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities temporary differences  estimates of amounts due or owed such as the timing of reversals of temporary differences and current financial accounting standards 
actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities 
the company s estimates are reviewed continuously to ensure reasonableness 
however  the amounts the company may ultimately realize could differ from such estimated amounts 
overview of results and trends the following discussion is provided in addition to the required analysis of earnings in order to discuss trends in our business 
we believe this analysis provides additional meaningful information on a comparative basis 
the results for fiscal reflect primarily the negative impact of lower yields on earning assets  which was not offset by a sufficient increase in volume 
the decrease in part relates to the lower interest rate environment that has prevailed for the last two years  and the run off of higher yielding leases booked during prior periods 
the early termination of certain leases also decreased direct finance income 
in addition to the lower interest rate environment  increased competition in certain markets reduced the spreads earned on certain capital leases  when compared to yields obtained in fiscal and before 
as a higher percentage of the company s investment in capital leases relates to lessees with higher credit ratings  the company generally will not earn as high yields 
offsetting this reduction in direct finance income  the company incurred significantly lower credit losses over the past year  which has allowed for a significantly lo wer provision for lease losses 
the provision for lease losses decreased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal and million in the year end june  the decline in provision relates in part to reserves established in for problem credits which were more favorably resolved than expected  but also is believed to relate to improved credit quality a second factor that has impacted the company s results over the past few years is the lower volume of leases reaching the end of term  and on which the company recognizes income from the re lease or sale of property subject to such leases 
the investment in lease residuals realized declined from million in the year ended june  to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company s objective over the past three years has been to increase its investment in capital leases 
significant investments have been made in the development of the lease origination organizations of the bank and calfirst leasing 
total sales  general and administrative expenses sg a increased by  or million  between fiscal and fiscal given the nature of the company s leasing activities  we believe such investment in the organization precedes the resulting growth in revenues by twelve to twenty four months 
while the volume of new leases booked during the fiscal did not increase significantly  the volume of lease proposals obtained and approved originations during fiscal was up about when compared to the comparable period of the prior year 
consolidated statement of earnings analysis summary for fiscal year ended june   net earnings decreased to million  compared to million for fiscal diluted earnings per share decreased to for fiscal year ended june   compared to per share for fiscal the volume of new lease transactions booked during the year ended june  was approximately million  compared to million in fiscal of the new leases booked during fiscal  approximately were retained in the company s own portfolios  compared to in the prior year 
the net investment in capital leases increased from million at june  to million at june  an increase in income from end of term transactions and the benefit from a reduction in the provision for lease losses were offset by a decrease in direct finance income  lower interest rates earned on a continued high level of liquid investments and higher expense levels 
net direct finance and interest income net direct finance and interest income is the difference between interest earned on the investment in capital leases  securities and other interest earning investments and interest paid on deposits or other borrowings 
net direct finance and interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and liabilities  the movement of interest rates  and funding and pricing strategies 
net direct finance and interest income was million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to a decrease of  in direct finance income  a decline of  in interest income on investments and a  increase in interest expense on deposits 
the decrease in direct finance income reflects an increase in the average investment in capital leases directly held by the company  offset by a decrease in yields on such investment 
the decrease in interest income on investments resulted from the decline in interest rates earned  as the level of average balances of cash and cash equivalents increased slightly 
the increase in net direct finance income in fiscal was due to an increase of million in direct finance income  offset by a decline of  in interest income on investments and a  increase in interest expense on deposits 
the increase in direct finance income reflected an increase in the average investment in capital leases directly held by the company  together with a slight increase in yields on such investment 
the decrease in interest income on investments resulted from the decline in interest rates earned  as the level of average balances of cash and cash equivalents increased slightly

average balance is based on month end balances  includes non accrual leases  and is presented net of unearned income 
provision for lease losses the company s provision for lease losses in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal and million in the decline in the provision in fiscal and largely relates to the fact that the overall level of reserves required against problem leases remained relatively unchanged during those fiscal periods 
this stability largely relates to the continued paydown on existing problem leases  along with no significant new problem leases being identified 
in fiscal  the million provision was due in large part to the deterioration in the underlying credit of two large lease transactions  which subsequently performed better than expected and contributed to the lower reserve requirements required in later periods 
other income other income is a significant source of income for the company  accounting for of the company s gross profit during the year ended june   during fiscal and during total other income for the year ended june  increased by million  or  to million  compared to million in and million in the increase in other income during fiscal is due to an increase of million  or  in gain on sale of leases and leased property  as the volume of lease property sold on leases coming to end of term increased during the period  which amount was offset in part by a  decrease in operating and sales type lease income as the volume of leases renewed declined during the year 
during year ended june   other income decreased by million  or  to million  compared to million in the decrease in other income during fiscal is primarily due to a decrease of million  or  in gain on sale of leases and leased property and a million  or  decrease in operating and sales type lease income 
both decreases were due to a lower volume of leases reaching their end of term during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
selling  general  and administrative expenses the company s selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  this compared to sg a expenses in fiscal of million  which had increased by million  or  from million in fiscal the increase in sg a expenses during fiscal is primarily the result of the development of the organization and expanded marketing programs 
the increase in sg a expenses during fiscal was the result of the expansion of the sales organization  which almost doubled its headcount over fiscal year income taxes income taxes were accrued at a tax rate of for each of the fiscal years ended june   and  representing the company s estimated annual tax rates for each respective year 
financial condition analysis lease portfolio analysis over the past three fiscal years  the company has funded a significantly greater percentage of new lease transactions internally  while only a small portion of leases were assigned to financial institutions 
during the fiscal year ended june   approximately of the total dollar amount of new leases booked by the company were held in its own portfolio  compared to during fiscal and during during the fiscal year ended june   the company s net investment in capital leases increased by million 
this increase includes a million increase in the company s investment in lease receivables  and a million reduction in the investment in estimated residual values 
the increase in the investment in capital leases is primarily due to the higher volume of new lease transactions booked and retained by the company 
the company often makes payments to purchase leased property prior to the commencement of the lease 
the disbursements for these lease transactions in process are generally made to facilitate the lessees property implementation schedule 
the lessee is contractually obligated by the lease to make rental payments directly to the company during the period that the transaction is in process  and the lessee is generally obligated to reimburse the company for all disbursements under certain circumstances 
at june   the company s investment in property acquired for transactions in process was million  an increase of million from million at june   and million at june  the company s risk assets are comprised almost exclusively of leases for capital assets to businesses and other commercial or non profit organizations 
all leases are secured by the underlying property being leased 
the company s strategy is to develop lease portfolios with risk reward profiles that meet its objectives 
through the use of non recourse financing  the company avoids risks that do not meet these requirements 
the strategy also emphasizes diversification on both a geographic and customer level  and spreading the company s risk across a breadth of leases while minimizing the risk to any one area 
at june   no lessee accounted for more than of the company s net investment in capital leases  and two lessees combined represented approximately of the company s net investment in capital leases 
the investment in capital leases is diversified by geographic regions  with the company s portfolio spread across all fifty states 
at june   california and new york were the only states that represented more than of the company s net investment in capital leases 
the company has no exposure to foreign lessees 
the company s leases are with lessees in a wide spectrum of industries  however  at june  approximately of the company s net investment in capital leases was with public and private colleges  universities  elementary and secondary schools located throughout the united states 
the educational portfolio includes over leases with over different lessees  and none of these leases are included among the company s non performing leases 
one university represented approximately of the company s net investment in capital leases 
the company believes the exposure to this sector is warranted based on the historically good credit profile of this group 
the company monitors the performance of all leases held in its own portfolio  transactions in process  as well as lease transactions assigned to lenders  if the company retains a residual investment in the leased property subject to those leases 
an ongoing review of all leases ten or more days delinquent is conducted 
lessees who are delinquent with the company or an assignee are coded in the company s accounting and tracking systems in order to provide management visibility  periodic reporting  and appropriate reserves 
the accrual of interest income on leases will generally be discontinued when the lessee becomes ninety days or more past due on its lease payments with the company  unless the company believes the investment is otherwise recoverable 
leases may be placed on non accrual earlier if the company has significant doubt about the ability of the lessee to meet its lease obligations  as evidenced by consistent delinquency  deterioratio n in the lessee s financial condition or other relevant factors 
the following table summarizes the company s non performing capital leases june  non performing capital leases in thousands non accrual leases restructured leases leases past due days other than above total non performing capital leases non performing assets as of total investment in capital leases non performing assets decreased during fiscal due in part to positive results from the workout of leases in bankruptcy and in part to the write off of other non performing assets 
direct finance income that would have been recorded had non performing leases at each respective fiscal year end been current in accordance with their original terms would have been   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
the amount of direct finance income actually recorded on non performing capital leases was   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition to the non performing capital leases identified above  there were million of investment in capital leases at june  for which management has concerns regarding the ability of the lessees to continue to meet existing lease obligations  compared with million at june  this amount consists of leases classified as substandard or doubtful  or with lessees that currently are experiencing financial difficulties or that management believes may experience financial difficulties in the future 
the decline reflects the benefits of rental payments received related to earlier problem leases  without any significant additions to this category 
allowance for lease losses the allowance for lease losses provides coverage for probable and estimatable losses in the company s lease portfolios 
the allowance recorded is based on a quarterly review of all leases outstanding and transactions in process 
lease receivables or residuals are charged off when they are deemed completely uncollectible 
the determination of the appropriate amount of any provision is based on management s judgment at that time and takes into consideration all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect the lease portfolio 
years ended june  dollars in thousands net investment in capital leases at year end allowance for lease losses at beginning of year charge off of lease receivables recovery of amounts previously written off provision for lease losses allowance for lease losses at end of year allowance for lease losses as percent of net investment in capital leases before allowances the allowance for lease losses decreased to million of net investment in capital leases at june  from million of net investment in capital leases at june  the allowance at june  consisted of million allocated to specific accounts and million that was allocated to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
this compared to million allocated to specific accounts at june  and million that was allocated to cover losses inherent in the portfolio at such date 
the decrease in the allowance relates to a reduction in specific non performing or problem leases  and the write off of non performing leases against the allowance 
the increase in the unallocated allowance relates to an increase in the net investment in capital leases  growth in the volume of transactions in process and the volume of unfunded lease commitments 
the compa ny considers the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at june  adequate to cover losses specifically identified as well as inherent in the lease portfolios 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will not  in any particular period  sustain lease losses that are sizeable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the lease portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions and the on going credit review process  will not require significant increases in the allowance for lease losses 
among other factors  a continued economic slowdown may have an adverse impact on the adequacy of the allowance for lease losses by increasing credit risk and the risk of potential loss even further 
as the company has retained a significantly greater percentage of leases in its own portfolio  this creates increased exposure to delinquencies  repossessions  foreclosures and losses than the company has historically experienced 
liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operating activities through internally generated funds  bank deposits and non recourse debt 
at june  and  the company s cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively 
stockholders equity at june  was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  at june  at june   the company and the bank exceed their regulatory capital requirements and are considered well capitalized under guidelines established by the frb and the occ 
deposits at calfirst bank totaled million at june   compared to million at june  the million increase was used to fund leases and maintain liquidity at the bank 
the following table presents average balances and average rates paid on deposits for years ended june  and dollars in thousands years ended june  average average average average balance rate paid balance rate paid non interest bearing demand deposits n a n a interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits less than  time deposits   or more the leasing companies capital expenditures for leased property purchases are sometimes financed by assigning certain base lease term payments to banks or other financial institutions  including calfirst bank 
the assigned lease payments are discounted at fixed rates such that the lease payments are sufficient to fully amortize the aggregate outstanding debt 
at june   the company had outstanding non recourse debt aggregating million relating to property under capital leases 
in the past  the company has been able to obtain adequate non recourse funding commitments  and the company believes it will be able to do so in the future 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes various contractual obligations to make future payments and receive future payments at june  commitments to purchase property for unfunded leases are binding and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since the company expects some of the commitments to expire without being funded  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent the company s future liquidity requirements 
due by period contractual obligations total less than year years after years dollars in thousands time deposits less than     time deposits  or more    deposits without a stated maturity   operating lease rental expense   lease property purchases   total contractual commitments    contractual cash receipts lease payments receivable    cash current balance   total projected cash availability    net projected cash inflow    disbursements to purchase property on approved leases are estimated to be completed within one year  but it is likely that some portion could be deferred to fiscal based upon contractual cash flows  amounts could differ due to prepayments  lease restructures  charge offs and other factors 
the need for cash for operating activities will increase as the company expands 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flow from operations  cash flows from its financing and investing activities  and assignments on a non recourse basis of lease payments will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable financing needs 
inflation has not had a significant impact upon the operations of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from changes in market indices such as interest rates and equity prices 
the company s principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk  which is the exposure due to differences in the repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s balance sheet structure is primarily short term in nature  with a greater portion of assets that reprice or mature within one year 
as a result  the company s exposure to interest rate risk largely results from declines in interest rates and the impact on net direct finance and interest income 
at june   the company had million invested in securities of very short duration  including million in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
the company s investment in capital leases of million consists of leases with fixed rates  however  million of such investment is due within one year of june  this compares to the bank s interest earning deposit liabilities of million  of which mature within one year 
non recourse debt does not represent an interest rate risk to the company because it is fully amortized through direct payments from lessees to the purchaser of the lease receivable 
based on the foregoing  at june   the company had assets of million subject to changes in interest rates over the next twelve months  compared to repricing liabilities of million 
as interest rates decrease  interest income on the company s large short term inve stment position decreases  and future lease rates from direct financing leases  which often are based on united states treasury rates  tend to be lower 
conversely  as interest rates rise  the company s earnings will benefit as yields on cash investments and lease investments improve  with little offsetting impact from rising interest expense 
as the banking operations of the company grow and the bank s deposits represent a greater portion of the company s assets  the company will be subject to increased interest rate risk 
the bank has an asset liability management committee and policies established to manage its interest rate risk 
the bank measures its asset liability position through duration measures and sensitivity analysis  and calculates the potential effect on earnings using maturity gap analysis 
the interest rate sensitivity modeling includes the creation of prospective twelve month baseline and rate shocked net interest income simulations 
after a baseline net interest income is determined  using assumptions that the bank deems reasonable  market interest rates are raised or lowered by to basis points instantaneously  parallel across the entire yield curve  and a rate shocked simulation is run 
interest rate sensitivity is then measured as the difference betwe en calculated baseline and rate shocked net interest income 
at this time  the results of the bank s analysis are not material to the company as a whole
