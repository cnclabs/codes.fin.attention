item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue and expense amounts 
revenue recognition kodak recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
for the sale of multiple element arrangements whereby equipment is combined with services  including maintenance and training  and other elements  including software and products  the company allocates to  and recognizes revenue from  the various elements based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value if software is not included or is incidental to the transaction or kodak specific objective evidence of fair value if software is included and is other than incidental to the sales transaction as a whole 
for full service solutions sales  which consist of the sale of equipment and software which may or may not require significant production  modification or customization  there are two acceptable methods of accounting percentage of completion accounting and completed contract accounting 
for certain of the company s full service solutions  the completed contract method of accounting is being followed by the company 
this is due to insufficient historical experience resulting in the inability to provide reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to the various stages of such contracts as would be necessary under the percentage of completion methodology 
when the company does have sufficient historical experience and the ability to provide reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and the costs applicable to the various stages of these contracts  the company will account for these full service solutions under the percentage of completion methodology 
at the time revenue is recognized  the company also records reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given from a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
such incentive programs include cash and volume discounts  price protection  promotional  cooperative and other advertising allowances  and coupons 
for those incentives that require the estimation of sales volumes or redemption rates  such as for volume rebates or coupons  the company uses historical experience and internal and customer data to estimate the sales incentive at the time revenue is recognized 
in the event that the actual results of these items differ from the estimates  adjustments to the sales incentive accruals would be recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts kodak regularly analyzes its customer accounts and  when it becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s overall financial condition  records a specific provision for uncollectible accounts to reduce the related receivable to the amount that is estimated to be collectible 
the company also records and maintains a provision for doubtful accounts for customers based on a variety of factors including the company s historical experience  the length of time the receivable has been outstanding and the financial condition of the customer 
if circumstances related to specific customers were to change  the company s estimates with respect to the collectibility of the related receivables could be further adjusted 
however  losses in the aggregate have not exceeded management s expectations 
inventories kodak reduces the carrying value of its inventory based on estimates of what is excess  slow moving and obsolete  as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these write downs are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if  in the future  the company determined that market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected and  therefore  inventory was overvalued  the company would be required to further reduce the carrying value of the inventory and record a charge to earnings at the time such determination was made 
if  in the future  the company determined that inventory write downs were overstated and  therefore  inventory was undervalued  the company would recognize the increase to earnings through higher gross profit at the time the related undervalued inventory was sold 
however  actual results have not differed materially from management s estimates 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  by first grouping its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group and  secondly  estimating the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise from the use of and eventual disposition of such asset group 
the company estimates the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group 
if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the company records an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the company determines fair value through quoted market prices in active markets or  if quoted market prices are unavailable  through the performance of internal analyses of discounted cash flows or external appraisals 
the undiscounted and discounted cash flow analyses are based on a number of estimates and assumptions  including the expected period over which the asset will be utilized  projected future operating results of the asset group  discount rate and long term growth rate 
to assess goodwill for impairment  the company performs an assessment of the carrying value of its reporting units on an annual basis or when events and changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company s reporting units below their carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company would record an impairment charge to earnings to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units through internal analyses and external valuations  which utilize income and market valuation approaches through the application of capitalized earnings  discounted cash flow and market comparable methods 
these valuation techniques are based on a number of estimates and assumptions  including the projected future operating results of the reporting unit  discount rate  long term growth rate and appropriate market comparables 
the company s assessments of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets  and its periodic review of the remaining useful lives of its long lived assets are an integral part of the company s ongoing strategic review of the business and operations  and are also performed in conjunction with the company s periodic restructuring actions 
therefore  future changes in the company s strategy  the ongoing digital substitution  the continuing shift from overnight photofinishing to onsite processing and other changes in the operations of the company could impact the projected future operating results that are inherent in the company s estimates of fair value  resulting in impairments in the future 
additionally  other changes in the estimates and assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term growth rate  which drive the valuation techniques employed to estimate the fair value of long lived assets and goodwill could change and  therefore  impact the assessments of impairment in the future 
in performing the annual assessment of goodwill for impairment  the company determined that no material reporting units carrying values were close to exceeding their respective fair values 
see goodwill under note  significant accounting policies 
investments in equity securities kodak holds minority interests in certain publicly traded and privately held companies having operations or technology within its strategic areas of focus 
the company s policy is to record an impairment charge on these investments when they experience declines in value that are considered to be other than temporary 
poor operating results of the investees or adverse changes in market conditions in the future may cause losses or an inability of the company to recover its carrying value in these underlying investments 
the remaining carrying value of the company s investments in these equity securities is million at december  income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
at december   the company has deferred tax assets for its net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  relating to which the company has a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the company has considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the company operates  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for these valuation allowances 
if kodak were to determine that it would not be able to realize a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if the company were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which there is currently a valuation allowance would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
the company s effective tax rate considers the impact of undistributed earnings of subsidiary companies outside of the us deferred taxes have not been provided for the potential remittance of such undistributed earnings  as it is the company s policy to permanently reinvest its retained earnings 
however  from time to time and to the extent that the company can repatriate overseas earnings on a tax free basis  the company s foreign subsidiaries will pay dividends to the us material changes in the company s working capital and long term investment requirements could impact the decisions made by management with respect to the level and source of future remittances and  as a result  the company s effective tax rate 
see note  income taxes 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the company 
conversely  if these issues are resolved favorably in the future  the related provisions would be reduced  thus having a positive impact on earnings 
warranty obligations management estimates expected product failure rates  material usage and service costs in the development of its warranty obligations 
in the event that the actual results of these items differ from the estimates  an adjustment to the warranty obligation would be recorded 
pension and postretirement benefits kodak s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions  which are reviewed annually by the company  include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
the company bases the discount rate assumption for its significant plans on the estimated rate at which annuity contracts could be purchased to discharge the pension benefit obligation 
in estimating that rate  the company looks to the aa rated corporate long term bond yield rate in the respective country as of the last day of the year in the company s reporting period as a guide 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a combination of formal asset and liability studies  historical results of the portfolio  and management s expectation as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on the company s long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of the likely long term trends 
the company evaluates its expected long term rate of return on plan asset eroa assumption annually for the kodak retirement income plan krip 
to facilitate this evaluation  every two to three years  or when market conditions change materially  the company undertakes a new asset and liability study to reaffirm the current asset allocation and the related eroa assumption 
wilshire associates  a consulting firm  completed a study the study in september  which led to several asset allocation shifts and a decrease in the eroa from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the eroa for will remain at 
given the decrease in the discount rate of basis points from for to for and increased recognition of unrecognized losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  total pension income for the major funded and unfunded defined benefit plans in the us is expected to decrease from million in to pension income in the range of million to million in this decrease in income will be partially offset by an expected decrease in pension expense in the company s non us plans in the range of million to million in additionally  due in part to the decrease in the discount rate from for to for and increased amortization expense relating to the unrecognized actuarial loss  the company expects the cost of its most significant postretirement benefit plan  the us plan  to be in a range of million to million in  as compared with million in these estimates have been incorporated into the company s earnings outlook for actual results that differ from our assumptions are recorded as unrecognized gains and losses and are amortized to earnings over the estimated future service period of the plan participants to the extent such total net recognized gains and losses exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligation or the market related value of assets 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in future assumptions would affect the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations 
in accordance with the guidance under sfas no 
 the company is required to record an additional minimum pension liability in its consolidated statement of financial position that is at least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation of its defined benefit pension plans 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the improved performance in the global equity markets  partially offset by decreasing discount rates in  the company decreased its net additional minimum pension liability by million and recorded a corresponding credit to accumulated other comprehensive income a component of shareholders equity of million  net of taxes of million 
if the global equity markets performance continues to improve and discount rates stabilize or improve in future periods  the company may be in a position to further reduce its additional minimum pension liability and reverse the corresponding charges to shareholders equity 
conversely  if the global equity markets performance and discount rates were to decline in future periods  the company may be required to increase its additional minimum pension liability and record additional charges to shareholders equity 
to mitigate the increase in its additional minimum pension liability and additional charges to shareholders equity  the company may elect to fund a particular plan or plans on a case by case basis 
environmental commitments environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures 
the liabilities include accruals for sites owned by kodak  sites formerly owned by kodak  and other third party sites where kodak was designated as a potentially responsible party prp 
the amounts accrued for such sites are based on these estimates  which are determined using the astm standard e  standard guide for estimating monetary costs and liabilities for environmental matters 
the overall method includes the use of a probabilistic model that forecasts a range of cost estimates for the remediation required at individual sites 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for remediation and long term monitoring of the sites 
such estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of remediation 
kodak s estimate of its environmental liabilities may also change if the proposals to regulatory agencies for desired methods and outcomes of remediation are viewed as not acceptable  or additional exposures are identified 
the company has an ongoing monitoring and identification process to assess how activities  with respect to the known exposures  are progressing against the accrued cost estimates  as well as to identify other potential remediation sites that are presently unknown

a total of  positions were eliminated under the restructuring programs 
the remaining severance reserve of million as of december  has not been paid since  in many instances  the employees whose positions were eliminated could elect or were required to receive their severance payments over an extended period of time 
however  these payments will be made by the end of most of the remaining exit costs reserves of million as of december  represent long term lease payments  which will be paid over periods after liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents increased million during to  million at december  the increase resulted primarily from  million of cash flows from operating activities and million of cash provided by financing activities  partially offset by  million of cash flows used in investing activities 
the net cash provided by operating activities of  million for the year ended december  was partially attributable to net earnings of million which  when adjusted for earnings from discontinued operations  equity in losses from unconsolidated affiliates  gain on sale of assets  depreciation and goodwill amortization  purchased research and development  benefit for deferred income taxes and restructuring costs  asset impairments and other charges  provided  million of operating cash 
also contributing to net cash provided by operating activities were a decrease in inventories of million  an increase in liabilities excluding borrowings of million  the cash receipt of million in connection with the sterling winthrop settlement  and the million impact of the change in other items  net  which were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the net cash used in investing activities of  million was utilized primarily for business acquisitions of million  of which million related to the purchase of minority interests in china and india  capital expenditures of million  investments in unconsolidated affiliates of million  and net purchases of marketable securities of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of assets of million 
the net cash provided by financing activities of million was primarily the result of the net increase in borrowings of million and the exercise of employee stock options of million  which were partially offset by dividend payments of million 
net working capital  excluding short term borrowings  increased to  million from million at year end including short term borrowings  net working capital increased to positive million from negative million at year end this increase is mainly attributable to higher cash balances and a reduction in short term debt  partially offset by higher accounts payable and other current liabilities 
the decrease in short term debt is primarily because the company no longer regularly accesses the commercial paper short term debt market in managing its working capital to fund its operating and investing activities 
during the second quarter of  the company issued million of long term debt to replace million of short term debt resulting in improved working capital 
additionally  on october   the company issued  million of long term debt  comprised of million of senior notes due and million of convertible senior notes due  a portion of which has been used to repay commercial paper  thus improving working capital 
see further discussion in this section relating to these long term debt issuances 
the company maintains  million in committed bank lines of credit and  million in uncommitted bank lines of credit to ensure continued access to short term borrowing capacity 
on september   the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s the new debt shelf registration for the issuance of up to  million of new debt securities 
pursuant to rule under the securities act of  million of remaining unsold debt securities under a prior shelf registration statement were included in the new debt shelf registration  thus giving the company the ability to issue up to  million in public debt 
these funding alternatives provide the company with sufficient flexibility and liquidity to meet its working capital and investing needs 
however  the success of future public debt issuances will be dependent on market conditions at the time of such an offering 
the company s primary estimated future uses of cash for include the following dividend payments  debt reductions  and acquisitions 
the company has a dividend policy whereby it makes semi annual payments which  when declared  will be paid on the company s th business day each july and december to shareholders of record on the first business day of the preceding month 
on april   the company s board of directors declared a semi annual cash dividend of 
per share on the outstanding common stock of the company 
this dividend was paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  on september   the company s board of directors approved the reduction of the amount of the annual dividend to 
per share 
on that same date  the company s board of directors declared a semi annual cash dividend of 
per share on the outstanding common stock of the company 
this dividend was paid on december  to the shareholders of record as of the close of business on november  capital additions were million in  with the majority of the spending supporting new products  manufacturing productivity and quality improvements  infrastructure improvements  and ongoing environmental and safety initiatives 
for the full year  the company expects its capital spending  excluding acquisitions  to be approximately million 
during  the company expended million against the related restructuring reserves  primarily for the payment of severance benefits 
employees whose positions were eliminated could elect to receive severance payments for up to two years following their date of termination 
for  the company expects to generate million to million in investable cash flow  which represents cash flow after dividends but before acquisitions and excludes the impacts on cash from the purchase and sale of marketable securities  the impacts from debt and transactions in the company s own equity  such as stock repurchases and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the investable cash flow range of million to million does not include million of expected pre tax cash proceeds from the february announced sale of the remote sensing systems operation  including research systems  inc  to itt industries  inc  nor does it consider the cash impact of the nexpress acquisition  which was announced in march  once it becomes a kodak wholly owned subsidiary 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover its working capital and capital investment needs and the funds required for future debt reduction  dividend payments  or modest acquisitions 
the company s cash balances and financing arrangements will be used to bridge timing differences between expenditures and cash generated from operations 
the company has  million in committed revolving credit facilities  which are available for general corporate purposes including the support of the company s commercial paper program 
the credit facilities are comprised of the  million day committed revolving credit facility day facility expiring in july and a year committed facility at  million expiring in july year facility 
if unused  they have a commitment fee of million per year at the company s current credit rating of baa and bbb from moody s and standard poors s p  respectively 
interest on amounts borrowed under these facilities is calculated at rates based on spreads above certain reference rates and the company s credit rating 
under the day facility and year facility  there is a financial covenant that requires the company to maintain a debt to ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ratio of not greater than to in the event of violation of the covenant  the facility would not be available for borrowing until the covenant provisions were waived  amended or satisfied 
the company was in compliance with this covenant at december  the company does not anticipate that a violation is likely to occur 
the company has other committed and uncommitted lines of credit at december  totaling million and  million  respectively 
these lines primarily support borrowing needs of the company s subsidiaries  which include term loans  overdraft coverage  letters of credit and revolving credit lines 
interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country  depending on local market conditions 
total outstanding borrowings against these other committed and uncommitted lines of credit at december  were million and million  respectively 
these outstanding borrowings are reflected in the short term borrowings and long term debt  net of current portion balances in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at december  at december   the company had million in commercial paper outstanding  with a weighted average interest rate of 
to provide additional financing flexibility  the company has an accounts receivable securitization program  which provides for borrowings up to a maximum of million 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under this program 
on october   the company completed the offering and sale of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes  which was made pursuant to the company s new debt shelf registration 
interest on the notes will accrue at the rate of per annum and is payable semiannually 
the notes are not redeemable at the company s option or repayable at the option of any holder prior to maturity 
the notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of the company s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
after issuance of the above debt  the company has  million of availability remaining under the new debt shelf registration 
concurrent with the offering and sale of the notes  on october   the company completed the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the convertible securities to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of interest on the convertible securities will accrue at the rate of per annum and is payable semiannually 
the convertible securities are unsecured and rank equally with all of the company s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
as a condition of the private placement  the company agreed to initially file within days and make effective within days after the earliest date of original issuance of the convertible securities  a shelf registration statement under the securities act of relating to the resale of the convertible securities and the common stock to be issued upon conversion of the convertible securities pursuant to a registration rights agreement 
the company filed this shelf registration statement on january   and made it effective on february  the convertible securities contain a number of conversion features that include substantive contingencies 
the convertible securities are convertible by the holders at an initial conversion rate of shares of the company s common stock for each  principal amount of the convertible securities  which is equal to an initial conversion price of per share 
the holders may convert their convertible securities  in whole or in part  into shares of the company s common stock under any of the following circumstances during any calendar quarter  if the price of the company s common stock is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price for at least trading days during a consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous calendar quarter  during any five consecutive trading day period following any consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the convertible securities for each day of such period is less than of the conversion value  and the conversion value for each day of such period was less than of the principal amount of the convertible securities the parity clause  if the company has called the convertible securities for redemption  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions such as a consolidation  merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which the company s common stock would be converted into cash  property or securities  and if the credit rating assigned to the convertible securities by either moody s or s p is lower than ba or bb  respectively  which represents a three notch downgrade from the company s current standing  or if the convertible securities are no longer rated by at least one of these services or their successors the credit rating clause 
the company may redeem some or all of the convertible securities at any time on or after october  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible securities plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
upon a call for redemption by the company  a conversion trigger is met whereby the holder of each  convertible senior note may convert such note to shares of the company s common stock 
the holders have the right to require the company to purchase their convertible securities for cash at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible securities plus any accrued and unpaid interest on october   october   october   october  and october   or upon a fundamental change as described in the offering memorandum filed under rule a in conjunction with the private placement of the convertible securities 
as of december   the company reserved  shares in treasury stock to cover potential future conversions of these convertible securities into common stock 
certain of the conversion features contained in the convertible securities are deemed to be embedded derivatives as defined under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these embedded derivatives include the parity clause  the credit rating clause  and any specified corporate transaction outside of the company s control such as a hostile takeover 
based on an external valuation  these embedded derivatives were not material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  as the contingencies surrounding the conversion features are substantive  the shares to be potentially issued upon triggering a conversion event will be excluded from the earnings per share calculation until such time as a contingency lapses and the effect of issuing such shares is dilutive 
if and when a contingency lapses and the effect of issuing such shares is dilutive  then the shares issued would be included in the denominator of the earnings per share calculation  and the interest expense incurred on the convertible securities would be excluded from the numerator of the earnings per share calculation for the respective period

the company s debt ratings were downgraded during by each of the three major rating agencies 
moody s  standard poors s p and fitch ratings for long term debt l t and short term debt s t  including their outlook  at the beginning and end of were as follows december  december  l t s t outlook l t s t outlook moody s baa p stable baa p negative s p bbb a stable bbb a negative fitch a f negative bbb f negative the long term and short term debt rating downgrades and negative outlooks reflect the rating agencies concerns about the company s weakened sales and profitability in the core photographic businesses due to continuing pricing pressure from competitors  continued digital substitution  including doubts about the profit potential of digital imaging relative to conventional photography  unfavorable economic factors  including reduced leisure travel  potential future restructuring actions that may restrict cash flow  slowing efforts to reduce debt  the likelihood that debt reduction will be slowed in the short to medium term due to the company s rising business risk  investment strategies  and the rapid pace at which it has made its recent acquisitions  and the financial burden of its significant unfunded postretirement benefit liabilities 
these credit rating actions have limited the company s access to commercial paper borrowings 
as a result and as noted before  on october   the company issued  million of long term debt through an offering and sale of million of senior notes due and a concurrent private placement of million of convertible senior notes due  which were filed in a shelf registration statement on january  and made effective on february  with the proceeds received from the  million of long term debt issued  the company retired approximately million of outstanding commercial paper and all of the outstanding borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization program  which amounted to approximately million 
the remaining proceeds were used to fund the practiceworks  inc acquisition 
for  the company expects interest expense to increase relative to as a result of the replacement of outstanding commercial paper with new long term debt 
for example  the company s outstanding commercial paper at december  had a weighted average annual interest rate of as compared with an annual interest rate of on the senior notes and on the convertible senior notes  representing a weighted average difference of percentage points 
the company is in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in its credit agreements and indentures 
further  the company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its debt  with the exception of the following the outstanding borrowings  if any  under the accounts receivable securitization program if the company s credit ratings from s p or moody s were to fall below bbb and baa  respectively  and such condition continued for a period of days 
however  as previously noted  the company had no outstanding borrowings under this program as of december  additionally  the company estimates that letters of credit or other financial support could be required in support of insurance  environmental and supplier obligations of up to million 
further downgrades in the company s credit rating or disruptions in the capital markets could impact borrowing costs and the nature of its funding alternatives 
however  the company has access to  million in committed revolving credit facilities to meet unanticipated funding needs should it be necessary 
the company guarantees debt and other obligations under agreements with certain affiliated companies and customers 
at december   these guarantees totaled a maximum of million  with outstanding guaranteed amounts of million 
the maximum guarantee amount includes guarantees of up to million of debt for kpg million outstanding  million for other unconsolidated affiliates and third parties million outstanding  and million of customer amounts due to banks in connection with various banks financing of customers purchase of products and equipment from kodak million outstanding 
the kpg debt facility and the related guarantee mature on december   but may be renewed at kpg s  the joint ventures partners and the bank s discretion 
the guarantees for the other unconsolidated affiliates and third party debt mature between january and may the customer financing agreements and related guarantees typically have a term of days for product and short term equipment financing arrangements  and up to years for long term equipment financing arrangements 
these guarantees would require payment from kodak only in the event of default on payment by the respective debtor 
in some cases  particularly for guarantees related to equipment financing  the company has collateral or recourse provisions to recover and sell the equipment to reduce any losses that might be incurred in connection with the guarantee 
management believes the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under any of the guarantees disclosed above 
with respect to the guarantees that the company issued in the year ended december   the company assessed the fair value of its obligation to stand ready to perform under these guarantees by considering the likelihood of occurrence of the specified triggering events or conditions requiring performance as well as other assumptions and factors 
through internal analyses and external valuations  the company determined that the fair value of the guarantees was not material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company also guarantees debt owed to banks for some of its consolidated subsidiaries 
the maximum amount guaranteed is million  and the outstanding debt under those guarantees  which is recorded within the short term borrowings and long term debt  net of current portion components in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position  is million 
these guarantees expire in and  with the majority expiring in the company may provide up to million in loan guarantees to support funding needs for sk display corporation  an unconsolidated affiliate in which the company has a ownership interest 
as of december   the company has not been required to guarantee any of the sk display corporation s outstanding debt 
the company issues indemnifications in certain instances when it sells businesses and real estate  and in the ordinary course of business with its customers  suppliers  service providers and business partners 
further  the company indemnifies its directors and officers who are  or were  serving at kodak s request in such capacities 
historically  costs incurred to settle claims related to these indemnifications have not been material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  the fair value of the indemnifications that the company issued during the year ended december  was not material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
due to improved performance in the global equity markets in  partially offset by the decline in the discount rates from december  to december   the company decreased its additional minimum pension liability by million and recorded a corresponding credit to the accumulated other comprehensive loss income component of equity of million  net of tax benefits of million 
the decrease in the additional minimum pension liability of million was recorded in the postretirement liabilities component on the consolidated statement of financial position at december  the decrease in this component of million from december  to december  is primarily attributable to the decrease in the additional minimum pension liability and the decrease in the accrued pension benefit liability  partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange 
the company recorded the reduction in the deferred income tax asset of million in the other long term assets component within the consolidated statement of financial position 
the net increase in this component of million from december  to december  is partially attributable to the increase in the prepaid pension asset  partially offset by the decrease in the deferred income tax asset 
the increase in the prepaid pension asset is primarily attributable to million of pension income generated from the us pension plans in and the impact of foreign exchange 
during the fourth quarter of  the company funded one of its non us defined benefit pension plans in the amount of approximately million 
the company does not expect to have significant funding requirements relating to its defined benefit pension plans in qualex  a wholly owned subsidiary of kodak  has a ownership interest in express stop financing esf  which is a joint venture partnership between qualex and a subsidiary of dana credit corporation dcc  a wholly owned subsidiary of dana corporation 
qualex accounts for its investment in esf under the equity method of accounting 
esf provides a long term financing solution to qualex s photofinishing customers in connection with qualex s leasing of photofinishing equipment to third parties  as opposed to qualex extending long term credit 
as part of the operations of its photofinishing services  qualex sells equipment under a sales type lease arrangement and records a long term receivable 
these long term receivables are subsequently sold to esf without recourse to qualex and  therefore  these receivables are removed from qualex s books 
esf incurs debt to finance the purchase of the receivables from qualex 
this debt is collateralized solely by the long term receivables purchased from qualex and  in part  by a million guarantee from dcc 
qualex provides no guarantee or collateral to esf s creditors in connection with the debt  and esf s debt is non recourse to qualex 
qualex s only continued involvement in connection with the sale of the long term receivables is the servicing of the related equipment under the leases 
qualex has continued revenue streams in connection with this equipment through future sales of photofinishing consumables  including paper and chemicals  and maintenance 
although the lessees requirement to pay esf under the lease agreements is not contingent upon qualex s fulfillment of its servicing obligations  under the agreement with esf  qualex would be responsible for any deficiency in the amount of rent not paid to esf as a result of any lessee s claim regarding maintenance or supply services not provided by qualex 
such lease payments would be made in accordance with the original lease terms  which generally extend over to years

the company expects to contribute approximately million and million  respectively  to its us defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans in the company s cash and cash equivalents increased million during to million at december  the increase resulted primarily from  million of cash flows from operating activities  partially offset by million of cash flows used in investing activities and  million of cash used in financing activities 
the net cash provided by operating activities of  million for the year ended december  was partially attributable to net earnings of million which  when adjusted for depreciation and amortization  and restructuring costs  asset impairments and other charges  provided  million of operating cash  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventories of million  proceeds from the surrender of its company owned life insurance policies of million  and an increase in liabilities excluding borrowings of million  related primarily to severance payments for restructuring programs 
the net cash used in investing activities of million was utilized primarily for capital expenditures of million  investments in unconsolidated affiliates of million  business acquisitions of million  of which million related to the purchase of minority interests in china and india  and net purchases of marketable securities of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of properties of million 
the net cash used in financing activities of  million was primarily the result of net debt repayments of million  dividend payments of million and the repurchase of million kodak shares held by krip for million 
of the million expended  million was repurchased under the stock repurchase program  which is now completed 
the balance of the amount expended of million was repurchased under the stock repurchase program 
net working capital  excluding short term borrowings  decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities  an increase in accrued income taxes  lower receivables and lower inventories partially offset by a higher cash balance 
on april   the company s board of directors declared a semi annual cash dividend of 
per share on the outstanding common stock of the company

per share on the outstanding common stock of the company 
this dividend was paid to the shareholders of record at the close of business on december  capital additions were million in  with the majority of the spending supporting new products  manufacturing productivity and quality improvements  infrastructure improvements  and ongoing environmental and safety initiatives 
the cash outflows for severance and exit costs associated with the restructuring charges recorded in will be more than offset by the tax savings associated with the restructuring actions  primarily due to the tax benefit of million relating to the consolidation of its photofinishing operations in japan recorded in the third quarter restructuring charge 
during  the company expended million against the related restructuring reserves  primarily for the payment of severance benefits  which were mostly attributable to the restructuring actions 
the remaining severance related actions associated with the total restructuring charge were completed by the end of the first quarter of  and the remaining severance payments of million at december  will be made by the end of employees whose positions were eliminated could elect to receive severance payments for up to two years following their date of termination 
net cash provided by operating activities in was  million  as net earnings of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  and restructuring costs  asset impairments and other charges  provided  million of operating cash 
also contributing to operating cash was a decrease in receivables of million and a decrease in inventories of million

dividends  when declared  will be paid on the th business day of july and december to shareholders of record on the first business day of the preceding month 
these payment dates serve to better align the dividend disbursements with the seasonal cash flow pattern of the business  which is more concentrated in the second half of the year 
this action resulted in the company making five dividend payments in net working capital  excluding short term borrowings  decreased to million from  million at year end this decrease is mainly attributable to lower receivable and inventory balances  as discussed above 
capital additions  excluding equipment purchased for lease  were million in  with the majority of the spending supporting new products  manufacturing productivity and quality improvements  infrastructure improvements  ongoing environmental and safety initiatives  and renovations due to relocations associated with restructuring actions taken in under the  million stock repurchase program announced on april   the company repurchased million of its shares in as of march   the company suspended the stock repurchase program in a move designed to accelerate debt reduction and increase financial flexibility

the net cash cost of the restructuring charge recorded in was approximately million after tax  which was recovered through cost savings in less than two years 
the severance related actions associated with this charge were completed by the end of the first quarter of  and the remaining severance payments of million at december  will be made by the end of other cash expenditures for pollution prevention and waste treatment for the company s current facilities were as follows in millions recurring costs for pollution prevention and waste treatment capital expenditures for pollution prevention and waste treatment site remediation costs total at december  and  the company s undiscounted accrued liabilities for environmental remediation costs amounted to million and million  respectively 
these amounts are reported in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position 
the company is currently implementing a corrective action program required by the resource conservation and recovery act rcra at the kodak park site in rochester  ny 
as part of this program  the company has completed the rcra facility assessment rfa  a broad based environmental investigation of the site 
the company is currently in the process of completing  and in some cases has completed  rcra facility investigations rfi and corrective measures studies cms for areas at the site 
the previous estimate for future investigation and remediation costs was reduced by million for the following reasons approval of final corrective measures for four investigation areas  approval for a single investigation approach for the site s industrial sewers and building waste water collection system  and completion with no further action approvals at seventeen solid waste management units 
at december   estimated future investigation and remediation costs of million are accrued for this site and are included in the million reported in other long term liabilities 
the company has retained certain obligations for environmental remediation and superfund matters related to certain sites associated with the non imaging health businesses sold in at the ohio site  agreements reached with the ohio environmental protection agency in regard to the calculation of clean up levels  as well as the long term viability of the facility as an industrial site  allowed the previous estimate to be reduced by million 
at december   estimated future remediation costs of million are accrued for these sites and are included in the million reported in other long term liabilities 
the company has obligations relating to two former manufacturing sites located outside of the united states 
at december   estimated future investigation  remediation and monitoring costs of million are accrued for these sites and are included in the million reported in other long term liabilities 
as a result of the ongoing monitoring and identification process  the company has identified seven additional operating sites with an estimated future investigation  remediation and monitoring cost of million 
these costs are accrued and are included in the million reported in other long term liabilities 
additionally  the company has approximately million accrued in the million reported in other long term liabilities at december  for remediation relating to other facilities  which are not material to the company s financial position  results of operations  cash flows or competitive position 
cash expenditures for the aforementioned investigation  remediation and monitoring activities are expected to be incurred over the next thirty years for many of the sites 
for these known environmental exposures  the accrual reflects the company s best estimate of the amount it will incur under the agreed upon or proposed work plans 
the company s cost estimates were determined using the astm standard e  standard guide for estimating monetary costs and liabilities for environmental matters  and have not been reduced by possible recoveries from third parties 
the overall method includes the use of a probabilistic model which forecasts a range of cost estimates for the remediation required at individual sites 
the projects are closely monitored and the models are reviewed as significant events occur or at least once per year 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for remediation and long term monitoring of the sites 
the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that the losses for the known exposures could exceed the current accruals by material amounts 
a consent decree was signed in in settlement of a civil complaint brought by the us environmental protection agency and the us department of justice 
in connection with the consent decree  the company is subject to a compliance schedule  under which the company has improved its waste characterization procedures  upgraded one of its incinerators  and is evaluating and upgrading its industrial sewer system 
the total expenditures required to complete this program are currently estimated to be approximately million over the next five years 
these expenditures are incurred as part of plant operations and  therefore  are not included in the environmental accrual at december  the company is presently designated as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended the superfund law  or under similar state laws  for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of the company s alleged arrangements for disposal of hazardous substances at four such active sites 
with respect to each of these sites  the company s liability is minimal 
in addition  the company has been identified as a prp in connection with the non imaging health businesses in four active superfund sites 
numerous other prps have also been designated at these sites 
although the law imposes joint and several liability on prps  the company s historical experience demonstrates that these costs are shared with other prps 
settlements and costs paid by the company in superfund matters to date have not been material 
future costs are also not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the clean air act amendments were enacted in expenditures to comply with the clean air act implementing regulations issued to date have not been material and have been primarily capital in nature 
in addition  future expenditures for existing regulations  which are primarily capital in nature  are not expected to be material 
many of the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to this act have not been issued 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
a finite estimate of cost does not normally become fixed and determinable at a specific time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability  and the company continually updates its cost estimates 
the company has an ongoing monitoring and identification process to assess how the activities  with respect to the known exposures  are progressing against the accrued cost estimates  as well as to identify other potential remediation sites that are presently unknown 
estimates of the amount and timing of future costs of environmental remediation requirements are necessarily imprecise because of the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of presently unknown remediation sites and the allocation of costs among the potentially responsible parties 
based upon information presently available  such future costs are not expected to have a material effect on the company s competitive or financial position 
however  such costs could be material to results of operations in a particular future quarter or year

kodak recently announced plans to emphasize digital technology to expand into a range of commercial businesses in order to create a more balanced and diversified business portfolio while accelerating the implementation of its existing digital product strategies in the consumer markets 
kodak expects to incur restructuring charges in relation to these initiatives 
the expected benefits from these initiatives are subject to many estimates and assumptions  including assumptions regarding the amount and timing of cost savings and cash flow that kodak can achieve from its traditional consumer film and paper businesses  the speed at which consumer transition from traditional photography to digital photography occurs  kodak s ability to develop new digital businesses in its commercial  consumer and health markets  kodak s ability to identify and complete compatible strategic acquisitions consistent with its growth timeline  and the costs and timing of activities undertaken in connection with these initiatives 
in addition  these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic  competitive and other uncertainties that are beyond kodak s control 
if these assumptions are not realized  or if other unforeseen events occur  kodak s results of operations could be adversely affected  as it may not be able to grow its business  and its ability to compete could be negatively affected 
unanticipated delays in implementing certain product strategies including digital products  category expansion  digitization  and oled displays could adversely affect kodak s revenues 
kodak s ability to successfully transition its existing products and develop and deploy new products requires that kodak make accurate predictions of the product development schedule as well as volumes  product mix  customer demand  sales channels  and configuration 
the process of developing new products and services is complex and often uncertain due to the frequent introduction of new products that offer improved performance and pricing 
kodak may anticipate demand and perceived market acceptance that differs from the product s realizable customer demand and revenue stream 
further  in the face of intense industry competition  any delay in the development  production or marketing of a new product could decrease any advantage kodak may have to be the first or among the first to market 
kodak s failure to carry out a product rollout in the time frame anticipated and in the quantities appropriate to customer demand  or at all  could adversely affect future demand for kodak s products and services and have an adverse effect on its business 
kodak s ability to implement its intellectual property licensing strategies could also affect the company s revenue and earnings 
kodak has invested millions of dollars in technologies and needs to protect its intellectual property 
the establishment and enforcement of licensing agreements provides a revenue stream in the form of royalties that protects kodak s ability to further innovate and help the marketplace grow 
kodak s failure to properly manage the development of its intellectual property could adversely affect the future of these patents and the market opportunities that could result from the use of this property 
kodak s failure to manage the costs associated with the pursuit of these licenses could adversely affect the profitability of these operations 
in the event kodak were unable to develop and implement e commerce strategies that are in alignment with the trend toward industry standards and services  the company s business could be adversely affected 
the availability of software and standards related to e commerce strategies is of an emerging nature 
kodak s ability to successfully align with the industry standards and services and ensure timely solutions requires the company to make accurate predictions of the future accepted standards and services 
kodak s completion of planned information systems upgrades  including sap  if delayed  could adversely affect its business 
as kodak continues to expand the planned information services  the company must continue to balance the investment of the planned deployment with the need to upgrade the vendor software 
kodak s failure to successfully upgrade to the vendor supported version could result in risks to system availability  which could adversely affect the business 
kodak has recently completed various business acquisitions and intends to complete various other business acquisitions in the future  particularly in its health imaging and commercial imaging segments  in order to strengthen and diversify its portfolio of businesses 
at the same time  kodak needs to streamline and simplify its traditional businesses  including its photofinishing operations in the united states and eamer 
in the event that kodak fails to effectively manage the portfolio of its more traditional businesses while simultaneously integrating these acquisitions  it could fail to obtain the expected synergies and favorable impact of these acquisitions 
such a failure could cause kodak to lose market opportunities and experience a resulting adverse impact on its revenues and earnings 
in  kodak continues to focus on reduction of inventories and capital expenditures  improvement in receivable performance  and improvement in manufacturing productivity 
unanticipated delays in the company s plans to continue inventory reductions in could adversely impact kodak s cash flow outlook 
planned inventory reductions could be compromised by slower sales that could result from continued weak global economic conditions 
purchasers uncertainty about the extent of the global economic downturn could result in lower demand for products and services 
in addition  the competitive environment and the transition to digital products and services could also place pressures on kodak s sales and market share 
in the event kodak is unable to successfully manage these issues in a timely manner  they could adversely impact the planned inventory reductions 
if kodak exceeds its capital spending plan  this factor could adversely impact the company s cash flow outlook 
further  if kodak deems it necessary to spend more on regulatory requirements or if unanticipated general maintenance obligations arise that require more capital spending than planned  the increased spending could have an adverse impact on kodak s cash flow 
unanticipated delays in the company s plans to continue the improvement of its accounts receivable collection and to reduce the number of days sales outstanding could also adversely impact kodak s cash outlook 
a continued weak economy could slow customer payment patterns 
in addition  competitive pressures in major segments may cause the financial condition of certain of kodak s customers to deteriorate 
these same pressures may adversely affect the company s efforts to shorten customer payment terms 
kodak s ability to manage customer risk while maintaining a competitive market share may adversely affect continued accounts receivable improvement in delays in kodak s plans to improve manufacturing productivity and control costs of operations could negatively impact the gross margins of the company 
kodak s failure to successfully manage operational performance factors could delay or curtail planned improvements in manufacturing productivity 
accelerating digital substitution could result in lower volumes in the factory than planned  which would also negatively impact gross margins 
if kodak is unable to successfully negotiate raw material costs with its suppliers  or incurs adverse pricing on certain of its commodity based raw materials  reduction in the gross margins could occur 
additionally  delays in the company s execution of increasing manufacturing capabilities for certain of its products in some of its emerging markets  particularly china where it is more cost competitive  could adversely impact gross margins 
kodak s planned improvement in supply chain efficiency  if delayed  could adversely affect its business by preventing shipments of certain products to be made in their desired quantities and in a timely manner 
the planned efficiencies could be compromised if kodak expands into new markets with new applications that are not fully understood or if the portfolio broadens beyond that anticipated when the plans were initiated 
the unforeseen changes in manufacturing capacity could also compromise the supply chain efficiencies 
competition remains intense in the imaging sector in the photography  commercial and health segments 
on the photography side  price competition has been driven somewhat by consumers conservative spending behaviors during times of a weak world economy  international tensions and the accompanying concern over war and terrorism 
on the health and commercial side  aggressive pricing tactics intensified in the contract negotiations as competitors were vying for customers and market share domestically 
if the pricing and programs are not sufficiently competitive with those offered by kodak s current and future competitors  kodak may lose market share  adversely affecting its revenue and gross margins 
the impact of continuing customer consolidation and buying power could have an adverse impact on kodak s revenue  gross margins  and earnings 
in the competitive consumer retail environment  there is a movement from small individually owned retailers to larger and commonly known mass merchants 
in the commercial environment  there is a continuing consolidation of various group purchasing organizations 
the resellers and distributors may elect to use suppliers other than kodak 
kodak s challenge is to successfully negotiate contracts that provide the most favorable conditions to the company in the face of price and aggressive competitors 
kodak conducts business in developing markets with economies that tend to be more volatile than those in the united states and western europe 
the risk of doing business in developing markets like china  india  brazil  argentina  mexico  russia and other economically volatile areas could adversely affect kodak s operations and earnings 
such risks include the financial instability among customers in these regions  political instability and potential conflicts among developing nations and other non economic factors such as irregular trade flows that need to be managed successfully with the help of the local governments 
kodak s failure to successfully manage economic  political and other risks relating to doing business in developing countries and economically and politically volatile areas could adversely affect its business 
kodak  as a result of its global operating and financing activities  is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
exchange rates and interest rates in certain markets in which the company does business tend to be more volatile than those in the united states and western europe 
for example  in early  the united states dollar was eliminated as argentina s monetary benchmark  resulting in significant currency devaluation 
there can be no guarantees that the economic situation in developing markets or elsewhere will not worsen  which could result in future effects on earnings should such events occur

market price data price per share high low high low st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter summary of operating data a summary of operating data for and for the four years prior is shown on page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financing activities  is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and interest rates  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks associated with such activities  the company may enter into derivative contracts 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  especially those of the company s international treasury center  as well as forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany sales 
silver forward contracts are used to mitigate the company s risk to fluctuating silver prices 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates results from its investing and borrowing activities used to meet its liquidity needs 
long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments  while short term debt is used to meet working capital requirements 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
using a sensitivity analysis based on estimated fair value of open forward contracts using available forward rates  if the us dollar had been weaker at december  and  the fair value of open forward contracts would have increased million and million  respectively 
such gains or losses would be substantially offset by losses or gains from the revaluation or settlement of the underlying positions hedged 
using a sensitivity analysis based on estimated fair value of open forward contracts using available forward prices  if available forward silver prices had been lower at december  and  the fair value of open forward contracts would have decreased million and million  respectively 
such losses in fair value  if realized  would be offset by lower costs of manufacturing silver containing products 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities and  to a lesser extent  through investments in marketable securities 
the company may utilize borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of short term and long term borrowings are in fixed rate instruments 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings and marketable securities as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
using a sensitivity analysis based on estimated fair value of short term and long term borrowings  if available market interest rates had been about basis points higher at december   the fair value of short term and long term borrowings would have decreased million and million  respectively 
using a sensitivity analysis based on estimated fair value of short term and long term borrowings  if available market interest rates had been about basis points higher at december   the fair value of short term and long term borrowings would have decreased million and million  respectively 
the larger decrease in the fair value of long term borrowings in as compared with was entirely due to the increase in the amount of long term borrowings as a result of the october issuances of million of senior notes due and million of convertible senior notes due the company s financial instrument counterparties are high quality investment or commercial banks with significant experience with such instruments 
the company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by requiring specific minimum credit standards and diversification of counterparties 
the company has procedures to monitor the credit exposure amounts 
the maximum credit exposure at december  was not significant to the company
