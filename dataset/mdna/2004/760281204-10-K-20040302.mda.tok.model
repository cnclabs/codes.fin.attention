general business overview as of february   republic had banking centers in kentucky and two in southern indiana 
republic s two primary market areas are located in north central and central kentucky 
the north central kentucky market includes the louisville metropolitan area 
louisville  the largest city in kentucky  is the location of republic s headquarters and the location of banking centers 
republic s central kentucky market includes banking centers in the following kentucky cities bowling green  elizabethtown  frankfort  georgetown  lexington  the second largest city in kentucky  owensboro  and shelbyville 
republic bank trust company of indiana has offices located in new albany and clarksville  indiana 
republic plans to open one additional banking center in the southern indiana market during early republic has developed a community banking network  with most of its banking centers located either in separate communities or portions of urban areas that represent distinct communities 
each of republic s banking centers is managed by one or more officers with the authority to make loan decisions within company policies and guidelines 
republic continues to seek and evaluate additional expansion opportunities  either through the establishment of de novo banking centers and or through acquisitions of existing institutions in the financial services industry and ancillary non banking businesses 
the company intends to continue to consider various strategic acquisitions of banks  banking assets or financial services entities related to banking in those geographical areas that management believes would complement and increase republic s existing business lines  or expansion in new market areas or product lines that management determines would be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders 
republic s operating revenues are derived primarily from interest earned from its loan and investment securities portfolios and fee income from loan  deposit and other banking products 
the company has historically extended credit and provided general banking services through its banking center network to individuals  professionals and businesses 
over the past several years  the company has begun to seek new lines of business to diversify its asset mix and further enhance its profitability 
while each new line of business reflects the company s efforts to enrich its asset mix  each of these lines of business is an outgrowth of the basic community banking concepts in which the company has traditionally engaged 
the company principally markets its products and services through the following delivery channels mortgage lending the company utilizes its banking centers to offer a complete line of single family residential mortgage products 
the company generally retains mortgage loans with variable rates or adjustable rates or with up to year fixed rate terms 
prior to  the company typically sold its longer term fixed rate loans into the secondary market  however  over the past months republic retained some and year fixed rate loans as part of a specific program 
once closed  the secondary market loans are sold without recourse to institutional investors 
generally  fixed rate loans in process or held for sale are covered by forward commitments to these investors  thus limiting republic s interest rate risk 
during  republic began a practice of selling the majority of its fixed rate loans with the servicing retained by the company 
when administering loans with the servicing retained  the responsibility of collecting principal and interest payments  escrowing for taxes and insurance and remitting payments to the secondary market investors remains with republic 
a fee is received by republic for performing these standard servicing functions 
commercial lending commercial loans are primarily real estate secured and are generated at banking centers in the company s market areas 
the company makes commercial loans to a variety of industries and intends to expand this business through focused calling programs  seeking to broaden relationships by providing commercial clients with loan  deposit and cash management services 
preferred client services republic has established long standing relationships with the medical communities in its primary markets 
special loan and deposit products have been tailored to meet the needs of physicians and their practices 
consumer lending traditional consumer loans made by the company include automobile loans  home improvement and home equity loans  operating lines of credit and personal loans both secured and unsecured 
with the exception of home equity loans  which are actively marketed in conjunction with family first lien mortgage loans  traditional consumer loan products are not aggressively promoted in republic s markets 
specialized lending republic has pursued specialized lending opportunities to complement its traditional lending programs 
one specialized product line includes refund anticipation loans rals processed by refunds now  a program specializing in tax refund anticipation services 
additionally  the company also originates deferred deposit transactions  which are also commonly referred to as payday loans 
in a deferred deposit transaction  customers can receive cash advances in exchange for a check for the advanced amount plus a fixed fee 
see below sections titled refunds now and deferred deposit transactions for additional information 
internet banking republic continues to expand its market penetration and service delivery by offering clients internet banking services through republicbank 
com 
approximately of the bank s existing checking account clients utilize republic s internet banking services as of december  republicbank 
com is also available to clients outside of kentucky and has over million in deposits from states and the district of columbia as of december  other banking services the bank also provides investment management and trust services and engages in life  long term care and title insurance sales  item processing and other related financial institution lines of business 
at december   republic had approximately billion in trust assets under custody 
deposits are a key component to the company s banking business  serving as a source of funding for lending as well as a means for increasing client account relationships 
in addition  the company s overdraft program has become a significant source of fee revenue 
borrowings  principally from the federal home loan bank fhlb  and repurchase agreements  provide additional liquidity 
also  the company s investment securities  together with cash and cash equivalents  provide an important source of liquidity 
the company uses a majority of its investments as collateral for borrowings and to secure public fund deposits 
republic s operating revenues are derived primarily from interest earned from its loan and investment securities portfolios and fee income from loan  deposit and other banking products 
for information about republic s allowance for loan losses and the allocation of the allowance by loan type  see the discussion under the sub heading financial condition of republic s annual report to shareholders  which is incorporated herein by reference 
information about republic s business segments and non banking lines of business is contained in note of the consolidated financial statements included in republic s annual report to shareholders  which is incorporated herein by reference 
factors that may affect future results there are factors  many beyond our control  which may significantly change the results or expectations of the company 
some of these factors are described below  however  many are described in the sections that follow 
there are also other items  which are included in the annual report on form k for the year ended december  any factor described in this report or in the company s annual report on form k could  by itself or with other factors  adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there are also other factors not described in this report or in the annual report on form k which could cause our expectations to differ or could produce significantly different results 
industry factors general business and economic conditions can significantly impact the company s earnings 
general business and economic conditions in the united states of america and abroad can impact the company 
conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  monetary supply  and fluctuations in both debt and equity markets and the federal and state economies in which we operate 
economic factors such as a customer s loss of employment can limit the ability of the customer to repay principal and interest on their outstanding loan 
the company s earnings are significantly impacted by the fiscal and monetary polices of federal and state governments 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states of america 
its polices determine  in large part  our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments  all of which impact our net interest margin 
its policies can materially affect the value of our financial instruments and earnings and can also affect our borrowers and their ability to repay their loans 
republic s industry is highly competitive 
the company operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislation  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures 
federal legislation could also provide for changes in the banking laws that could impact the financial condition or results of operations of the company or its subsidiaries 
republic is heavily regulated by federal and state agencies 
the holding company and its subsidiary banks are heavily regulated at the federal and state levels 
the regulation is intended to protect the depositors  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not the shareholders of the company 
changes in policies  regulations and statutes could significantly impact the earnings or products that republic may deliver 
also  failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in significant penalties or sanctions by regulatory agencies 
the company relies on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by vendors  customers and other counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into transactions with other parties  the company relies on information furnished by or on behalf of customers or related entities to that customer 
our financial condition and earnings could be negatively impacted to the extent the company relies on information that is misleading or inaccurate 
company factors the holding company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenues 
republic bancorp  inc is a separate legal entity from its subsidiaries 
it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its largest subsidiary  republic bank trust company 
various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the holding company 
the company s accounting policies and estimates are key to how we present our financial statements 
republic s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
our management must exercise judgment in selecting and making various accounting policies and applying estimates 
actual outcomes can be materially different than amounts previously estimated 
management has identified two accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of the company s financial statements 
these polices are described below in the section titled critical accounting policies and relate to the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates  we cannot provide any assurance that the company will not significantly increase its allowance for loan losses if actual losses are more than the current amount reserved or recognize a significant provision for impairment of its mortgage servicing rights 
the company has lines of business or products other than banking 
in addition to traditional banking  ie customer loans and deposits  the company provides rals and electronic refund checks ercs  mortgage banking  overdraft honor and deferred deposit transactions 
management believes this diversity helps mitigate the company s exposure to significant downturns in any one segment of the banking industry  however  it also means that the company s earnings could be subject to different risks and uncertainties 
the following details specific risk factors related to republic s lines of business mortgage banking activities can be significantly impacted by interest rates 
changes in interest rates can impact gain on sale of loans  loan origination fees and loan servicing fees  which account for a significant portion of mortgage related revenues 
a decline in interest rates generally results in higher demand for mortgage products while an increase in rates generally results in a slow down in demand 
if demand increases  mortgage banking revenue will be positively impacted by more gains on sale  however  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights will decrease and may result in a significant impairment 
in addition to the previously mentioned risks  a decline in demand for mortgage banking products could also adversely impact other programs products in the bank such as  home equity lending  title insurance commissions and service charges on deposit accounts 
see below sections for additional discussion of mortgage banking activities 
deferred deposit transactions represent a significant business risk and if the company terminated the business it would materially impact earnings of the company 
deferred deposits are transactions whereby customers receive cash advances in exchange for a check for the advanced amount plus a fixed fee commonly referred to as a payday loan or payday lending 
various consumers groups have  from time to time  questioned the fairness of deferred deposit transactions and have accused this industry of charging excessive rates of interest via the fee and engaging in predatory lending practices 
both federal and state regulatory agencies have also questioned whether this business should be permitted by member banks 
there can be no assurance that the federal deposit insurance corporation or others will not impose additional limitations on or prohibit banks from engaging altogether in deferred deposit transactions 
there also can be no assurances that private litigation might not result from the program  or that the bank s ability to continue to engage in the business profitably or at all will not be negatively impacted by the requirements of applicable laws  regulations or guidelines 
the company exiting this business  either voluntary or involuntary would significantly reduce earnings 
rals represent a significant business risk and if the company terminated the business it would materially impact earnings of the company 
republic offers bank products to facilitate the electronic filing of tax returns by individuals across the country 
the company is one of only a few financial institutions in the united states of america that provides this service to potential taxpayers 
under this program  the taxpayer may receive a ral or an erc 
in return  the company charges a fee for service 
there is credit risk associated with a ral because the money is dispersed to the client before the bank receives the client s refund from the internal revenue service irs 
there is minimal credit risk with an erc because the bank does not disperse the funds to the client until the company has received the refund from the irs 
various consumers groups have  from time to time  questioned the fairness of the refunds now program and have accused this industry of charging excessive rates of interest via the fee and engaging in predatory lending practices 
pressure from these consumer groups could result in the company exiting this business at any time 
pressure from these consumer groups to the company s regulators could also cause republic to exit this line of business at any time 
exiting this line of business  either voluntarily or involuntarily  would significantly reduce earnings 
the company s overdraft honor program represents a significant business risk and if the company terminated the program it would materially impact earnings of the company 
republic s overdraft honor program permits selected clients to overdraft their accounts up to for the bank s customary fee 
customers checking accounts that have been current for a certain period of time are allowed the privilege to enter into the program 
this service is not considered extending credit and is considered providing the customer of the bank with a service of paying checks for a fee when sufficient funds are not available 
this fee  if computed as a percentage of the amount overdrawn  can sometimes result in an extremely high rate of interest and thus be considered excessive by some consumer groups 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fdic or others will not impose limitations on this program or that the bank s ability to engage in the product will not be negatively impacted by federal or other regulatory authorities 
the company eliminating this program  either voluntarily or involuntarily  would significantly reduce earning 
republic s stock price can be extremely volatile 
the company s stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors 
factors include  actual or anticipated variations in the company s quarterly operating results  recommendations by securities analysts  new technologies  operating and stock price performance of other companies  news reports and changes in government regulations  just to name a few 
the company also has a low average daily trading volume  which limits a person s ability to quickly accumulate or quickly divest themselves of republic s stock 
in addition  a low average daily trading volume can lead to large price swings based on a relatively few number of shares being traded 
employees as of december   the bank had full time equivalent employees 
altogether  republic had full time and part time employees 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and republic has never experienced a work stoppage 
competition the company actively competes with several local and regional commercial banks  thrifts  credit unions and mortgage companies for deposits  loans and other banking related financial services 
there is intense competition in the company s markets from other financial institutions as well as other non bank companies that engage in similar activities 
some of the company s competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulatory review and restrictions that apply to the company and the banks 
in addition  the company must compete with much larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources than the company and  while predominantly headquartered in other states  aggressively competes for market share in kentucky and southern indiana 
these competitors attempt to gain market share through their financial product mix  pricing strategies and banking center locations 
legislative developments related to interstate branching and banking in general  by providing large banking institutions easier access to a broader marketplace  are creating more pressure on smaller financial institutions to consolidate 
the company also competes with insurance companies  consumer finance companies  investment banking firms  brokerage houses  mutual fund managers and investment advisors  as federal law has made it easier for these companies to acquire banks and thus compete directly with the company 
retail establishments compete for loans by offering credit cards and retail installment contracts for the purchase of goods and merchandise 
it is anticipated that competition from both bank and non bank entities will continue to remain strong in the near future 
supervision and regulation republic and the banks are subject to the laws  regulations and policies of various regulatory authorities 
in particular  bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are affected by the credit and monetary policies and operational rules of the federal reserve board frb 
republic and the banks are also subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations affecting their business and must undergo periodic examination by federal and state financial institution examiners 
the operations and earnings of republic and the banks are affected not only by the laws and regulations applicable to the banking business  but also by the policies and interpretations of regulatory authorities 
the supervision and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors  the deposit insurance funds of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole  and not for the protection of bank holding company shareholders or creditors 
the banking agencies have broad enforcement powers over bank holding companies and banks  including the power to mandate particular actions or divestitures  impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations  to issue cease and desist or removal orders  to seek injunctions  to publicly disclose such actions and to police unsafe or unsound practices 
in addition  republic s non banking subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by other agencies 
for example  republic s non bank subsidiary engaged in insurance activities is subject to regulation by the kentucky department of insurance 
the following description summarizes some of the laws to which the company and the banks are subject 
the descriptions of applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries of such statutes and regulations  do not purport to be complete  and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations 
the company the company is a bank holding company that has elected and successfully maintained the status of a financial holding company under the bhca 
as such  it is subject to supervision  regulation and examination by the frb 
the bhca and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage  and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities  including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations 
financial holding company status also compels the company to maintain high capital ratios and management ratings with respect to its operations 
bank acquisitions by bank and financial holding companies republic is required to obtain the prior approval of the frb under the bhca before it may  among other things  acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank  if after such acquisition it would own or control  directly or indirectly more than of any class of the voting shares of such bank 
in approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies  the frb is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks involved  the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and various competitive factors 
consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy  which is discussed below 
consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties performance under the community reinvestment act of cra 
under the cra  all financial institutions have a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities  including low to moderate income neighborhoods 
under the bhca  so long as it is at least adequately capitalized and adequately managed  republic may purchase a bank located outside of kentucky or indiana 
similarly  an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company located outside of kentucky or indiana may purchase a bank located inside kentucky or indiana 
in each case  however  state law restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in specified concentrations of deposits 
for example  kentucky law prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of banks located in kentucky if the holding company would then hold more than of the total deposits of all federally insured depository institutions in kentucky 
financial activities the activities permissible to bank holding companies and their affiliates were substantially expanded by the gramm leach bliley act glba  effective march  the glba permits bank holding companies to qualify as financial holding companies that may engage in a broad range of financial activities  including underwriting  dealing in and making a market in securities  insurance underwriting and agency activities without geographic or other limitation  and merchant banking 
republic elected and maintained its status as a financial holding company and  as such  it may engage in financial activities activities that are financial in nature  such as insurance and securities underwriting and dealing activities and activities the frb determines to be complementary to financial activities which do not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
the relevant federal bank regulators have adopted regulations identifying certain activities as financial in nature or incidental to financial activities  as well as the procedures that allow a financial holding company to request the frb s approval to conduct an activity that is complementary to a financial activity 
a financial holding company generally is not required to obtain prior frb approval in order to engage in the financial activities identified in the glba or the frb regulations 
however  a financial holding company cannot commence or acquire any new financial activities if one of its depository institution subsidiaries receives a less than satisfactory cra rating 
in addition  if any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases being well capitalized or well managed  and compliance is not achieved within days  a financial holding company may be forced  in effect  to cease conducting business as a financial holding company by divesting either its non banking financial activities or its banks 
moreover  hart scott rodino antitrust filing requirements may apply to certain non bank acquisitions 
subject to certain exceptions  insured state banks are permitted to control or hold an interest in a financial subsidiary that engages in a broader range of activities such as securities underwriting than are permissible for national banks to engage in directly  subject to any restrictions imposed on a bank under the laws of the state under which it is organized 
conducting financial activities through a bank subsidiary can impact capital adequacy and restrictions will apply to affiliate transactions between the bank and its financial subsidiary 
safe and sound banking practice bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices 
the fdic  the kentucky department of financial institutions and the indiana department of financial institutions have similar authority with respect to republic s bank subsidiaries 
source of strength under frb policy  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries and to commit resources to their support 
such support may restrict the company s ability to pay dividends  and may be required at times when  absent this frb policy  a holding company may not be inclined to provide it 
as noted below  a bank holding company may also be required to guarantee the capital restoration plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary and cross guarantee provisions described below apply to the company 
the banks republic bank trust company is a kentucky chartered commercial banking corporation  the deposits of which are insured by the fdic 
as such  it is subject to supervision and regulation by the fdic and the kentucky department of financial institutions 
republic bank trust company of indiana is an indiana chartered commercial banking corporation  the deposits of which are insured by the fdic 
as such  it is subject to supervision and regulation by the fdic and the indiana department of financial institutions 
such supervision and regulation subjects the banks to special restrictions  requirements  potential enforcement actions and periodic examination by the fdic and the respective departments of financial institutions of kentucky and indiana 
because the frb regulates the bank holding company parent of the banks  the frb also has supervisory authority that directly affects the banks 
the kentucky and indiana banking statutes prescribe the permissible activities in which a kentucky or indiana bank may engage and where those activities may be conducted 
kentucky s statutes contain a super parity provision that permits a well rated kentucky banking corporation such as republic bank trust company to engage in any banking activity in which a national or state bank operating in any other state or a federal savings association meeting the qualified thrift lender test and operating in any state could engage  provided it first obtains a legal opinion from counsel specifying the statutory or regulatory provisions that permit the activity 
branching kentucky law permits a kentucky chartered bank to establish a branch office in any county in kentucky 
a kentucky bank may also establish a branch office outside of kentucky 
well capitalized kentucky banks that have been in operation at least three years and that satisfy certain criteria relating to  among other things  their composite and management ratings  may establish a branch in kentucky without the approval of the commissioner of the kentucky department of financial institutions upon notice to the department and any other state bank with its main office located in the county where the new branch will be located 
branching by all other banks requires the approval of the commissioner  who must ascertain and determine that the public convenience and advantage will be served and promoted and that there is reasonable probability of the successful operation of the branch 
in any case  the transaction must also be approved by the fdic  which considers a number of factors  including financial history  capital adequacy  earnings prospects  character of management  needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers 
an out of state bank is permitted to establish branch offices in kentucky only by merging with a kentucky bank 
de novo branching into kentucky by an out of state bank is not permitted 
this difficulty for out of state banks to branch into kentucky may limit the ability of a kentucky bank to branch into many states  as several states have reciprocity requirements for interstate branching 
under indiana law  an indiana chartered bank may branch statewide and may establish and maintain a de novo branch or acquire a branch in a state other than indiana  with the approval or consent of indiana and the desired state s authorities 
an out of state bank may establish and maintain a de novo branch in indiana and may establish and maintain a branch in indiana through the acquisition of a branch  subject to the prior approval of the bank s primary regulator and upon notice to the indiana department of financial institutions 
restrictions on affiliate transactions transactions between the bank and its non banking affiliates  including the company  are subject to section a of the federal reserve act 
in general  section a imposes limits on the amount of such transactions  and also requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties 
it also limits the amount of advances to third parties  which are collateralized by the securities  or obligations of the company or its subsidiaries 
affiliate transactions are also subject to section b of the federal reserve act which generally requires that certain transactions between the bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with the banks and other nonaffiliated persons 
the frb promulgated regulation w to implement sections a and b 
that regulation contains the foregoing restrictions and also addresses derivative transactions  overdraft facilities and other transactions between a bank and its non bank affiliates 
restrictions on distribution of subsidiary bank dividends and assets dividends paid by the bank have provided substantially all of the company s operating funds  and that is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
capital adequacy requirements and state law serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank 
under federal law  the bank cannot pay a dividend if  after paying the dividend  the bank will be undercapitalized 
the frb or the fdic may declare a dividend payment to be unsafe and unsound even though the bank would continue to meet its capital requirements after the dividend 
under kentucky banking law  the dividends the bank can pay during any calendar year are generally limited to its profits for that year  plus its retained net profits for the two preceding years  less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock or debt  absent approval of the commissioner of the kentucky department of financial institutions 
indiana banking laws prohibit the payment of dividends to the company by republic bank trust company of indiana for a period of three years after it commenced operations  or may  without prior approval of the indiana department of financial institutions 
because the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries  its right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution  the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its shareholders  including any depository institution holding company such as the company or any shareholder or creditor thereof 
deposit insurance assessments currently  the fdic maintains two funds for the insurance of deposits of financial institutions the bank insurance fund bif for deposits originated by banks including the bank and the savings association insurance fund saif for deposits originated by savings associations  including savings association deposits acquired by banks 
the banks must pay assessments to the fdic for federal deposit insurance protection based on a risk based assessment system 
under this system  fdic insured depository institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification 
institutions assigned to higher risk classifications that is  institutions that pose a greater risk of loss to their respective deposit insurance funds pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk 
an institution s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators 
in addition  the fdic can impose special assessments in certain instances 
the current range of bif and saif assessments is between and of deposits 
the deposit insurance funds act of requires both bif and saif insured institutions to share the cost of the financing corporation bonds  which were issued to initially fund the saif  through additional assessments on insured deposits 
financing corporation assessments imposed on bif insured deposits are presently estimated at basis points 
cross guarantee provisions the federal deposit insurance act contains a cross guarantee provision which generally makes commonly controlled insured depository institutions liable to the fdic for any losses incurred in connection with the failure of its sister depository institution 
consumer laws and regulations in addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein  the banks are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth herein is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the fair housing act and the fair and accurate transactions act  among others 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients when taking deposits or making loans 
these laws also limit the banks ability to share information with affiliated and unaffiliated entities 
the banks must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing business operations 
various consumers groups have  from time to time  questioned the fairness of deferred deposit transactions and refund anticipation loans  both products provided by the company 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion regarding these products under the headings deferred deposit transactions and refunds now 
capital adequacy requirements capital guidelines the frb and the fdic have substantially similar risk based and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations  which are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital related to the risk levels of assets and off balance sheet instruments 
under the risk based guidelines  specific categories of assets are assigned different risk weights  based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset 
these risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
the guidelines require a minimum total risk based capital ratio of  of which at least is required to consist of tier i capital elements generally  common shareholders equity  minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
total capital is the sum of tier i and tier ii capital 
tier ii capital generally may consist of limited amounts of subordinated debt  qualifying hybrid capital instruments  other preferred stock  loan loss reserves and unrealized gains on certain equity securities 
as of december   the company s ratio of tier i capital to total risk weighted assets was and its ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets was 
as of december   republic bank trust company s ratio of tier i capital to total risk weighted assets was and its ratio of total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets was 
republic bank trust company of indiana s tier i capital to total risk weighted assets was and its ratio of total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets was at december  in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the frb uses a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies 
the leverage ratio is a company s tier i capital divided by its average total consolidated assets less goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
certain highly rated bank holding companies may maintain a minimum leverage ratio of  but other bank holding companies may be required to maintain a leverage ratio of up to basis points above the regulatory minimum 
as of december   the company s leverage ratio was 
the fdic s leverage guidelines require state banks to maintain tier i capital of no less than of average total assets  except in the case of certain highly rated banks for which the requirement is of average total assets 
as of december   republic bank trust company s and republic bank trust company of indiana s leverage ratios were and as of december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in republic s annual report to shareholders 
the federal banking agencies risk based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria  assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating 
banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios 
the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant 
frb guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
the fdic may establish higher minimum capital adequacy requirements if  for example  a bank has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk 
corrective measures for capital deficiencies the federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to capital deficient institutions 
agency regulations define  for each capital category  the levels at which institutions are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
under these regulations  a well capitalized bank has a total risk based capital ratio of or higher  a tier i risk based capital ratio of or higher  a leverage ratio of or higher  and is not subject to any written agreement  order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
an adequately capitalized bank has a total risk based capital ratio of or higher  a tier i risk based capital ratio of or higher  a leverage ratio of or higher or higher if the bank was rated a camel in its most recent examination report and is not experiencing significant growth  and does not meet the criteria for a well capitalized bank 
a bank is undercapitalized if it fails to meet any one of the ratios required to be adequately capitalized 
undercapitalized institutions are required to submit a capital restoration plan  which must be guaranteed by any holding company of the institution 
in addition  agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth  acquisitions  branch establishment  and expansion into new lines of business 
with certain exceptions  an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions  including dividends and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment 
a bank s capital classification will also affect its ability to accept brokered deposits 
under the fdic regulations  a bank may not lawfully accept  roll over or renew brokered deposits unless either it is well capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic 
if a banking institution s capital decreases below acceptable levels  the fdic s enforcement powers become more enhanced 
a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to mandated capital raising activities  restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates  removal of management  and other restrictions 
the fdic has only very limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and is virtually required to appoint a receiver or conservator 
banks with risk based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions  including the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing  or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing in the event the institution has no tangible capital 
in addition  a bank holding company that elects to be treated as an fhc may face significant consequences if its banks fail to maintain the required capital and management ratings  including entering into an agreement with the frb which imposes limitations on its operations and may even require divestitures 
such possible ramifications may limit the ability of a bank subsidiary to significantly expand or acquire less than well capitalized and well managed institutions 
more specifically  the frb s regulations require a financial holding company to notify the frb within days of becoming aware that any depository institution controlled by the company has ceased to become well capitalized or well managed 
if the frb determines that a financial holding company controls a depository institution that is not well capitalized or well managed  the frb will notify the fhc that it is not in compliance with applicable requirements and require the fhc to enter into an agreement acceptable to the frb to correct any deficiencies 
until such deficiencies are corrected  the frb may impose any limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the fhc and its affiliates that the frb determines are appropriate  and the fhc may not commence any additional activity or acquire control of any company under section k of the bhc act without prior frb approval 
unless the period of time for compliance is extended by the frb  if an fhc fails to correct deficiencies in maintaining its qualification for fhc status within days of entering into an agreement with the frb  the frb may order divestiture of any depository institution controlled by the company 
a company may comply with a divestiture order by ceasing to engage in any financial or other activity that would not be permissible for a bank holding company that has not elected to be treated as an fhc 
legislative initiatives the united states congress and state legislative bodies continually consider proposals for altering the structure  regulation  and competitive relationships of financial institutions 
it cannot be predicted whether  or in what form  any of these potential proposals or regulatory initiatives will be adopted  the impact they will have on the financial institutions industry or the extent to which the business or financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries may be affected

republic  a bank holding company headquartered in louisville  kentucky  is the parent of republic bank trust company  republic bank trust company of indiana collectively bank and republic funding company 
this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information 
this discussion includes various forward looking statements with respect to credit quality including but not limited to delinquency trends and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  corporate objectives  the company s interest rate sensitivity model and other financial and business matters 
broadly speaking  forward looking statements include projections of the company s revenues  income  earnings per share  capital expenditures  dividends  capital structure or other financial items  descriptions of plans or objectives of the company s management for future operations  products or services  forecasts of republic s future economic performance  and descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing 
the company may make forward looking statements discussing management s expectations about future credit losses and non performing assets  the future value of mortgage servicing rights  the impact of new accounting standards  future short term and long term interest rate levels and their impact on republic s net interest margin  net income  liquidity and capital  and future capital expenditures 
forward looking statements discuss matters that are not historical facts 
because they discuss future events or conditions  forward looking statements often include words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  target  can  could  may  should  will  would  or similar expressions 
do not unduly rely on forward looking statements 
they detail management s expectations about the future and are not guarantees 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and management may not update them to reflect changes that occur after the date the statements are made 
there are several factors  many beyond management s control  that could cause results to differ significantly from management s expectations 
these factors include  among other things  industry factors and company factors 
company overview as of december   republic had a total of banking centers in kentucky communities and two in southern indiana 
republic s two primary market areas are located in north central and central kentucky 
the north central kentucky market includes the louisville metropolitan area 
louisville  the largest city in kentucky  is the location of republic s headquarters and the location of banking centers at december  republic s central kentucky market includes banking centers in the following kentucky cities bowling green  elizabethtown  frankfort  lexington  the second largest city in kentucky  owensboro  and shelbyville at december  republic bank trust company of indiana has offices located in new albany and clarksville  indiana 
republic has also announced plans to open one additional banking center in its louisville market and one in both the southern indiana and georgetown  kentucky markets during early republic has developed a community banking network  with most of its banking centers located either in separate communities or portions of urban areas that represent distinct communities 
each of republic s banking centers is managed by one or more officers with the authority to make loan decisions within company policies and guidelines 
republic continues to seek and evaluate additional expansion opportunities  either through the establishment of de novo banking centers and or through acquisitions of existing institutions in the financial services industry and ancillary non banking businesses 
the company intends to continue to consider various strategic acquisitions of banks  banking assets or financial services entities related to banking in those geographical areas that management believes would complement and increase republic s existing business lines  or expansion in new market areas or product lines that management determines would be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders 
republic s operating revenues are derived primarily from interest earned from its loan and investment securities portfolios and fee income from loan  deposit and other banking products 
the company has historically extended credit and provided general banking services through its banking center network to individuals  professionals and businesses 
over the past several years  the company has begun to seek new lines of business to diversify its asset mix and further enhance its profitability 
while each new line of business reflects the company s efforts to enrich its asset mix  each of these lines of business is an outgrowth of the basic community banking concepts in which the company has traditionally engaged 
the company principally markets its products and services through the following delivery channels mortgage lending the company utilizes its banking centers to offer a complete line of single family residential mortgage products 
the company generally retains mortgage loans with variable rates or adjustable rates or with up to year fixed rate terms 
prior to  the company typically sold its longer term fixed rate loans into the secondary market  however  over the past months republic retained some and year fixed rate loans as part of a specific program 
once closed  the secondary market loans are sold without recourse to institutional investors 
generally  fixed rate loans in process or held for sale are covered by forward commitments to these investors  thus limiting republic s interest rate risk 
during  republic began a practice of selling the majority of its fixed rate loans with the servicing retained by the company 
when administering loans with the servicing retained  the responsibility of collecting principal and interest payments  escrowing for taxes and insurance and remitting payments to the secondary market investors remains with republic 
a fee is received by republic for performing these standard servicing functions 
commercial lending commercial loans are primarily real estate secured and are generated at banking centers in the company s market areas 
the company makes commercial loans to a variety of industries and intends to expand this business through focused calling programs  seeking to broaden relationships by providing commercial clients with loan  deposit and cash management services 
preferred client services republic has established long standing relationships with the medical communities in its primary markets 
special loan and deposit products have been tailored to meet the needs of physicians and their practices 
consumer lending traditional consumer loans made by the company include automobile loans  home improvement and home equity loans  operating lines of credit and personal loans both secured and unsecured 
with the exception of home equity loans  which are actively marketed in conjunction with family first lien mortgage loans  traditional consumer loan products are not aggressively promoted in republic s markets 
specialized lending republic has pursued specialized lending opportunities to complement its traditional lending programs 
one specialized product line includes refund anticipation loans rals checks processed by refunds now  a program specializing in tax refund anticipation services 
additionally  the company also originates deferred deposit transactions  which are also commonly referred to as payday loans 
in a deferred deposit transaction  customers can receive cash advances in exchange for a check for the advanced amount plus a fixed fee 
see below sections titled refunds now and deferred deposit transactions for additional information 
internet banking republic continues to expand its market penetration and service delivery by offering clients internet banking services through republicbank 
com 
approximately of the bank s existing checking account clients utilize republic s internet banking services as of december  republicbank 
com is also available to clients outside of kentucky and has over million in deposits from states and the district of columbia as of december  other banking services the bank also provides investment management and trust services and engages in life  long term care and title insurance sales  item processing and other related financial institution lines of business 
at december   republic had approximately billion in trust assets under custody 
factors that may affect future results there are factors  many beyond our control  which may significantly change the results or expectations of the company 
some of these factors are described below  however  many are described in the sections that follow 
there are also other items  which are included in the annual report on form k for the year ended december  any factor described in this report or in the company s annual report on form k could  by itself or with other factors  adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there are also other factors not described in this report or in the annual report on form k which could cause our expectations to differ or could produce significantly different results 
industry factors general business and economic conditions can significantly impact the company s earnings 
general business and economic conditions in the united states of america and abroad can impact the company 
conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  monetary supply  fluctuations in both debt and equity markets and the federal and state economies in which we operate 
economic factors such as a customer s loss of employment can limit the ability of the customer to repay principal and interest on their outstanding loan 
the company s earnings are significantly impacted by the fiscal and monetary polices of federal and state governments 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states of america 
its polices determine  in large part  our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments  all of which impact our net interest margin 
its policies can materially affect the value of our financial instruments and earnings and can also affect our borrowers and their ability to repay their loans 
republic s industry is highly competitive 
the company operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislation  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures 
federal legislation could also provide for changes in the banking laws that could impact the financial condition or results of operations of the company or its subsidiaries 
republic is heavily regulated by federal and state agencies 
the holding company and its subsidiary banks are heavily regulated at the federal and state levels 
the regulation is intended to protect the depositors  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not the shareholders of the company 
changes in policies  regulations and statutes could significantly impact the earnings or products that republic may deliver 
also  failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in significant penalties or sanctions by regulatory agencies 
the company relies on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by vendors  customers and other counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into transactions with other parties  the company relies on information furnished by or on behalf of customers or related entities to that customer 
our financial condition and earnings could be negatively impacted to the extent the company relies on information that is misleading or inaccurate 
company factors the holding company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenues 
republic bancorp  inc is a separate legal entity from its subsidiaries 
it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its largest subsidiary  republic bank trust company 
various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the holding company 
the company s accounting policies and estimates are key to how we present our financial statements 
republic s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
our management must exercise judgment in selecting and making various accounting policies and applying estimates 
actual outcomes can be materially different than amounts previously estimated 
management has identified two accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of the company s financial statements 
these polices are described below in the section titled critical accounting policies and relate to the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates  we cannot provide any assurance that the company will not significantly increase its allowance for loan losses if actual losses are more than the current amount reserved or recognize a significant provision for impairment of its mortgage servicing rights 
the company has lines of business or products other than banking 
in addition to traditional banking  ie customer loans and deposits  the company provides rals and ercs  mortgage banking  overdraft honor and deferred deposit transactions 
management believes this diversity helps mitigate the company s exposure to significant downturns in any one segment of the banking industry  however  it also means that the company s earnings could be subject to different risks and uncertainties 
the following details specific risk factors related to republic s lines of business mortgage banking activities can be significantly impacted by interest rates 
changes in interest rates can impact gain on sale of loans  loan origination fees and loan servicing fees  which account for a significant portion of mortgage related revenues 
a decline in interest rates generally results in higher demand for mortgage products while an increase in rates generally results in a slow down in demand 
if demand increases  mortgage banking revenue will be positively impacted by more gains on sale  however  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights will decrease and may result in a significant impairment 
in addition to the previously mentioned risks  a decline in demand for mortgage banking products could also adversely impact other programs products in the bank such as  home equity lending  title insurance commissions and service charges on deposit accounts 
see below sections for additional discussion of mortgage banking activities 
deferred deposit transactions represent a significant business risk and if the company terminated the business it would materially impact earnings of the company 
deferred deposits are transactions whereby customers receive cash advances in exchange for a check for the advanced amount plus a fixed fee commonly referred to as a payday loan or payday lending 
various consumers groups have  from time to time  questioned the fairness of deferred deposit transactions and have accused this industry of charging excessive rates of interest via the fee and engaging in predatory lending practices 
both federal and state regulatory agencies have also questioned whether this business should be permitted by member banks 
there can be no assurance that the federal deposit insurance corporation or others will not impose additional limitations on or prohibit banks from engaging altogether in deferred deposit transactions 
there also can be no assurances that private litigation might not result from the program  or that the bank s ability to continue to engage in the business profitably or at all will not be negatively impacted by the requirements of applicable laws  regulations or guidelines 
the company exiting this business  either voluntary or involuntary would significantly reduce earnings 
see additional discussion about this product in a separate section titled deferred deposit transactions below 
rals represent a significant business risk and if the company terminated the business it would materially impact earnings of the company 
republic offers bank products to facilitate the electronic filing of tax returns by individuals across the country 
the company is one of only a few financial institutions in the united states o of america that provides this service to potential taxpayers 
under this program  the taxpayer may receive a ral or an erc 
in return  the company charges a fee for service 
there is credit risk associated with a ral because the money is dispersed to the client before the bank receives the client s refund from the internal revenue service irs 
there is minimal credit risk with an erc because the bank does not disperse the funds to the client until the company has received the refund from the irs 
various consumers groups have  from time to time  questioned the fairness of the refunds now program and have accused this industry of charging excessive rates of interest via the fee and engaging in predatory lending practices 
pressure from these consumer groups could result in the company exiting this business at any time 
pressure from these consumer groups to the company s regulators could also cause republic to exit this line of business at any time 
exiting this line of business  either voluntarily or involuntarily  would significantly reduce earnings 
see additional discussion about this product in section titled refunds now below 
the company s overdraft honor program represents a significant business risk and if the company terminated the program it would materially impact earnings of the company 
republic s overdraft honor program permits selected clients to overdraft their accounts up to for the bank s customary fee 
customers checking accounts that have been current for a certain period of time are allowed the privilege to enter into the program 
this service is not considered extending credit and is considered providing the customer of the bank with a service of paying checks for a fee when sufficient funds are not available 
this fee  if computed as a percentage of the amount overdrawn  can sometimes result in an extremely high rate of interest and thus be considered excessive by some consumer groups 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fdic or others will not impose limitations on this program or that the bank s ability to engage in the product will not be negatively impacted by federal or other regulatory authorities 
the company eliminating this program  either voluntarily or involuntarily  would significantly reduce earning 
republic s stock price can be extremely volatile 
the company s stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors 
factors include  actual or anticipated variations in the company s quarterly operating results  recommendations by securities analysts  new technologies  operating and stock price performance of other companies  news reports and changes in government regulations  just to name a few 
the company also has a low average daily trading volume  which limits a person s ability to quickly accumulate or quickly divest themselves of republic s stock 
in addition  a low average daily trading volume can lead to large price swings based on a relatively few number of shares being traded 
highlights net income for was million  representing an increase of million over diluted earnings per class a common stock increased for the year to 
republic s rise in earnings was primarily due to increased net interest income including deferred deposit transactions  gain on sale of mortgage loans  service charges on deposit accounts and increased earnings at refunds now as described below 
following is a brief description of a few company highlights during republic s total assets surpassed billion during the year ending with billion in total assets 
as of december   republic was the second largest independently owned  kentucky based bank holding company 
net interest income grew during the year as the company continued to benefit from a decline in short term market interest rates combined with growth in the loan portfolio  particularly in residential real estate loans  deferred deposit transactions and rals 
the company continued a program in of retaining fixed rate residential real estate loans and funding the loans with long term federal home loan bank fhlb advances and brokered cds with laddered maturities while achieving an approximate spread of 
republic reported another strong year in its mortgage banking operations as favorable long term market interest rates  coupled with the company s promotion of its maximum closing cost product  led to strong gains on the sale of family  fixed rate residential real estate loans into the secondary market 
altogether  the company sold over million in secondary market loans during refunds now reported record earnings during due to a substantial increase in transaction volume related to new sales and a shift in product mix to more ral products 
overall  the number of tax preparers serviced by refunds now during increased over to  tax offices 
republic opened six new banking centers during with three additional locations under construction that are scheduled to open early in service charges on deposit accounts increased significantly during the year as the company s checking accounts grew by nearly  accounts 
a large number of these new accounts were added in conjunction with the company s promotion of its maximum closing cost  fixed rate mortgage product  which requires a primary checking account to receive the favorable fixed closing cost 
service charges on deposit accounts also benefited from accounts opened at republic s six new banking centers during and from the growth in the number of accounts eligible for the company s overdraft honor program 
loans increased million or as republic retained approximately million in fixed rate residential real estate loans  which the company traditionally sold into the secondary market 
republic also achieved a million increase in home equity loans outstanding as the company added over  new home equity lines of credit during these new lines of credit primarily originated from cross selling opportunities created in conjunction with the company s mortgage product 
the company grew its deferred deposit transactions outstanding to million at december  republic reported net income during of million compared to million for  an increase of 
diluted earnings per class a common stock shares increased to for the year ended december  on a percentage basis  the increase in diluted earnings per class a common stock increased less than net income primarily due to the conversion of republic s guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the company s subordinated debentures 
the rise in earnings for was primarily attributable to increased net interest income  increased income associated with refunds now  gains on the sale of loans into the secondary market and service charges on deposits 
republic s book value increased from at december  to per share at december  the following table summarizes selected financial information regarding republic s financial performance table summary years ended december  dollars in thousands net income diluted earnings per class a common stock return on average assets roa return on average equity roe critical accounting policies and estimates republic s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods 
management continually evaluates the company s accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from regulators and third party professionals and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
critical accounting policies are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates have a significant impact on the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available pricing  sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative methods of accounting may be utilized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management has discussed the identification and determination of critical accounting policies with the company s audit committee 
republic believes its critical accounting policies and estimates include the valuation of the allowance for loan losses and mortgage servicing rights 
allowance for loan losses republic maintains an allowance for probable credit losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and regularly presents and discusses the analysis with the audit committee and the board of directors 
management estimates the allowance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower capacity  estimated collateral values  economic conditions  regulatory requirements and guidance and other factors 
while management estimates the allowance for loan losses  in part  based on historical losses within each loan category  estimates for losses within the commercial real estate portfolio are more dependent upon credit analysis and recent payment performance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that may be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance at the point when management deems a loan uncollectible 
management makes allocations within the allowance for specifically classified loans regardless of loan amount  collateral or loan type 
loans that are past due days or more and that are not specifically classified are uniformly assigned a risk weighted percentage ranging from to of the loan balance based upon loan type 
management evaluates the remaining loan portfolio by utilizing the historical loss rate for each respective loan type 
both an average five year loss rate and a loss rate based on heavier weighting of the previous two years loss experience are utilized in the analysis 
specialized loan categories are evaluated by utilizing subjective factors in addition to a historical loss calculation to determine a loss allocation for each of those types 
because this analysis or any similar analysis is an imprecise measure of loss  the allowance is subject to ongoing adjustments 
therefore  management will also take into account other significant factors as may be necessary or prudent in order to reflect probable incurred losses in the total loan portfolio 
based on management s calculation  an allowance of million or of total loans was an adequate estimate of losses within the loan portfolio as of december  this estimate resulted in a provision for loan losses on the income statement of million during if the mix and amount of future charge off percentages differ significantly from those assumptions used by management in making its determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on the income statement could be materially affected 
mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights msrs represent an estimate of the present value of future cash servicing income  net of estimated costs that republic expects to receive on loans sold with servicing retained by the company 
msrs are capitalized as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained 
this transaction is posted to net gain on sale of loans  a component of mortgage banking income 
the carrying value of msrs is amortized in proportion to and over the period of  net servicing income 
the amortization is recorded as a reduction to mortgage banking income 
the total msr asset  net of amortization  recorded at december  is million 
the carrying value of the msrs asset is periodically reviewed for impairment based on the fair value of the msrs  using groupings of the underlying loans by interest rates and by geography and prepayment characteristics 
any impairment of a grouping would need to be reported as a valuation allowance 
a primary factor influencing the fair value is the estimated life of the underlying loans serviced 
the estimated life of the loans serviced is significantly influenced by market interest rates 
during a period of declining interest rates  the fair value of the msrs should decline due to expected prepayments within the portfolio 
alternatively  during a period of rising interest rates the fair value of msrs should increase as prepayments on the underlying loans would be expected to decline 
management utilizes an independent third party on a quarterly basis to assist with the fair value estimate of the msrs 
based on the estimated fair value at december  and  management determined no impairment of these assets existed 
on an ongoing basis  management considers all relevant factors  in addition to pricing considerations from other servicers  to estimate the fair value of the msrs to be recorded when the loans are initially sold with servicing retained by the company 
deferred deposit transactions deferred deposits are transactions whereby customers typically receive cash advances in exchange for a check for the advanced amount plus a fixed fee commonly referred to as a payday loan or payday lending 
republic agrees to delay presentment of the check for payment until the advance due date  typically to days from the cash advance date 
on or before the advance due date  the customer can redeem his or her check in cash for the amount of the advance plus the fee 
if the customer does not reclaim the check in cash by the advance due date  the check is deposited 
based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  these transactions are recorded as loans on the company s financial statements and the corresponding fees are recorded as a component of interest income on loans 
the company has been conducting a deferred deposit transaction business  in conjunction with third party marketer servicers since august in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into contracts with two third party marketer servicers in order to increase its deferred deposit transaction business 
during  the company further expanded its relationship with one of its marketer servicers that contributed to a substantial increase in deferred deposit transactions 
total outstandings were million at december  compared to million at december  management anticipates deferred deposit transactions outstanding will decrease by the end of the first quarter of due to seasonality  but does not believe the decrease will exceed of deferred deposit outstandings at december  fdic guidance issued in july requires that banks limit deferred deposit transaction outstandings to the lesser of of tier i capital or the amount that actual capital levels exceed the well capitalized classification for tier i and total capital 
based on the bank s capital levels at year end  deferred deposit transaction outstandings were well below the bank s regulatory limit of million 
the marketer servicers with which the company does business have at times experienced legal and or regulatory obstacles in some states in which they do business 
in these states  laws have been enacted or amended to prohibit or limit their ability to conduct business without a financial institution partner 
in addition  the comptroller of the currency has effectively prohibited national banks from conducting this business 
this has provided opportunities for certain state chartered commercial banks to enter the business and increase earnings with acceptable capital outlays 
the legal and regulatory climate for this product also continues to change 
the fdic s final guidance issued in july characterizes deferred deposit transactions as presenting substantial credit risks for lenders  because among other things  the loans are unsecured and the borrower generally has limited financial resources as well as increased transaction  legal and reputation risks when a third party arrangement is used 
this guidance proposes  among other items  that banks hold significantly more capital than would be required for other sub prime type loans  suggesting required capital of as much as of deferred deposit transactions outstanding 
the guidance also requires that the allowance for loan and lease losses be adequate and take into account that many such transactions remain outstanding beyond their initial term due to renewals and rollovers  that deferred deposit transactions be classified substandard  and that transactions outstanding for more than days generally be classified as loss 
the guidance also prescribes limits on the ability of a borrower to renew or rollover a deferred deposit transaction and on the number of transactions that can be entered into with an individual customer within a given period of time 
the guidance requires examiners to assess the bank s risk management program for third party marketing and servicing relationships  including the bank s due diligence process for selecting third party marketing and servicing providers and its monitoring of the third party s activities and performance 
banks are also advised to carefully evaluate compliance with consumer protection laws and applicable regulations 
the company believes that it has adequately considered and addressed the risks associated with its deferred deposit transaction business  including the risks discussed in the fdic guidelines and that the company s size  technological resources and experience in the successful management of non traditional product lines  among other factors  will enable the company to effectively manage and control its participation in the deferred deposit transaction business 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fdic or others will not impose additional limitations on or prohibit banks from engaging altogether in deferred deposit transactions  that private litigation might not result from the program  or that the bank s ability to continue to engage in the business profitably or at all will not be negatively impacted by the requirements of applicable laws  regulations or guidelines 
refunds now refunds now is a tax refund processing service for taxpayers receiving both federal and state tax refunds through tax preparers located nationwide 
rals are made to taxpayers filing income tax returns electronically 
the rals are repaid by the taxpayer when the taxpayer s refunds are electronically received by the bank from governmental taxing authorities 
refunds now also provides ercs and electronic refund deposits erds to taxpayers 
after receiving refunds electronically from governmental taxing authorities  a check or a direct payment to the taxpayer s account is issued for the amount of the refund  less fees 
for  refunds now generated million in ral fees  compared to  for the same period in refunds now also received million in erc fees during  compared to million during the total volume of tax return refunds processed during the tax season was billion approximately million in rals and million in ercs  a increase over the volume processed for the tax season 
internal analysis of government tax refund payments to recipients not approved for a ral during the tax season resulted in an increase in the number of ral applications approved during the tax season 
this resulted in a shift in product mix toward the ral product 
in addition  the total number of tax preparers served by refunds now during increased over overall  ral volume increased during compared to while erc volume rose for the same period 
results of operations net interest income the principal source of republic s revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is impacted by both changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as market interest rates 
for  net interest income was million  up million over the company was able to increase its net interest income primarily through increased loan volume and a reduction in the company s cost of funds 
fees from deferred deposit transactions  which increased over the million recognized during and fees from rals  which increased million over the million recognized during  were major components of the overall increase for the company also experienced an increase in net interest income as a result of growth in the loan portfolio resulting primarily from the retention of nearly million in fixed rate residential real estate loans since october overall  the company s net interest spread and net interest margin were higher in compared to the increase in spread and margin resulted from a sharp decrease in cost of funds without a corresponding decrease in yield on interest earning assets 
republic was able to minimize the decrease in its yield on interest earning assets primarily through increased fees from deferred deposit transactions and rals 
while the company believes that these fees will continue for the foreseeable future  as stated above  there is regulatory risk and other risk inherent in these sources of income which could limit their future availability 
during  the company also began to experience compression of its net interest spread and margin 
this resulted primarily from the million in residential real estate loans that were retained and funded by fixed rate fhlb borrowings and brokered deposits achieving a spread of approximately 
net interest spread and margin also experienced compression during the fourth quarter of  as republic invested excess cash on a short term basis in order to mitigate the potential impact of future interest rate increases on net interest income 
management anticipates that the company s net interest margin and net interest spread will increase significantly during the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of due to seasonal ral activity at refunds now 
because ral volume occurs primarily in the first quarter  the net interest spread and net interest margin for the remainder of will decline subsequent to the first quarter and could likely be lower than the corresponding periods in republic s cost of funds decreased basis points for compared to this decrease was primarily the result of lower borrowing costs from the fhlb and lower interest expense associated with certificates of deposit cds 
interest expense on fhlb borrowings decreased for the year due to the maturity or early payoff of approximately million of advances with a weighted average cost of subsequent to the second quarter of interest expense on cds decreased significantly due to the availability of lower cost funding sources that allowed the company to generally lower pricing on its cd product offerings 
as a result of strategic cd pricing  the company s overall average cd balances declined during for  net interest income was million  up million over the million attained during factors that effected net interest income in were different from those that affected it in republic was primarily able to increase its net interest income through balance sheet growth  particularly growth in mortgage backed securities mbss and loans 
while the loan portfolio decreased slightly during the first six months of  the company experienced strong growth in the loan portfolio during the last six months of  principally in residential real estate loans  commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit 
cash received during from the sale of loans into the secondary market as well as sales  calls and prepayments on investment securities was reinvested by the company into mbss 
the increases in the balances of loans and mbss were the significant factors in the company s overall increase in net interest income during compared to although  net interest income was higher during compared to  continued downward repricing of the bank s adjustable rate mortgage portfolio and the prepayment of higher yielding portfolio loans limited the company s ability to increase net interest income through changes in rate 
to help mitigate this  management elected to retain million in fixed rate  year residential real estate loans in october the company funded these loans through fhlb borrowings with terms of two to six years achieving a spread of approximately on this million positively affected the company s net interest income but negatively impacted the company s net interest spread and net interest margin 
the company also sold approximately million in mbss and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos during in anticipation of rapid prepayments due to declining long term market interest rates 
these securities had a bond equivalent yield of at the time of sale 
as an additional response to declining long term market interest rates and in order to reduce future borrowing costs  republic prepaid a million advance during from the fhlb with a coupon of

total overdraft fees increased from million in to million in while the total number of accounts eligible for the overdraft honor program increased to  at december  from  at december  additionally  the company s total number of checking accounts  exclusive of commercial accounts  increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase in the number of retail checking accounts was primarily attributable to the continued success of the company s maximum closing cost  secondary market loan product  which requires a primary checking account in order for the customer to receive the discounted closing fees 
a decrease in volume of the program could negatively impact the number of new company checking accounts 
conversely  republic s checking account base is expected to be positively impacted by accounts opened at the company s newest banking centers  direct mail solicitations and other marketing initiatives 
republic opened six new banking centers in and plans to open three new banking centers in early electronic refund check erc fees  the majority of which are received during the first quarter of the year  increased  in this increase was due primarily to the increase in overall erc volume compared to the prior year resulting from successful marketing efforts and an increase in the number of tax preparers 
the company also experienced significant growth in erc fees during compared to due primarily to the same reasons 
title insurance commissions increased  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in title insurance commissions are earned when title insurance policies are sold to clients in conjunction with newly originated real estate secured loans 
since a substantial portion of these commissions are earned on policies relating to single family family  secondary market real estate loans  the income closely correlates to secondary market loan origination volume  which was million during compared to million during management anticipates that title insurance commissions will decline in the first quarter of due to an expected reduction in secondary market loan volume 
title insurance commissions increased  for over the large volume of refinance activity in family  secondary market real estate loans during this period contributed to the increase for the year ended december  mortgage banking income includes net gain on sale of loans  loan servicing income and amortization of msrs 
mortgage banking income increased million during due primarily to a million increase in net gain on sale of loans resulting from the higher volume of loans sold into the secondary market 
this higher volume of loans sold in resulted from aggressive marketing of the company s loan product and sustained consumer demand for fixed rate  first mortgage residential loan products due to historically low market interest rates through the first six months of the year 
this demand began to decline substantially during the third quarter of reaching more traditional lower levels during the fourth quarter of as a percentage of loans sold  net gains increased to in compared to in the increase in gains as a percentage of loans sold primarily occurred in the first six months of during the first six months of  interest rates declined sharply  reaching historic lows in mid june 
the company was able to increase the gain on sale margins during this declining interest rate environment by selling directly to end investors achieving higher premiums 
in  the company does not expect gains as a percentage of loans sold to reach the level attained in due to higher coverage ratios as well as more competitive pricing to help maintain market share 
overall  the bank originated nearly million in mortgage loans held for sale during compared to million during the increase in net gain on sale of loans during was partially offset by a million increase in amortization expense of msrs 
this increase primarily resulted from two factors 
first  management elected to sell a higher percentage of loans with servicing retained in resulting in a larger msr asset to be amortized compared to secondly  a declining interest rate environment during the first six months of shortened the estimated life of the expected future servicing income due to projected prepayments on the underlying loans 
mortgage banking income increased during as declining market interest rates prompted an increase in consumer refinance activity of family  fixed rate residential loans 
revenue from mortgage banking activities  principally gains on sale of loans  increased as a result of higher secondary market sales volume 
as a percentage of loans sold  net gains on sale decreased to in compared to in the decrease in gains as a percentage of loans sold was primarily attributable to management s decision to offer more competitive pricing on its fixed rate  residential real estate products in order to gain market share

republic opened two banking centers during the third quarter of and six banking centers during the company also hired additional support staff to service the new banking center expansion activities 
total full time equivalent employees fte s increased to at december  from at december salary and employee benefits also increased for compared to the increase was primarily attributable to annual merit increases and associated incentive compensation accruals  additional seasonal staff at refunds now and a modest increase in staff to support secondary market origination volume 
total fte s increased to at december  from at december  the company recognized prepayment penalties of million and million on the early termination of advances from the fhlb during and the company elected to incur these penalties in order to refinance a portion of its advances from the fhlb into lower cost borrowings with extended maturities  taking advantage of the favorable interest rate environment at the time 
other expenses increased million during the increase was primarily related to credit underwriting costs and correspondent banking expenses associated with the company s deferred deposit program 
financial condition loan portfolio net loans  primarily consisting of secured real estate loans  increased by million to billion at december  commercial real estate loans  which comprise of the total loan portfolio at december   are concentrated primarily within the bank s existing markets 
these loans are principally secured by multi family investment properties  family developments  medical facilities  small business owner occupied offices  retail properties and hotels 
these loans typically have interest rates that are initially fixed for one to seven years with the remainder of the loan term subject to repricing based on various market indices 
in order to reduce the negative effect of refinance activity within the portfolio during a declining interest rate environment  the company requires an early termination penalty on substantially all commercial real estate loans for a portion of the fixed term period 
overall  commercial real estate loans increased million from december  during  republic maintained its underwriting standards  which typically includes personal guarantees on most commercial real estate loans 
pricing requirements  as well as the company s underwriting requirements  led to competitive pressure during as a result  the commercial real estate portfolio experienced modest growth compared to prior years 
similar to commercial real estate loans  residential real estate loans that are not sold into the secondary market typically have fixed interest rate periods of one to seven years with the remainder of the loan term subject to repricing based on various market indices 
these loans also typically carry early termination penalties during a portion of their fixed rate periods in order to lessen the overall negative effect to the company of refinancing in a declining interest rate environment 
despite early termination penalties on many of its portfolio residential real estate loans  the company experienced a high level of refinance activity into fixed rate secondary market products during however  residential real estate loans increased by million during due to management s election to retain three separate pools of secondary market eligible loans totaling million 
the total amount retained over the most recent fifteen month period totaled approximately million 
to fund these loans and mitigate the interest rate risk on this portion of the residential real estate loan portfolio  the company borrowed million in fhlb advances with maturities ranging from one to five years and million in brokered cds with maturities ranging from one to five years 
management anticipates earning an approximate spread of on these transactions  which will positively affect the company s net interest income in but will negatively impact the company s net interest spread and net interest margin 
the consumer loan portfolio principally consists of various short term  unsecured loans to individual clients 
also included in this category are deferred deposit transactions  which are considered loans under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company had approximately million in deferred deposit transactions outstanding at december  compared to million at december  home equity loans  substantially all approved at no more than of loan to value  increased from million at december  to million at december  the rise in outstandings was primarily the result of increased cross sale opportunities in conjunction with the origination of fixed rate  secondary market loan products as part of the company s partnership package 
as part of the package  the company s fixed rate  secondary market loan clients are usually approved for a home equity line of credit 
the company increased the number of home equity lines of credit during by 
at december   republic clients had million of home equity line balances available for funding 
in addition to changes in the traditional loan portfolio  loans serviced for others by republic increased from million at december   to million at december  loans serviced for others consists of loans republic has sold into the secondary market while retaining the servicing of the loans 
prior to  republic sold a substantial portion of its loans into the secondary market including the corresponding servicing of the loan 
beginning in  republic began selling a large portion of its loans directly to third party governmental agencies  which do not purchase the servicing component of the loan 
management elected to utilize this strategy due to more favorable pricing received from the governmental agencies  as well as faster funding to the company for the loans sold 
management will continue to evaluate the feasibility of selling or retaining the servicing component to third parties 
table loans by type as of december  in thousands real estate residential commercial construction commercial consumer home equity total loans mortgage loans held for sale is primarily comprised of fixed rate  family residential loans the company intends to sell into the secondary market 
although management elected to retain three separate pools of secondary market eligible loans in  it has traditionally been the company s strategy to sell the majority of its fixed rate family residential loans into the secondary market in order to reduce its exposure to market interest rate risk 
at december   mortgage loans held for sale was down significantly from million at year end to million at year end due to slowdown in refinancing activity resulting from rising interest rates during the second half of as a result of republic s mortgage banking operations  certain loan commitments are accounted for as derivatives 
in addition  republic enters into agreements to sell loans for amounts and terms offsetting the interest rate risk of loans held for sale and loan commitments expected to close 
these agreements to sell loans are also accounted for as derivatives 
sales contract derivatives are entered into for amounts and terms offsetting the interest rate risk of loan commitment derivatives 
both derivatives are carried at fair value with their changes in fair value included in earnings  which substantially offset each other

for the twelve months ended december   the provision for loan losses was million compared to million during the year of included in the provision for loan losses was  and million for rals during and the substantial decrease in losses associated with rals during was primarily the result of a significant reduction of errors in information received from government entities  which is used to underwrite rals 
the company also received better than expected collection of prior year losses 
this is largely due to the unusually high charge offs experienced during that in turn led to increased recovery opportunities during the tax season 
the total allowance for loan losses increased million from december  to million at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses was due to growth in commercial real estate lending  an overall change in the product mix within the loan portfolios and the increase in non performing loans 
management believes  based on information presently available  that it has adequately provided for loan losses at december  management continues to closely monitor the commercial real estate loan portfolio in detail  recognizing that commercial real estate loans generally carry a greater risk of loss than residential real estate loans

the increase in non accrual loans is primarily attributable to a single million commercial real estate development loan

asset liability management and market risk asset liability management control is designed to ensure safety and soundness  maintain liquidity and regulatory capital standards and achieve acceptable net interest income 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
management  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be republic s most significant market risk 
republic utilizes an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income are then evaluated 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis point increments 
assumptions based on growth expectations and on the historical behavior of republic s deposit and loan rates and their related balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
republic s interest sensitivity profile reflected a change from december  to december  given a sustained basis point downward shock to the yield curve used in the simulation model  republic s base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to a decrease of at december  given a basis point increase in the yield curve  republic s base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to a decrease of at december  the interest sensitivity profile of republic at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities as well as their relative pricing schedules 
it is also influenced by market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth and other factors 
the company s interest rate risk position at december  would be more negatively impacted in a decreasing interest rate environment than its interest rate risk position at december  due primarily to short term investing strategies of excess cash which management began utilizing during the latter part of the company s interest rate risk position from rising interest rates improved during this same time period due to the same short term investing strategies of excess cash and a lower assumption of prepayments within the loan and investment portfolios as of december  tables and illustrate republic s estimated annualized earnings sensitivity profile based on the asset liability model as of year end and table interest rate sensitivity for decrease in rates increase in rates dollars in thousands basis points basis points base basis points basis points projected interest income short term investments investments loans  excluding fees total interest income projected interest expense deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase federal home loan bank borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base table interest rate sensitivity for decrease in rates increase in rates dollars in thousands basis points basis points base basis points basis points projected interest income short term investments investments loans  excluding fees total interest income projected interest expense deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase federal home loan bank borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base market and dividend information republic s class a common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market system nasdaq under the symbol rbcaa
