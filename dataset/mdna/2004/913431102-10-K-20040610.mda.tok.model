disclosure regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
overview we provide a full range of natural gas compression services  including sales  operations  maintenance and fabrication services and products to the natural gas industry  both domestically and internationally 
through our core business  contract compression  and our fleet as of march  of approximately  compressor units comprising approximately million horsepower  we provide natural gas compression to domestic and international customers 
through our equipment fabrication business we design  engineer and assemble natural gas and air compressors for sale to third parties and for use in our contract compression fleet 
through our aftermarket services business  we sell parts and components and provide maintenance and operations services to customers who own their compression equipment or utilize equipment from our competitors 
these services and products are essential to the natural gas industry as gas must be compressed to be delivered from the wellhead to end users 
our customers consist primarily of domestic and international oil and gas companies  international state owned oil and gas companies  large and small independent producers and natural gas processors  gatherers and pipelines 
generally  our overall business activity and revenue increase as the demand for compression services increases 
in the united states  increases in compression demand are driven by growth in the production of natural gas and by declining reservoir pressure in maturing natural gas producing fields 
in international markets  increases in compression demand are driven by growth in natural gas industry infrastructure  environmental initiatives encouraging the production and consumption of natural gas and the growth in the worldwide transportation of natural gas 
the demand for compression services is also driven by general increases in the demand for energy fuel stocks  including  natural gas  which is generally driven by economic growth 
in addition  the outsourcing of compression needs is driven by the expectation of our customers for improved operating efficiency  increased flexibility to replace compressors as field requirements change and reduced capital requirements 
the compression industry experienced significant merger and acquisition activity in the s and through the outsourcing of compression services increased as a percentage of total industry activity in the s and early s as leading compression companies increased in overall size 
a high level of compression industry capital expenditures and reduced demand due to lackluster economic activity resulted in reduced utilization beginning in late and continued into industry utilization stabilized in the second half of calendar and increased during calendar as a result of reduced capital expenditures and increasing demand due to improving economic activity 
during calendar the industry did not materially increase the supply of contract compression units in the united states due to an emphasis on the redeployment of idle units while growth in international markets continued 
company performance trends during fiscal and fiscal  we increased our natural gas compression fleet  expanded fabrication capabilities for large horsepower units  added complementary aftermarket services and broadened our international operations 
capital expenditures in fiscal and fiscal were significantly lower than fiscal levels as we emphasized the redeployment of idle fleet units 
in fiscal  we had improved natural gas compression fleet utilization and increased revenues in fabrication and aftermarket services due primarily to improved industry conditions and the implementation of our focused business strategy 
fiscal financial highlights net income for the fiscal year ended march  declined compared to the prior year by million  or  primarily as a result of debt extinguishment costs of million million net of tax related to our refinancing activity during the three months ended june  significant items for the fiscal years are discussed as follows higher revenue 
total revenue was higher by million  or  for the fiscal year ended march  due primarily to higher levels of activity across all four of our business segments 
debt extinguishment costs 
the debt extinguishment costs of million included in the fiscal year results primarily related to the may refinancing and consisted of the write off of deferred financing costs of million  premium costs of million and million in transaction expenses 
lower combined operating lease and interest expense 
compared to the prior fiscal year  on a combined basis  these items were lower by million  or  primarily as a result of the company s refinancing of million of long term debt in may  which both reduced the amount of the company s long term debt outstanding by approximately million and lowered the interest rate on that debt to from 
higher depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  due primarily to depreciation of on going capital expenditures and the inclusion of additional compression equipment on the company s balance sheet as of december  fiscal operating highlights the higher revenue for the fiscal year ended march   is attributable to increased industry activity and customer demand  which resulted in higher utilization in both the domestic and international contract compression fleets and increased sales in the fabrication and aftermarket services businesses 
the following table summarizes total available horsepower  average contracted horsepower  horsepower utilization percentages and fabrication backlog 
for the year ended march  horsepower in thousands total available horsepower at period end domestic contract compression   international contract compression total   average contracted horsepower domestic contract compression   international contract compression total   horsepower utilization spot at period end average as of march  in millions fabrication backlog domestic average contracted horsepower increased by for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  international average contracted horsepower increased by for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
these increases were primarily attributable to higher customer demand 
the decrease in domestic horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  from the prior year was primarily attributable to the sale of units to customers exercising purchase options on compression equipment 
the increase in international horsepower was primarily attributable to horsepower that was added in latin america 
the backlog of fabrication projects at june  was approximately million 
a majority of the backlog is expected to be completed within a day period 
financial results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  the following table summarizes revenue  gross profit  gross margin  expenses and the respective percentages for each of our business segments year ended march  dollars in thousands revenue domestic contract compression   of revenue international contract compression   of revenue fabrication   of revenue aftermarket services   of revenue total revenue   gross profit domestic contract compression   international contract compression   fabrication   aftermarket services   total gross profit   gross margin domestic contract compression international contract compression fabrication aftermarket services total gross margin expenses depreciation and amortization   selling  general and administrative   operating lease expense  interest expense  net   debt extinguishment costs  foreign currency gain loss other income   facility consolidation costs  income taxes   net income   revenue 
total revenue increases were realized across all business segments for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year 
domestic contract compression revenue increased due to higher average contract rates and improved utilization  both of which contributed equally to the increase 
international contract compression revenue increased primarily as a result of additional compression business in brazil and argentina  which contributed increases of million and million  respectively 
fabrication revenue increased due to additional projects for customers in our united states and canadian regions resulting in increases of million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by declines in the asia pacific region of million and the latin american region of million 
revenue from fabrication fluctuates quarter to quarter due to the timing of receipt of orders placed by customers and due to the timing of recognition of revenue  which occurs at the time of shipment 
aftermarket services revenue was higher due primarily to increased customer demand in the united states million  canada million and the asia pacific region million 
gross profit 
the changes to gross profit defined as total revenues less direct costs for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year were primarily attributable to revenue increases discussed above for domestic contract compression  international contract compression and aftermarket services 
fabrication gross profit decreased due to higher costs in the first fiscal quarter primarily as a result of cost overruns related to several highly customized fabrication projects for customers in the asia pacific region 
ebitda  as adjusted 
ebitda  as adjusted  for the fiscal year ended march  was million 
the increase in ebitda of from the prior year is primarily attributable to the revenue increases discussed above for domestic contract compression  international contract compression and aftermarket services 
ebitda  as adjusted is defined  discussed and reconciled to net income on page of this report  within item  selected financial data 
depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year resulted from on going capital additions which increased depreciation by approximately million and the inclusion of additional compression equipment on the balance sheet as of december  due to the consolidation of the operating lease facilities 
depreciation expense related to this equipment began january  and was partially offset by the change in estimated useful lives of the compressor fleet discussed below 
the combined impact of the consolidation of the compressor equipment in the operating lease facilities and the extension of the useful lives of the compressor fleet at december  increased depreciation expense by approximately million 
in fiscal  we evaluated the estimated useful lives used for book depreciation purposes for our compressor fleet based upon equipment type  key components and industry experience of the actual useful life in the field 
the evaluation was finalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based upon the findings of the evaluation  the estimated useful lives of the majority of the existing compressor units were extended to years from years 
in addition  a portion of the units remained at the previous years or less and a portion of the units were extended to years 
the change in useful lives was effective january  combined operating lease expense and interest expense 
taking into account the effect of the consolidation of the lease facilities on december   the combined operating lease expense and interest expense  for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by million  or compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to may refinancing activities  which reduced outstanding long term debt by approximately million and lowered the interest rate on million of indebtedness to from 
interest expense decreased million as a result of the million reduction in debt and decreased million due to the lower interest rate on the million of indebtedness 
operating lease expense 
as a result of the consolidation of the lease facilities  there was no operating lease expense related to the operating lease facilities during the fiscal year ended march  the operating lease expense related to the operating lease facilities has been recognized as interest expense subsequent to the consolidation of the lease facilities on december  interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  increased for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year primarily due to the consolidation of the operating lease facilities as of december  which resulted in the classification of operating lease expense subsequent to december  as interest expense 
debt extinguishment costs 
debt extinguishment costs incurred during the fiscal year ended march  were primarily due to the early extinguishment of universal s outstanding million senior discount notes due in may the net proceeds from the offering by universal of new senior discount notes due and available funds were used to pay for the extinguishment of the senior discount notes due as a result of the early extinguishment of debt  a charge of million was recognized resulting from the redemption and tender premiums of million  write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million and million of other costs 
additional debt extinguishment costs of million resulted from the buyback of million of our senior notes during the three months ended march  other income  net 
other income  net of other expenses  for both the fiscal year ended march  and the prior year  was primarily comprised of gains from the sale of domestic contract compression equipment  primarily due to customers exercising purchase options 
facility consolidation costs 
facility consolidation costs related to the transfer of the tulsa  oklahoma fabrication operations to the houston fabrication facility were million during the year ended march  these costs were primarily for severance  personnel costs and relocation costs 
the company does not expect to incur additional facility consolidation costs during the two year period ending september  fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  the following table summarizes revenue  gross profit  gross margin  expenses and the respective percentages for each of our business segments year ended march  dollars in thousands revenue domestic contract compression   of revenue international contract compression   of revenue fabrication   of revenue aftermarket services   of revenue total revenue   gross profit domestic contract compression   international contract compression   fabrication   aftermarket services   total gross profit   gross margin domestic contract compression international contract compression fabrication aftermarket services total gross margin expenses depreciation and amortization   selling  general and administrative   operating lease expense   interest expense  net   foreign currency gain loss other income loss  net  income taxes   net income   revenue 
total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  decreased million  or  to million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  largely as a result of declines in fabrication and aftermarket services 
domestic contract compression revenue decreased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  international contract compression revenue increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in domestic contract compression revenue was a result of lower horsepower utilization in a period of reduced energy industry activity that resulted in a reduced demand for contract compression services 
the increase in international contract compression revenue resulted from new contract settlements negotiated with our argentina customers in the first quarter of fiscal year and expansion of our business in the latin america and asia pacific regions 
domestic average contracted horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  decreased slightly to approximately  horsepower from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  primarily due to the general decline in energy industry activity in the united states 
international average contracted horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to approximately  horsepower from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march   primarily through expansion of the international contract compression fleet 
the combined average horsepower utilization rate for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately  down from in the fiscal year ended march  as of march   universal had approximately million available horsepower with an average horsepower utilization rate for the quarter then ended of and for the same period one year earlier of approximately 
fabrication revenue decreased to million from million  a decrease of due to lower demand for customer owned compressors in a period of reduced energy industry activity 
backlog of fabrication projects at the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  compared with a backlog of million at march  from december  to march   backlog decreased million 
the backlog as of may  was approximately million 
aftermarket services revenue decreased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of 
the decrease resulted from reduced repair and maintenance activity from universal s north american customer base in a period of reduced energy industry activity 
gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  decreased million  or  to million from gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended march  reflecting declines in fabrication and aftermarket services that were partially offset by an increase in international contract compression 
fabrication gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  decreased million  or  to million compared to a gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended march  fabrication gross profit decreased primarily due to lower demand during the fiscal year 
aftermarket services gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  decreased million or  to million compared to a gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended march  aftermarket services gross profit decreased primarily due to the overall slowdown in energy industry activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  selling  general and administrative expenses represented of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  compared to of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  the increase was primarily due to a greater presence in international markets  which carries higher administration costs and severance costs related to staff reductions 
ebitda as adjusted 
ebitda  as adjusted  for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to million from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to increases in the selling  general and administrative costs 
ebitda  as adjusted  is defined  discussed and reconciled to net income on page of this report  within item  selected financial data 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million during the fiscal year ended march   compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  depreciation expense increased due to a full twelve months of depreciation of fiscal capital additions and capitalized overhauls 
in addition  depreciation expense increased due to the three months of depreciation of gas compressor units that were not previously recorded on universal s balance sheet until december   when the lessors under the operating lease facilities became fully consolidated entities 
depreciation expense related to these assets began january  and increased depreciation expense for the fiscal year ended march  by approximately million 
in fiscal  universal evaluated the estimated useful lives used for book depreciation purposes for its compressor fleet based upon equipment type  key components and industry experience of the actual useful life in the field 
the evaluation was finalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based upon the findings of the evaluation  the estimated useful lives of the majority of the existing compressor units were extended to years from years 
in addition  a portion of the units remained at the previous years or less and a portion of the units were extended to years 
the change in useful lives was effective january  the impact from extending the estimated useful lives of the equipment that was recorded on universal s balance sheet on december  excluding the gas compression equipment related to the operating lease facilities reduced depreciation expense by approximately million for the year ended march  the combined impact as a result of the consolidation of the compressor equipment in the operating lease facilities and the extension of the estimated useful lives was an increase to depreciation expense of approximately million and a decrease to net income of million for the year ended march  operating lease expense 
operating lease expense decreased to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  operating lease expense related to the operating lease facilities has been recognized as interest expense subsequent to the consolidation of the lease facilities on december  as a result  universal recognized no operating lease expense for the quarter ended march  interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  increased million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  primarily due to the consolidation of the operating lease facilities as of december  which resulted in the classification of operating lease expense subsequent to december  as interest expense 
net income 
net income decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to a net income of million for the fiscal year ended march  for the reasons noted above 
effects of inflation in recent years  inflation has been modest and has not had a material impact upon the results of our operations 
liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of cash are operating expenditures  capital expenditures and long term debt repayments 
operations 
net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net cash used in investing and financing activities by million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
based on current market conditions  we expect that net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to finance our operating expenditures  capital expenditures and debt repayments through the fiscal year 
working capital  net of cash  was million and million at march  and march   respectively 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended march  were million consisting of million for fleet additions  million for compressor overhauls  million for service trucks and million for machinery  equipment  information technology equipment and other items 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately to million for the fiscal year ending march   including approximately million for compression fleet maintenance capital 
historically  we have financed capital expenditures with net cash provided by operations and financing activities 
if we were to make significant additional acquisitions for cash  we might need to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
long term debt 
as of march   we had approximately million in outstanding debt obligations consisting primarily of million outstanding under the seven year term senior secured notes operating lease facility  consisting of senior notes due and term loan due together  the brl lease facility  million outstanding of senior notes due  and million outstanding under the asset backed securitization lease facility the abs lease facility 
the maturities of this debt are shown below 
we expect to pay these principal payments through cash generated by operations and debt refinancing activity 
in thousands thereafter  total debt  availability 
as of march   after giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit under our financing documents  we had an aggregate unused credit availability of approximately million from our revolving credit facility and our abs lease facility 
refinancing activity 
in may  universal commenced a tender offer to purchase the outstanding million aggregate principal amount of its senior discount notes due at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus a premium of  for notes tendered prior to the early expiration date for the tender offer 
of these notes  million were tendered on or before the early tender date  and universal purchased those notes on may  on that date  universal called for redemption of the remaining million of its senior discount notes due at of the principal amount in accordance with the terms of the indenture relating to the notes 
this redemption price was less than the total consideration offered pursuant to the tender offer for notes tendered on or before the early tender date 
during june  the remaining million of this debt was redeemed or repurchased 
also in may  universal issued million of its senior notes due in a private placement 
the net proceeds from the sale  together with other available funds  were used to purchase the outstanding senior discount notes due as discussed above 
universal exchanged the private notes for publicly traded notes during the second quarter of fiscal during the three months ended march  we repurchased million of our senior notes due february we repurchased an additional million of our senior notes in april and will continue to look at opportunistic repurchases subject to market conditions 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our cash contractual obligations as of march  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years total debt      capital leases   total contractual cash obligations    critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare these financial statements in conformity with gaap 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the accounting policies we believe require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position are as follows allowances and reserves our customers are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of credit 
we maintain an allowance for bad debts based on specific customer collection issues and historical experience 
on an on going basis  we conduct an evaluation of the financial strength of our customers based on payment history and make adjustments to the allowance as necessary 
since most of our customers are in the energy industry  their ability to pay balances due could be affected by dramatic changes in the price and demand for their products 
we record a reserve against our inventory balance for estimated obsolescence 
this reserve is based on specific identification and historical experience 
depreciation property  plant and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation for financial reporting purposes is computed on the straight line basis using estimated useful lives 
for compression equipment  depreciation begins with the first compression service using a salvage value 
the estimated useful lives prior to january  for compression equipment was years and for other properties and equipment from to years 
the company evaluated the estimated useful life used for book depreciation purposes for its compressor fleet based upon equipment type  key components and industry experience of the actual useful life in the field 
the evaluation was finalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based upon the findings of the evaluation  the estimated useful lives of the majority of the existing compressor units were extended to years from years 
in addition  a portion of the units remained at years or less and a portion of the units were extended to years 
business combinations and goodwill goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as in determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill 
we perform an impairment test for goodwill assets annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
our goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with their carrying value 
the fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and other market related valuation models 
certain estimates and judgments are required in the application of the fair value models 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we performed an impairment analysis in accordance with sfas no 
and determined that no impairment had occurred  however  if for any reason the fair value of our goodwill or that of any of our reporting units declines below the carrying value in the future  we may incur charges for the impairment 
long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  definite lived intangibles and other assets comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used by us are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets to be held and used  we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through the use of undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
if an impairment has occurred  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
self insurance we are self insured up to certain levels for general liability  vehicle liability  group medical and for workers compensation claims for certain of our employees 
we record self insurance accruals based on claims filed and an estimate for significant claims incurred but not reported 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through insurance reserves 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  it is reasonably possible our estimates of these liabilities will change over the near term as circumstances develop 
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events are considered other than enactments of changes in the tax law or rates 
we provide contract compression services to a global market 
as such  we are subject to taxation not only in the united states but also in numerous foreign jurisdictions 
having to consider these different jurisdictions complicates the estimate of future taxable income  which in turn determines the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including assumptions on future operating conditions and asset utilization 
the judgments and assumptions used to determine future taxable income are consistent with those used for other financial statement purposes 
additionally  we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets 
the principal tax planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the foreign earnings are analyzed and reviewed annually for changes in our international and domestic business outlook 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
an entity is subject to the consolidation rules of fin and is referred to as a variable interest entity vie if the entity s equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its operations without additional financial support

seasonal fluctuations our results of operations have not historically reflected any material seasonal tendencies 
risk factors as described in part i 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements  this report contains forward looking statements regarding us  our business and our industry 
the risk factors described below  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
additional risks not currently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect us 
we depend on strong demand for natural gas and a prolonged  substantial reduction in this demand could adversely affect the demand for our services and products 
gas contract compression operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for natural gas 
demand may be affected by  among other factors  natural gas prices  weather  demand for energy and availability of alternative energy sources 
any prolonged  substantial reduction in the demand for natural gas would  in all likelihood  depress the level of production  exploration and development activity and result in a decline in the demand for our contract compression services and products 
similarly  a decrease in capital spending by our customers could result in reduced demand for our fabrication and aftermarket services businesses 
these events could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our international operations subject us to risks that are difficult to predict 
for the year ended march   we derived approximately of our revenue from international operations 
we intend to continue to expand our business in latin america  and asia pacific and  ultimately  other international markets 
this may make it more difficult for us to manage our business 
reasons for this include  but are not limited to  the following political and economic instability in foreign markets  foreign governments restrictive trade policies  inconsistent product regulation or sudden policy changes by foreign agencies or governments  the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws  the imposition of duties  taxes or government royalties  foreign exchange rate risks  difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable  potentially longer payment cycles  increased costs in maintaining international manufacturing and marketing efforts  the introduction of non tariff barriers and higher duty rates  difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations  restrictions on repatriation of earnings or expropriation of property  and the geographic  time zone  language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world 
any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance 
the contract compression  fabrication  and aftermarket services businesses are highly competitive and there are low barriers to entry for individual projects 
in addition  some of our competitors are large national and multinational companies that provide contract compression and fabrication services to third parties  some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
if our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products and services  we may not be able to compete effectively 
we are dependent on particular suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases 
some of the components used in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks  including price increases  inferior component quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner 
the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
natural gas operations entail inherent risks and we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities 
natural gas service operations are subject to inherent risks such as equipment defects  malfunction and failures  and natural disasters that can result in uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids  fires and explosions 
these risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury  death  property damage  pollution and other environmental damages 
although we have obtained insurance against many of these risks  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to cover our liabilities 
further  insurance covering the risks we face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or  if available  the premiums may not be commercially justifiable 
if we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits  or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the sale of stock by weatherford  which currently owns approximately of our common stock  may depress our stock price 
weatherford has registered with the united states securities and exchange commission  and may sell at any time  up to  of its shares of our common stock 
in addition  the other  shares of our common stock owned by weatherford are subject to registration rights and may be resold at any time 
the sale of substantial amounts of our stock owned by weatherford in the public market  or the belief that these sales may occur  could reduce the market price of our stock  making it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock and to acquire businesses using our stock as consideration 
weatherford s voting power may give it the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
weatherford s  shares  or approximately  of our outstanding common stock may give it the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
if weatherford sells all of the  shares it has registered with the united states securities and exchange commission  it would nonetheless continue to own beneficially approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of such date 
in addition to its voting power  weatherford and its affiliates are entitled to designate three persons to serve on our board of directors for so long as they own at least of our outstanding common stock 
if weatherford s ownership falls below  weatherford may designate only two directors 
if weatherford s ownership falls below  it will no longer have the right to designate directors to our board 
this significant stock ownership and board representation gives weatherford the ability to exercise substantial influence over our ownership  policies  management and affairs and significant control over actions requiring approval of our stockholders 
weatherford s interests could conflict with our other stockholders 
we are a holding company and rely on our subsidiaries for operating income 
we are a holding company and  as such  derive all of our operating income from our operating subsidiary  universal compression  inc  and its subsidiaries 
we do not have any significant assets other than the stock of our operating subsidiary 
consequently  we are dependent on the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that are not legally obligated to make funds available to us  and in some cases may be contractually restricted from doing so 
we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to  or be permitted to  pay to us amounts necessary to meet our obligations 
we are highly leveraged  a significant portion of our cash flow must be used to service our obligations and we are vulnerable to interest rate increases 
we have now and will continue to have a significant amount of debt 
as of march   we had approximately million in outstanding debt obligations consisting primarily of million outstanding under the seven year term senior secured notes operating lease facility  consisting of senior notes due and term loan due  the brl lease facility  and million outstanding of senior notes due and million outstanding under the the abs lease facility 
this amount excludes approximately million of letters of credit  as of march   issued under our million senior secured revolving credit facility 
as of march   approximately million of our outstanding debt bore interest at floating rates 
changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates  thereby increasing our interest expense and reducing our funds available to make payments of interest and principal on the notes and for capital investment  operations or other purposes 
our significant leverage increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
our credit facilities and lease facilities impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
our credit facilities and lease facilities include certain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to borrow money  create liens  other than a lien securing the revolving credit facility  the brl lease facility or the abs lease facility  sell or transfer any of our material property  merge into or consolidate with any third party or sell or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  and make capital expenditures 
we and our subsidiaries are also required by our credit facilities to maintain debt coverage ratios  interest coverage ratios and a specified tangible net worth 
all of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the indentures and the credit facilities may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance  changes in business conditions or results of operation  adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our debt  which could cause those obligations to become due and payable 
if any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that we would be able to repay or refinance it 
we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
historically  our foreign operations  including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses  have been denominated in various currencies other than the us dollar  and we expect that our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated 
as a result  the us dollar value of our foreign operations has varied  and will continue to vary  with exchange rate fluctuations 
in this respect  historically we have been primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the argentine peso  brazilian real  thai baht  mexican peso  australian dollar and canadian dollar against the us dollar 
a decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in us dollars in our financial statements 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars 
in addition  fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period to period comparisons of our reported results of operations 
for purposes of accounting  the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations  where the local currency is the functional currency  are translated using period end exchange rates  and the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated using average exchange rates during each period 
although we attempt to match costs and revenues in local currencies  we anticipate that there may be instances in which costs and revenues will not be matched with respect to currency denomination 
as a result  to the extent we continue our expansion on a global basis  we expect that increasing portions of our revenues  costs  assets and liabilities will be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency valuations 
we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
further  the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency  resulting in our inability to hedge against these risks 
we intend to continue to make substantial capital investments to implement our business strategy  which may reduce funds available for other operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to make substantial capital investments to expand and maintain our contract compression fleet 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended march  were million consisting of million for fleet additions  million for compressor overhauls  million for service trucks and million for machinery  equipment  information technology equipment and other items 
we expect to spend between and million on capital expenditures during fiscal year  approximately million of which would be used for compression fleet maintenance capital 
historically  we have paid for these investments through internally generated funds and external financings 
these significant capital investments require cash that we could otherwise apply to other business needs 
however  if we do not incur these expenditures while our competitors make substantial fleet investments  our market share may decline and our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash internally or obtain alternative sources of capital to fund our proposed capital expenditures  it could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and growth 
our ability to manage our business effectively will be weakened if we lose key personnel 
we depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
the departure of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage with respect to our executive officers or key management personnel 
we are not aware of the upcoming retirement of any of our executive officers or senior management personnel 
in addition  we believe that our success depends on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
if we fail to recruit other skilled personnel  we could be unable to compete effectively 
we are subject to substantial environmental regulation  and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities 
we are subject to stringent and complex foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulatory standards  including laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment  emission controls and other environmental protection and occupational health and safety concerns 
environmental laws and regulations may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering us liable for remediation costs  natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of  or conditions caused by  prior owners or operators or other third parties 
in addition  where contamination may be present  it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury  property damage and recovery of response costs 
remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations  and costs associated with new information  changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
we routinely deal with natural gas  oil and other petroleum products 
as a result of our fabrication and aftermarket services operations  we generate  manage and dispose of or recycle hazardous wastes and substances such as solvents  thinner  waste paint  waste oil  washdown wastes and sandblast material 
although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on  under or from properties owned  leased or operated by us or on or under other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties may be subject to investigatory  remediation and monitoring requirements under foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
nevertheless  the modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations  the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations  or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us and other similarly situated service companies 
future terrorist attacks or responses thereto could adversely affect our company 
the impact that future events arising as a result of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september   or any terrorist attacks that may occur in the future  including military or police activities in the united states  iraq or other foreign countries  future terrorist activities or threats of such activities  political unrest and instability  riots and protests  could have on the united states economy  the global economy  global financial markets and our business cannot currently be determined with any accuracy 
a third party could be prevented from acquiring control of us because of the anti takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws 
there are provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would result in the purchase of your shares at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to you 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  such as a staggered board of directors and limitations on the removal of directors  no stockholder action by written consent and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
delaware corporation law may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by our board of directors

domestic contract compression revenue increased due to higher average contract rates and improved utilization  both of which contributed equally to the increase 
international contract compression revenue increased primarily as a result of additional compression business in brazil and argentina  which contributed increases of million and million  respectively 
fabrication revenue increased due to additional projects for customers in our united states and canadian regions resulting in increases of million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by declines in the asia pacific region of million and the latin american region of million 
revenue from fabrication fluctuates quarter to quarter due to the timing of receipt of orders placed by customers and due to the timing of recognition of revenue  which occurs at the time of shipment 
aftermarket services revenue was higher due primarily to increased customer demand in the united states million  canada million and the asia pacific region million 
gross profit 
the changes to gross profit defined as total revenues less direct costs for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year were primarily attributable to revenue increases discussed above for the domestic contract compression  the international contract compression and the aftermarket services business segments 
fabrication gross profit decreased due to higher costs in the first fiscal quarter primarily as a result of cost overruns related to several highly customized fabrication projects for customers in the asia pacific region

depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year resulted from on going capital additions which increased depreciation by approximately million and the inclusion of additional compression equipment on the balance sheet as of december  due to the consolidation of the operating lease facilities 
depreciation expense related this equipment began january  and was partially offset by the change in estimated useful lives of the compressor fleet discussed below 
the combined impact of the consolidation of the compressor equipment in the operating lease facilities and the extension of the useful lives of the compressor fleet at december  increased depreciation expense by approximately million 
in fiscal  universal evaluated the estimated useful lives used for book depreciation purposes for its compressor fleet based upon equipment type  key components and industry experience of the actual useful life in the field 
the evaluation was finalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based upon the findings of the evaluation  the estimated useful lives of the majority of the existing compressor units were extended to years from years 
in addition  a portion of the units remained at the previous years or less and a portion of the units were extended to years 
the change in useful lives was effective january  combined operating lease expense and interest expense 
taking into account the effect of the consolidation of the lease facilities on december   the combined operating lease expense and interest expense  for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by million  or compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to may refinancing activities  which reduced outstanding long term debt by approximately million and lowered the interest rate on million of indebtedness to from

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to some market risk due to the floating or variable interest rates under our financing arrangements 
some of the interest and lease payments under our financing arrangements are based on a floating rate plus an applicable margin 
the variable interest rate under our revolving credit facility  which had no amounts outstanding as of march   is based upon either a base rate or libor  at our option  and the applicable margin is a variable amount from to based on a leverage ratio 
the variable interest rate under our million term loan is based upon the one month libor rate and the applicable margin is a fixed 
the one month libor at june  was 
the variable interest rate applicable to million of our senior notes due pursuant to an interest rate swap is based upon the six month libor rate 
the six month libor rate at june  was 
as of march   approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness and other obligations bore interest at floating rates and a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million annual increase in our interest expense 
we hold interest rate swaps related to the abs lease facility 
at march   the fair market value of these interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately million  which was recorded as a noncurrent liability 
the interest rate swaps terminate in february the weighted average fixed rate of these swaps is 
to minimize any significant foreign currency credit risk  we generally contractually require that payment by our customers be made in us dollars 
if payment is not made in us dollars  we generally utilize the exchange rate into us dollars on the payment date or balance payments in local currency against local expenses
