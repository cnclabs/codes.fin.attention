item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  regarding recent price fluctuations and their effect on our results 
business strategy the primary components of our business strategy are acquiring long lived  operated oil and gas properties  including undeveloped leases  increasing production and reserves through aggressive management of operations and through development  exploitation and exploration activities  hedging a portion of our production to stabilize cash flow and protect the economic return on development projects  and retaining management and technical staff that have substantial experience in our core areas 
acquiring long lived  operated properties 
we seek to acquire long lived  operated producing properties that contain complex multiple producing horizons with the potential for increases in reserves and production  produce from non conventional sources  including tight natural gas reservoirs  coal bed methane and natural gas producing shale formations  are in core operating areas or in areas with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics  and present opportunities to reduce expenses per mcfe through more efficient operations 
we believe that the properties we acquire provide opportunities to increase production and reserves through the implementation of mechanical and operational improvements  workovers  behind pipe completions  secondary recovery operations  new development wells and other development activities 
we also seek to acquire facilities related to gathering  processing  marketing and transporting oil and gas in areas where we own reserves 
such facilities can enhance profitability  reduce costs  and provide marketing flexibility and access to additional markets 
the ability to successfully purchase properties is dependent upon  among other things  competition for such purchases and the availability of financing to supplement internally generated cash flow 
we also seek to acquire undeveloped properties that potentially have the same attributes as targeted producing properties 
increasing production and reserves 
a principal component of our strategy is to increase production and reserves through aggressive management of operations and low risk development 
we believe that our principal properties possess geologic and reservoir characteristics that make them well suited for production increases through drilling and other development programs 
we have generated an inventory of approximately  potential drilling locations 
additionally  we review operations and mechanical data on operated properties to determine if actions can 
table of contents 
index to financial statements be taken to reduce operating costs or increase production 
such actions include installing  repairing and upgrading lifting equipment  redesigning downhole equipment to improve production from different zones  modifying gathering and other surface facilities and conducting restimulations and recompletions 
we may also initiate  upgrade or revise existing secondary recovery operations 
exploration activities 
during  we plan to focus our exploration activities on projects that are near currently owned productive fields 
we believe that we can prudently and successfully add growth potential through exploratory activities given improved technology  our experienced technical staff and our expanded base of operations 
we have allocated approximately million of our million development budget for exploration activities 
hedging activities 
we enter futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts 
our policy is to routinely hedge a portion of our production at commodity prices management deems attractive 
while there is a risk we may not be able to realize the benefit of rising prices  management plans to continue its hedging strategy because of the benefits provided by predictable  stable cash flow  including ability to more efficiently plan and execute our development program  which facilitates predictable production growth  ability to enter long term arrangements with drilling contractors  allowing us to continue development projects when product prices decline  more consistent returns on investment  and better utilization of our personnel 
experienced management and technical staff 
most senior management and technical staff have worked together for over years and have substantial experience in our core operating areas

we may also acquire working interests in nonoperated producing properties if such interests otherwise meet our acquisition criteria 
we attempt to acquire nonoperated interests in fields where the operators have a significant interest to protect  including potential undeveloped reserves that will be exploited by the operator 
we may also acquire nonoperated interests in order to ultimately accumulate sufficient ownership interests to operate the properties 
we also attempt to acquire a portion of our reserves as royalty interests 
royalty interests have few operational liabilities because they do not participate in operating activities and do not bear production or development costs 
royalty trusts and publicly traded partnerships 
we have created and sold units in publicly traded royalty trusts 
sales of royalty trust units allow us to more efficiently capitalize our mature  lower growth properties 
we may create and distribute or sell interests in additional royalty trusts or publicly traded partnerships in the future 
business goals 
in january  we announced a strategic goal for of increasing gas production by to over levels 
with the announcement of additional acquisitions in february  we updated our goal to increase gas production by to over levels 
to achieve this growth target  we plan to drill about net development wells and perform approximately net workovers and recompletions in we have budgeted billion for our development and acquisition programs  which is expected to be substantially funded by cash flow from operations 
we plan to allocate million of the capital budget to acquisitions  including million of acquisitions in january and million expected to close in april see note to consolidated financial statements  and million to development and exploration 
of the million development budget  we plan to spend million in east texas and louisiana  a total of million in the arkoma  raton and san juan basins  a total of million for development in alaska  the permian basin and hugoton royalty trust properties and million in the barnett shale of north texas 
we expect to spend million for exploration 

table of contents 
index to financial statements if acquisitions are available in excess of our million budget  we expect to fund a portion of our acquisitions with publicly placed equity securities 
strategic property acquisitions during may alter the amount currently budgeted for development and exploration 
the weak us dollar  raw material shortages and strong demand for steel in china and europe have tightened worldwide steel supplies  causing prices to rise by more than since november in response  we have increased our tubular inventory and are currently negotiating contracts with our vendors to support our development program 
should steel prices continue to escalate  our development budget could rise by as much as 
while we expect to acquire adequate supplies to complete our development program  a further tightening of steel supplies could restrain the program  limiting our production growth 
we may reevaluate our budget and drilling programs in the event of significant changes in oil and gas prices to focus on opportunities offering the highest rates of return and may increase our budget 
our ability to achieve our production goals will depend on the success of these planned drilling programs or  if property acquisitions are made in place of a portion of the drilling program  the success of those acquisitions

our fault block analysis technique has identified trapped hydrocarbons in offsetting and new reservoirs across the basin 
during  we drilled wells and completed workovers  of which were stimulation recompletions and of which were wellhead compressor installations 
our properties can be separated into three distinct areas which are the arkansas fairway trend  the arkansas overthrust trend and the oklahoma cromwell atoka trend 
arkansas fairway trend the arkansas fairway trend comprises multiple sandstones at depths ranging from  to  feet in the atoka and morrow intervals 
in  the orr and hale sandstones were targets for our drilling focused in the aetna and cecil fields 
thirty two wells were drilled and workovers were performed in in  we plan to drill wells 
arkansas overthrust trend the arkansas overthrust trend area  located south of the arkansas fairway trend  typically has multiple thrust faults that created isolated reservoirs 
production is found at varying depths  ranging from  to  feet  in the chismville  booneville and gragg fields 
this extremely complex geology requires an ongoing process to develop the best exploitation opportunities 
the use of electric imaging logs has enhanced the process of identifying new well locations 
in  acre well spacing was approved in the booneville and chismville fields and acre well spacing was approved in the gragg field 
this down spacing added to potential well locations for both operated and non operated wells 
we drilled wells and completed workovers in this area in we plan to drill wells in oklahoma cromwell atoka trend the oklahoma cromwell atoka trend of southeastern oklahoma was originally developed in the s targeting the cromwell sandstones  with the atoka and wapanuka limestones as secondary objectives 
development activities were concentrated in the ashland and south pine hollow fields where wells were drilled and four workovers were performed in in  we plan to drill five wells in this area 
hugoton royalty trust areas a substantial portion of properties in the mid continent area  the hugoton area and the green river basin of the rocky mountains are subject to an net profits interest conveyed to the hugoton royalty trust as of december we sold of our hugoton royalty trust units in and mid continent area xto is one of the largest producers in the major and woodward counties  oklahoma area of the anadarko basin

year end average realized prices used in the estimation of proved reserves were per mcf for gas  per bbl for natural gas liquids and per bbl for oil 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding estimated proved reserves 
estimated future net cash flows  and the related discounted present value  of year end proved reserves are significantly higher than at year end because of increased reserves related to acquisitions and development and higher product prices used in the estimation of year end proved reserves 
year end product prices were per mcf for gas  per bbl for natural gas liquids and per bbl for oil 
uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof 
as a result  estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as change in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
accordingly  oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered will vary from reserve estimates 
during  we filed estimates of oil and gas reserves as of december  with the us department of energy on form eia and form eia these estimates are consistent with the reserve data reported for the year ended december  in note to consolidated financial statements  with the exception that form eia includes only reserves from properties that we operate

see note to consolidated financial statements 
the company s production and reserves are adequate to meet the above delivery commitments 
competition and markets we face competition from other oil and gas companies in all aspects of our business  including acquisition of producing properties and oil and gas leases  marketing of oil and gas  and obtaining goods  services and labor 
many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources 
factors that affect xto s ability to acquire producing properties include available funds  available information about the property and our standards established 
table of contents 
index to financial statements for minimum projected return on investment 
gathering systems are the only practical method for the intermediate transportation of natural gas 
therefore  competition for natural gas delivery is presented by other pipelines and gathering systems 
competition is also presented by alternative fuel sources  including heating oil  imported liquified natural gas and other fossil fuels 
because of the long lived  high margin nature of our oil and gas reserves and management s experience and expertise in exploiting these reserves  management believes that it effectively competes in the market 
our ability to market oil and gas depends on many factors beyond our control  including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and gas  the proximity of our gas production to pipelines  the available capacity in such pipelines  the demand for oil and gas  and the effects of weather and state and federal regulation 
we cannot assure that we will always be able to market all of our production at favorable prices 
the company does not currently believe that the loss of any of our oil or gas purchasers would have a material adverse effect on our operations

see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  significant events  transactions and conditions product prices 
federal and state regulations there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the oil and gas industry that are often changed in response to the current political or economic environment 
compliance with this regulatory burden is often difficult and costly and may carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
the following are some specific regulations that may affect us 
we cannot predict the impact of these or future legislative or regulatory initiatives 
federal energy bill after failing to pass legislation in  congress is currently considering a new energy bill 
the potential effect of this legislation is unknown  but it is expected to include certain tax incentives for oil and gas producers 
federal regulation of natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation  including transportation rates charged and various other matters  by the federal energy regulatory commission 
federal wellhead price controls on all domestic gas were terminated on january   and none of our gathering systems are currently subject to ferc regulation 
we cannot predict the impact of future government regulation on any natural gas facilities 
although ferc s regulations should generally facilitate the transportation of gas produced from our properties and the direct access to end user markets  the future impact of these regulations on marketing xto s production or on its gas transportation business cannot be predicted 
the company  however  does not believe that it will be affected differently than competing producers and marketers 
federal regulation of oil sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
the net price received from the sale of these products is affected by market transportation costs 
a significant part of our oil production is transported by pipeline 
under rules adopted by ferc effective january  interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index  though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances 
these rules have had little effect on our oil transportation cost 
state regulation oil and gas operations are subject to various types of regulation at the state and local levels 
such regulation includes requirements for drilling permits  the method of developing new fields  the spacing and operations of wells and waste prevention 
the production rate may be regulated and the maximum daily production allowable from oil and gas 
table of contents 
index to financial statements wells may be established on a market demand or conservation basis 
these regulations may limit production by well and the number of wells that can be drilled 
we may become a party to agreements relating to the construction or operations of pipeline systems for the transportation of natural gas 
to the extent that such gas is produced  transported and consumed wholly within one state  such operations may  in certain instances  be subject to the state s administrative authority charged with regulating pipelines 
the rates that can be charged for gas  the transportation of gas  and the construction and operation of such pipelines would be subject to the regulations governing such matters 
certain states have recently adopted regulations with respect to gathering systems  and other states are considering similar regulations 
new regulations have not had a material effect on the operations of our gathering systems  but xto cannot predict whether any further rules will be adopted or  if adopted  the effect these rules may have on its gathering systems 
federal  state or native american leases our operations on federal  state or native american oil and gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions  including nondiscrimination statutes 
such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the bureau of land management  minerals management service and other agencies 
environmental regulations various federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  directly impact oil and gas exploration  development and production operations  and consequently may impact our operations and costs 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
to date  we have not expended any material amounts to comply with such regulations  and management does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of xto

item legal proceedings on october   an action  styled united states of america ex rel 
grynberg v 
cross timbers oil company  et al  was filed in the u 
s 
district court for the western district of oklahoma against us and certain of our subsidiaries by jack j 
grynberg on behalf of the united states under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act 
the plaintiff alleges that we underpaid royalties on gas produced from federal leases and lands owned by native americans in amounts in excess of during at least the past years as a result of mismeasuring the volume of gas and incorrectly analyzing its heating content 
the plaintiff also alleges that we have failed to pay the fair market value of the carbon dioxide produced 
the plaintiff seeks to recover the amount of royalties not paid  together with treble damages  a civil penalty of  to  for each violation and attorney fees and expenses 
the plaintiff also seeks an order for us to cease the allegedly improper measuring practices 
after its review  the department of justice decided in april not to intervene and asked the court to unseal the case 
the court unsealed the case in may a multi district litigation panel ordered that the lawsuits against us and other companies filed by grynberg be transferred and consolidated to the federal district court in wyoming 
we believe that the allegations of this lawsuit are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the action 
any potential liability from this claim cannot currently be reasonably estimated  and no provision has been accrued in our financial statements 
in june  we were served with a lawsuit styled price  et al 
v 
gas pipelines  et al 
formerly quinque case 
the action was filed in the district court of stevens county  kansas  against us and one of our subsidiaries  along with over natural gas transmission companies  producers  gatherers and processors of natural gas 
plaintiffs seek to represent a class of plaintiffs consisting of all similarly situated gas working interest owners  overriding royalty owners and royalty owners either from whom the defendants had purchased natural gas or who received economic benefit from the sale of such gas since january  the allegations in the case are similar to those in the grynberg case  however  the price case broadens the claims to cover all oil and gas leases other than the federal and native american leases that are the subject of the grynberg case 
the complaint alleges that the defendants have mismeasured both the volume and heating content of natural gas delivered into their pipelines resulting in underpayments to the plaintiffs 
plaintiffs assert a breach of contract claim  negligent or intentional misrepresentation  civil conspiracy  common carrier liability  conversion  violation of a variety of kansas statutes and other common law causes of action 
the amount of damages was not specified in the complaint 
in february  we  along with one of our subsidiaries  were dismissed from the suit and another subsidiary of the company was added 
a hearing was held in january  and the court held that a class should not be certified 
plaintiffs counsel has filed an amended class action petition  which reduces the proposed class to only royalty owners  reduces the claims to mismeasurement of volume only  conspiracy  unjust enrichment and accounting  and only applies as to gas measured in kansas  colorado and wyoming 
we believe that the allegations of this lawsuit are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the action 
any potential liability from this claim cannot currently be reasonably estimated  and no provision has been accrued in our financial statements 
on august   the price plaintiffs served one of our subsidiaries with a new original class action petition styled price  et al 
v 
gas pipelines  et al 
the action was filed in the district court of stevens county  kansas  against natural gas pipeline owners and operators 
plaintiffs seek to represent a class of plaintiffs consisting of all similarly situated gas royalty owners either from whom the defendants had purchased natural gas or measured natural gas since january  to the present 
the new petition alleges the same improper analysis of gas heating content  which had previously been alleged in the price case discussed above until it was removed from the case by the filing of the amended class action petition 
in all other respects  the new petition appears to be identical to the amended class action petition in that it has a proposed class of only royalty owners  alleges conspiracy  unjust enrichment and accounting  and only applies as to gas measured in kansas  colorado and wyoming

the action was filed on behalf of all persons who  at any time since june  have been paid royalties on gas produced from any gas well within the state of oklahoma under which we have assumed the obligation to pay royalties 
the plaintiffs alleged that we reduced royalty payments by post production deductions and entered into contracts with subsidiaries that were not arm s length transactions 
the plaintiffs further alleged that these actions reduced the royalties paid to the plaintiffs and those similarly situated  and that such actions were a breach of the leases under which the royalties are paid 
in july  we paid million to settle the plaintiffs claims for the period january  through june  our portion of this liability  net of amounts allocable to hugoton royalty trust units we do not own  was million  which had been accrued in our financial statements 
in february  the department of interior notified us and several other producers that certain native american leases located in the san juan basin had expired because of the failure of the leases to produce in paying quantities from february through august the department of interior demanded abandonment of the property as well as payment of the gross proceeds from the wells minus royalties paid from the date of the alleged cessation of production to present

unless otherwise indicated  throughout this discussion the term mcfe refers to thousands of cubic feet of gas equivalent quantities produced for the indicated period  with oil and natural gas liquid quantities converted to mcf on an energy equivalent ratio of one barrel to six mcf 
all shares and per share data have been adjusted for the five for four stock split to be effected on march  overview our business is to produce and sell natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil from our predominantly southwestern and central us properties  most of which we operate 
because we consider our gathering  processing and marketing as ancillary functions to our production of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil  we have determined that our business comprises only one industry segment 
in  xto energy achieved the following record financial and operating results average daily gas production was million cubic feet  a increase from  and average daily natural gas liquid production was  barrels  a increase from year end proved reserves were trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent  a increase from year end net income was million  a increase from  and earnings per basic common share was  a increase from cash flow from operating activities was million  a increase from stockholders equity was billion  a increase from year end the debt to capitalization ratio was at year end  down from at year end we achieve production and proved reserve growth generally through producing property acquisitions  followed by development 
development activities are generally funded by cash flow from operating activities 
funding sources for our acquisitions include proceeds from sales of public equity and debt  bank borrowings  cash flow from operating activities  or a combination of these sources 
maintaining or improving our debt to capitalization ratio is a primary consideration in selecting our method of acquisition financing 
after considering acquisitions announced through february  our goal for is to increase natural gas production by to 
to achieve future production and reserve growth  we will continue to pursue acquisitions that meet our criteria  and to complete development projects included in our inventory of approximately  potential development drilling locations 
our acquisition budget is million  of which million was spent on acquisitions in january we also entered agreements in february to acquire properties in april for million 
after considering these acquisitions  our development budget is million 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to find properties that meet our acquisition criteria and that we can purchase on acceptable terms 
the weak us dollar  raw material shortages and strong demand for steel in china and europe have tightened worldwide steel supplies  causing prices to rise by more than since november in response  we have increased our tubular inventory and are currently negotiating contracts with our vendors to support our development program 
should steel prices continue to escalate  our development budget could rise by as much as 
while we expect to acquire adequate supplies to complete our development program  a further tightening of steel supplies could restrain the program  limiting our production growth 
sales prices for our natural gas and oil production are influenced by supply and demand conditions over which we have little or no control  including weather and regional and global economic conditions 
to provide predictable production growth  we hedge a portion of our production at prices that ensure stable cash flow margins to fund our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements operating commitments and development program 
as of march   we have hedged approximately half of our projected gas production at an average nymex price of per mcf 
our average realized price on hedged production will be lower than this average nymex price because of location  quality and other adjustments 
the combined effect of higher product prices and a increase in gas production resulted in a increase in total revenues to billion in from million in on an mcfe produced basis  total revenues were in  a increase from in we analyze  on an mcfe produced basis  expenses that generally trend changes in production increase decrease production taxes  transportation and other depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative  excluding non cash incentive compensation interest the increase in taxes  transportation and other expense is primarily because of increased product prices 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased because of higher acquisition and development costs 
the increase in general and administrative expense is because of increased personnel and other costs related to company growth 
significant expenses that generally do not trend with production include non cash incentive compensation 
this is a component of general and administrative expense and primarily relates to the vesting of performance shares when the common stock price reaches specified target levels 
non cash incentive compensation was million in  a increase from the comparable expense of million 
increased incentive compensation is because of the increase in the common stock price during and the resulting increased value of vested awards 
after adjusting for the effect of the april common stock offering  non cash incentive compensation was approximately of the increase in market capitalization of outstanding common shares during each of and including non cash incentive compensation  general and administrative expense increased million  or derivative fair value gain loss 
this is the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  and fluctuates based on changes in the fair value of underlying commodities 
the derivative fair value loss was million in as compared with a gain of million in the loss in is generally related to higher natural gas prices during the year 
accretion of discount in asset retirement obligation 
this expense recognizes the increase  related to the passage of time  in the estimated costs to abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives 
the accretion of discount expense was million in  the first year of its recognition since the related accounting pronouncement was adopted january  our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities  borrowings under our revolving credit facility with commercial banks and public offerings of equity and debt 
in september  moody s assigned to the company an sgl liquidity rating  its highest rating 
in january  standard poors upgraded our corporate credit rating to investment grade and all liens on producing properties and other collateral were irrevocably released as security 
table of contents 
index to financial statements for our revolving credit facility 
as a result  moody s upgraded our existing senior notes to ba from ba and confirmed our ba senior implied rating 
in february  we entered a new revolving credit facility with an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate plus and an initial commitment amount of million which may be increased to billion 
as of february   our borrowings under this facility were million 
under the terms of the agreement  we must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio  as adjusted for certain accounting items  of no more than 
our consolidated financial position and results of operations are significantly affected by our critical accounting policies 
we utilize the successful efforts method of oil and gas accounting  under which we expense the costs of unsuccessful exploratory well costs  as well as exploratory geological and geophysical costs 
all acquisition and development costs are generally capitalized and expensed through depreciation  depletion and amortization  which is computed on the unit of production method 
if conditions indicate our properties may be impaired  we estimate future net cash flows from the applicable properties and compare this estimate to our total net cost of the properties 
if the property cost cannot be recovered from the estimated future cash flows  we must write down the property cost to the discounted present value of such future net cash flows 
to date  our impairment of producing properties has been limited to a million provision recorded in while we do not expect significant impairment provisions in the near future  any prolonged significant decline in commodity prices could require an impairment adjustment to our property cost 
significant events  transactions and conditions the following events  transactions and conditions affect the comparability of results of operations and financial condition for the years ended december   and and may impact future operations and financial condition 
acquisitions

our development and exploration activities are generally funded by cash flow from operating activities 
acquisition  development and exploration program 
we have budgeted billion for our development and acquisition programs  which is expected to be substantially funded by cash flow from operations 
we plan to allocate million of the capital budget to acquisitions  including million of acquisitions in january and million expected to close in april the remaining million is to fund development and exploration projects  approximately of which will be used for exploration 
the cost of property acquisitions may alter the amount currently budgeted for development and exploration 
also  because of recent worldwide steel shortages  our development budget may be increased by as much as 
the total capital budget  including acquisitions  will be adjusted throughout to focus on opportunities offering the highest rates of return 
as of december   we have an inventory of approximately  potential drilling locations 
we plan to drill about net development wells and perform approximately net workovers and recompletions in drilling plans are dependent upon product prices and the availability of drilling equipment 
product prices 
in addition to supply and demand  oil and gas prices are affected by seasonal  political and other conditions we generally cannot control or predict 
gas 
natural gas prices are dependent upon north american supply and demand  which is affected by weather and economic conditions 
natural gas competes with alternative energy sources as a fuel for heating and the generation of electricity 
gas prices were at record highs at the beginning of because of gas supplies strained by winter weather 
throughout the remainder of  prices declined because of fuel switching related to higher prices  milder weather and reduced demand from a weaker economy 
the winter of was one of the warmest on record  resulting in higher than average gas storage levels and lower gas prices in prices climbed in fourth quarter as a result of low levels of drilling activity  increased industrial demand  colder weather and international instability 
with colder than normal weather  record low gas storage levels and continued increasing demand  gas prices remained relatively high during the first five months of with diminished demand related to higher prices  natural gas prices were lower during the summer months  then rose with cooler weather in the fall and early winter 
prices in will continue to be affected by weather  the recovery of the domestic economy  increases in the level of north american production and import levels of liquified natural gas 
in any case  management expects natural gas prices to remain volatile 
as described under hedging activities below  we use commodity price hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to gas price fluctuations 
the following are comparative average gas prices for the last three years year ended december per mcf average nymex price average realized sales price average realized sales price excluding hedging at march   the average nymex gas price for the following months was per mmbtu 
as computed on an energy equivalent basis  our proved reserves were natural gas at december  after considering hedges in place as of march   we estimate that a per mcf increase or decrease in the average gas sales price would result in a million change in annual operating cash flow 
oil 
crude oil prices are generally determined by global supply and demand 
after beginning relatively strong  oil prices declined through the remainder of the year and in because of lagging demand caused by a global recession 
rising uncertainties in the middle east and opec production discipline led to higher prices late in opec members agreed to increase daily oil production million barrels beginning february  to help stabilize 
table of contents 
index to financial statements a volatile world market 
oil prices remained relatively high in  however  because of the war in iraq  slower than anticipated resumption of iraqi oil exports and unusually low storage levels 
opec reiterated its intent to maintain oil prices by reducing daily oil production by million barrels beginning june and by an additional  barrels beginning november in january  a combination of below normal temperatures and low us oil supplies led oil prices to ten month highs  reaching per bbl 
despite increasing demand  opec members agreed to reduce daily oil production by one million barrels beginning april to maintain market balance in the seasonally low demand second quarter 
as described under hedging activities below  we use commodity price hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to oil price fluctuations 
the following are comparative average oil prices for the last three years year ended december per bbl average nymex price average realized sales price average realized sales price excluding hedging at march   the average nymex oil price for the following months was per bbl 
we estimate that a per barrel increase or decrease in the average oil sales price would result in approximately a million change in annual operating cash flow 
hedging activities 
we enter futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts  to hedge our exposure to product price volatility 
our policy is to routinely hedge a portion of our production at commodity prices management deems attractive 
while there is a risk we may not be able to realize the benefit of rising prices  management plans to continue its hedging strategy because of the benefits of more predictable production growth and cash flows 
in  all hedging activities decreased gas revenue by million and decreased oil revenue by million  while in  hedging activities increased gas revenue by million and decreased oil revenue by million 
all hedging activities increased gas revenue by million in the following summarizes our january through december natural gas nymex hedging positions at march   excluding basis adjustments which have been separately hedged 
as of february  our daily gas production was approximately  mcf 
prices to be realized for hedged production will be less than these nymex prices because of location  quality and other adjustments

see note to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities  borrowings against the revolving credit facility  occasional producing property sales including sales of royalty trust units and public offerings of equity and debt 
other than for operations  our cash requirements are generally for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties  and debt and dividend payments 
exploration and development expenditures and dividend payments have generally been funded by cash flow from operations 
we believe that our sources of liquidity are adequate to fund our cash requirements in cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with cash provided by operating activities of million in and million in increased cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily because of increased prices and production from acquisitions and development activity  while decreased cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily because of decreased prices 
cash flow from operating activities was increased by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million in  and was decreased by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million in and million in changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily the result of timing of cash receipts and disbursements 
cash flow from operating activities was also reduced by exploration expense of million in  million in and million in cash flow from operating activities is largely dependent upon the prices received for oil and gas production 
we have hedged approximately half of our projected gas production 
see product prices under significant events  transactions and conditions above 
we do not have any investments in unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
financial condition total assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december   primarily because of company growth related to acquisitions and development 
as of december   total capitalization was billion  of which was long term debt 
capitalization at december  was billion of which was long term debt 
the decrease in the debt to capitalization ratio from year end to is primarily because of our common stock offering in april and earnings for the year 
working capital we generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce bank debt 
short term liquidity needs are satisfied by bank commitments under the loan agreement see financing below 
because of this  and since our principal source of operating cash flows ie  proved reserves to be produced in the following year cannot be reported as working capital  we often have low or negative working capital 
working capital 
table of contents 
index to financial statements decreased from a negative position of million at december  to negative working capital of million at december  excluding the effects of current derivative and deferred tax current assets and liabilities  working capital decreased million 
this decrease is because of increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily related to increased production and drilling liabilities  partially offset by increased revenues 
any cash settlement of hedge derivatives should generally be offset by increased or decreased cash flows from our sales of related production 
therefore  we believe that most of the changes in derivative fair value assets and liabilities are offset by changes in value of our oil and gas reserves 
this offsetting change in value of oil and gas reserves  however  is not recorded in the financial statements 
none of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that could require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date 
when the monthly cash settlement amount under our hedge derivatives is calculated  if market prices are higher than the fixed contract prices  we are required to pay the contract counterparties 
while this payment will ultimately be funded by higher prices received from sale of our production  production receipts lag payments to the counterparties by as much as six weeks 
any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
most of our receivables are from a diverse group of companies including major energy companies  pipeline companies  local distribution companies and end users in various industries 
because of declining credit ratings of some of our customers  we have greater concentrations of credit with a few large integrated energy companies with investment grade ratings 
financial and commodity based futures and swap contracts expose us to credit risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to the contracts 
this exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions 
letters of credit or other appropriate forms of security are obtained as considered necessary to limit risk of loss 
financing on december   borrowings under the revolving credit agreement with commercial banks were million with unused borrowing capacity of million 
the interest rate of at december  is based on the one month london interbank offered rate libor plus 
in february  we replaced our revolving credit agreement with a new five year revolving credit agreement with commercial banks that matures in february the new agreement provides for an initial commitment amount of million  which may be increased to a maximum of billion  and an interest rate based on the libor plus 
the agreement requires us to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of not more than 
in september  moody s assigned to the company an sgl liquidity rating  its highest rating 
in january  standard poors upgraded our corporate credit rating to an investment grade and all liens on producing properties and other collateral were irrevocably released as security for our revolving credit facility 
as a result  moody s upgraded our existing senior notes to ba from ba and confirmed our ba senior implied rating 
our standard poors corporate credit rating is bbb and our moody s credit rating is ba none of our debt agreements have payment acceleration provisions in the event of a decline in our credit ratings 
in june  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to potentially offer securities which could include debt securities  preferred stock  common stock or warrants to purchase debt or stock 
the total face amount of securities that can be offered is billion  at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale 
net proceeds from the sale of such securities will be used for general corporate purposes  including reduction of bank debt 
in january  we sold million of senior notes under the shelf agreement  after which million remains available for future sales of securities 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures in  exploration and development cash expenditures totaled million compared with million in we have budgeted million for the development and exploration program 
as we have done historically  we expect to fund the development program with cash flow from operations 
since there are no material long term commitments associated with this budget  we have the flexibility to adjust our actual development expenditures in response to changes in product prices  industry conditions and the effects of our acquisition and development programs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the weak us dollar  raw material shortages and strong demand for steel in china and europe have tightened worldwide steel supplies  causing prices to rise by more than since november in response  we have increased our tubular inventory and are currently negotiating contracts with our vendors to support our development program 
should steel prices continue to escalate  our development budget could rise by as much as 
while we expect to acquire adequate supplies to complete our development program  a further tightening of steel supplies could restrain the program  limiting our production growth 
our acquisitions budget is million  including million of acquisitions in january and million expected to close in april we plan to fund future property acquisitions with cash flow from operations and bank or public debt 
if our acquisitions exceed million  we expect to fund a portion of our acquisitions with publicly placed equity securities 
there are no restrictions under our revolving credit agreement that would affect our ability to use our remaining borrowing capacity for acquisitions of producing properties 
to date  we have not spent significant amounts to comply with environmental or safety regulations  and we do not expect to do so during however  new regulations  enforcement policies  claims for damages or other events could result in significant future costs 
dividends the board of directors has historically declared quarterly dividends of per outstanding share 
as adjusted for stock splits  the board declared quarterly dividends of per common share for the first quarter  per common share each quarter for the remainder of and and per common share for each quarter of in august  the board also declared a dividend of units of cross timbers royalty trust for each share of our common stock outstanding on september  the market value at the date of distribution was approximately per common share 
in february  the board of directors declared a five for four stock split to be effected on march   as well as a first quarter dividend of per common share 
because of the five for four stock split  this represents a increase in our dividend rate 
our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon available cash flow  as well as other factors 
although there is a cumulative maximum restriction on distributions to common stockholders under our senior note and senior note covenants  because of retained and projected future earnings  we do not anticipate these restrictions will affect future dividend payments 
income taxes as of december   we had estimated tax loss carryforwards of approximately million  of which million are related to capital losses 
the capital loss carryforwards expire in  while the remaining ordinary loss carryforwards are scheduled to expire in through approximately million of the tax loss carryforwards are the result of acquisitions 
we have not booked any valuation allowance because we believe we have tax planning strategies available to realize our tax loss carryforwards 
contractual obligations and commitments the following summarizes our significant obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments as of december  we have not guaranteed the debt or obligations of any other party  nor do we have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt or losses

at december   borrowings were million under our senior bank revolving credit facility due in may in february  we fully repaid this facility and entered a new five year revolving credit agreement with commercial banks that matures in february  as reflected in the table above 
our senior notes  totaling million at december   are due in and in january  we sold million of senior notes which are due in february for further information regarding long term debt  see note to consolidated financial statements 
transportation contracts 
we have entered firm transportation contracts with various pipelines 
under these contracts we are obligated to transport minimum daily gas volumes or pay for any deficiencies at a specified reservation fee rate 
as calculated on a monthly basis  our failure to deliver these minimum volumes to the pipeline requires us to pay the pipeline for any deficiency 
our production committed to these pipelines is expected to exceed the minimum daily volumes provided in the contracts 
we have generally delivered at least minimum volumes under these firm transportation contracts  therefore avoiding payment for deficiencies 
derivative contracts 
we have entered into futures contracts and swaps to hedge our exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations 
as of december   market prices generally exceeded the fixed prices specified by these contracts  resulting in a derivative fair value current liability of million and long term liability of million 
if market prices are higher than the contract prices when the cash settlement amount is calculated  we are required to pay the contract counterparties 
while such payments will be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production  production receipts may be received as much as six weeks after payment to counterparties and can result in draws on our revolving credit facility 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
post retirement plans we have a retiree medical plan that provides retired employees and directors with health care benefits similar to those provided employees 
employees may qualify as a retiree with any combination of age and qualified years of service that total  with a minimum age of and a minimum of five years full time service 
directors are eligible to receive benefits when their combined age and years of service on the board totals  with a minimum age of and a minimum of five years of service 
otherwise  retirement benefits are only provided through our defined contribution k plan 
post retirement medical benefits are not prefunded  but are paid when incurred 
our periodic benefit cost recorded for was million 
future benefit costs will be affected by fluctuations in interest rates and health care cost trends 
we do not currently anticipate that retiree medical plan costs will be significant in relation to the company s future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
related party transactions we have limited related party transactions  as further disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements 
in february  our board of directors approved an agreement with a firm  partially owned by one of our directors  to establish fees that will be paid in connection with any advisory services the firm provides for up to million in future acquisitions 
the agreement is effective as of november for the first acquisition  we will pay a fee of  plus a transaction fee equal to of the purchase price 
for any subsequent acquisition closing  we will pay only the transaction fee 
the initial term of the agreement expires december  to date  we have not paid the director related company any amounts under this agreement 
this same director related company represented the seller of properties for acquisitions totaling approximately million that we closed in january in connection with our sale of properties in  the same director related company represented the purchaser and also invested in the purchase 
we invested  in a limited partnership that purchased a small interest in these properties 
based on an impairment evaluation in  we have written down this investment to  during  the same director related company performed consulting services in connection with our acquisition of properties in east texas  louisiana and the san juan basin of new mexico 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the director related company received a fee of million for these services  which was of the total of the property purchase price and the related exchange transaction value 
the same director related company performed consulting services in connection with a acquisition and was entitled to receive  at its election  either a working interest or a overriding royalty interest conveyed from our working interest in the properties after payout of acquisition and operating costs 
the board of directors

index to financial statements authorized the purchase of this potential interest from the director related company and other parties in november for million  as supported by a third party fairness opinion 
the director related company received million of the total purchase price 
critical accounting policies our financial position and results of operations are significantly affected by accounting policies and estimates related to our oil and gas properties  proved reserves  asset retirement obligation and commodity prices and risk management  as summarized below 
oil and gas property accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies may elect to account for their property costs using either the successful efforts or full cost accounting method 
under the successful efforts method  unsuccessful exploratory well costs  as well as all exploratory geological and geophysical costs  are expensed 
under the full cost method  all exploration costs are capitalized  regardless of success 
selection of the oil and gas accounting method can have a significant impact on a company s financial results 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting and generally pursue acquisitions and development of proved reserves as opposed to exploration activities 
property costs that exceed management s estimate of future cash flows of proved reserves must be expensed through an impairment provision 
we evaluate possible impairment of producing properties  generally aggregated on a field level basis  when conditions indicate that they may be impaired 
cash flow pricing estimates are based on existing proved reserve and production information and pricing assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
individually significant undeveloped properties are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis  and impairment of other undeveloped properties is done on a total basis 
our impairment of producing properties has been limited to a million provision recorded in our impairment provisions have been limited  and we do not expect significant impairment provisions in the near future  because of our relatively low acquisition and development costs compared with expected product prices 
by comparison  full cost companies must record impairment under a ceiling test which is computed on an aggregate country basis using discounted estimated future after tax cash flows based on current market prices 
this generally results in more frequent and higher impairment provisions under the full cost method when prices decline significantly 
oil and gas reserves our proved oil and gas reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof 
estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
because proved reserves are required to be estimated using prices at the date of the evaluation  estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices 
accordingly  oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different from previous estimates 
proved reserves  as defined by the financial accounting standards board and adopted by the securities and exchange commission  are limited to reservoir areas that indicate economic producibility through actual production or conclusive formation tests  and generally cannot extend beyond the immediately adjoining undrilled portion 
although improved technology often can identify possible or probable reserves other than by drilling  these reserves cannot be estimated and disclosed 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of producing properties is computed on the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
if estimated proved reserves decline  future dd a expense will increase and net income will be reduced 
a decline in proved reserves also can result in a required impairment provision  as discussed under oil and gas property accounting above 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows  as reported in note to consolidated financial statements  are prepared using assumptions required by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
such assumptions include using year end oil and gas 
table of contents 
index to financial statements prices and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures 
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a rate 
changes in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the standardized measure 
accordingly  the standardized measure does not represent management s estimated current market value of proved reserves 
asset retirement obligation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties including removal of our offshore platforms in alaska at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to producing properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive life of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long life of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from previous estimates 
commodity prices and risk management commodity prices significantly affect our operating results  financial condition  cash flows and ability to borrow funds 
current market oil and gas prices are affected by supply and demand as well as seasonal  political and other conditions which we generally cannot control 
oil and gas prices and markets are expected to continue their historical volatility 
see significant events  transactions and conditions product prices above 
we attempt to reduce our price risk by entering into financial instruments such as futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts 
while these instruments secure a certain price and  therefore  a certain cash flow  there is the risk that we will not be able to realize the benefit of rising prices 
these contracts also expose us to credit risk of nonperformance by the contract counterparties  all of which are major investment grade financial institutions 
we attempt to limit our credit risk by obtaining letters of credit or other appropriate forms of security 
we also have sold call options as part of our hedging program 
call options  however  do not provide a hedge against declining prices  and there is the risk that the call sales proceeds will be less than the benefit a higher sales price would have provided 
while our price risk management activities decrease the volatility of cash flows  they may obscure our operating results and financial condition 
as required under generally accepted accounting principles  we adopted sfas no 
on january  with a significant charge to our income statement and equity related to recording derivative financial instruments at their market value 
subsequent to that date  we recorded significant derivative fair value gains in the income statement and equity related to decline in natural gas prices 
in each instance  these are projected gains and losses to be realized upon settlement of these contracts in subsequent periods when related production occurs 
these gains and losses are generally offset by increases and decreases in the market value of our proved reserves  which are not reflected in the financial statements 
derivatives that provide effective cash flow hedges are designated as hedges  and  to the extent the hedge is determined to be effective  we defer related unrealized fair value gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction occurs 
because hedge accounting is not required under generally accepted accounting principles  our operating results as reflected in our financial statements may not be comparable to other companies 
see item a  commodity price risk for the effect of price changes on derivative fair value gains and losses

index to financial statements accounting pronouncements an issue within the oil and gas industry has recently arisen regarding whether sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  require costs associated with mineral rights be accounted for and separately reported on the balance sheet as intangible assets 
as is the common practice in the oil and gas industry  we include leasehold acquisition costs as a component of both producing properties and undeveloped properties on our consolidated balance sheets 
this question of sfas no 
and sfas no 
applicability has been referred to the financial accounting standards board 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
and sfas no 
require intangible asset accounting treatment for costs associated with mineral rights  the following amounts would be reclassified on the consolidated balance sheets from producing properties  undeveloped properties and accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization december in thousands intangible assets producing property leasehold acquisition costs undeveloped property leasehold acquisition costs total leasehold acquisition costs accumulated depletion net leasehold acquisition costs accounting for the costs of mineral rights as intangible assets under sfas no 
and sfas no 
would also require additional financial statement disclosures but would not affect our method of amortization or assessment of impairment 
therefore  any resulting accounting change would have no effect on our consolidated income statements or statements of cash flows 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
such financial instruments include mandatorily redeemable shares of stock  obligations to repurchase the issuer s equity shares and obligations that an issuer may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  in november  the effective date for sfas no 
was deferred for provisions relating to certain financial instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries 
none of our consolidated entities currently have any of these financial instruments  and we do not anticipate sfas no 
will have a material effect on future financial position or earnings 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revision of interpretation no 
to clarify consolidation requirements for variable interest entities 
we do not anticipate this interpretation to have an effect on our financial statements since we do not have interests in variable interest entities 
also in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 revising disclosures required about pensions and other post retirement benefits 
these revised disclosures are included in note to consolidated financial statements for our post retirement health plan 
in accordance with a deferred effective date  future annual reporting will disclose future plan benefit payments expected to be paid for each of the five years following the latest balance sheet date and in the aggregate for the following five years 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued staff position no 
regarding treatment in post retirement health plan accounting and disclosures for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act  which was signed by the president into law in december because our post retirement health plan does not provide prescription drug coverage beyond the date of eligibility for medicare coverage  this change in medicare coverage does not impact estimates for our benefit costs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements production imbalances we have gas production imbalance positions that are the result of partial interest owners selling more or less than their proportionate share of gas on jointly owned wells 
imbalances are generally settled by disproportionate gas sales over the remaining life of the well  or by cash payment by the overproduced party to the underproduced party 
we use the entitlement method of accounting for natural gas sales 
accordingly  revenue is deferred for gas deliveries in excess of our net revenue interest  while revenue is accrued for the undelivered volumes 
production imbalances are generally recorded at the estimated sales price in effect at the time of production 
the consolidated balance sheets include the following amounts related to production imbalances december in thousands amount mcf amount mcf accounts receivable current underproduction accounts payable current overproduction net current gas underproduction balancing receivable other assets noncurrent underproduction other long term liabilities noncurrent overproduction net long term gas overproduction balancing payable other assets carbon dioxide underproduction net long term overproduction balancing payable forward looking statements certain information included in this annual report and other materials filed or to be filed by us with the securities and exchange commission  as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us  contain projections and forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended  relating to our operations and the oil and gas industry 
such forward looking statements may be or may concern  among other things  capital expenditures  cash flow  drilling activity  drilling locations  acquisition and development activities  production and reserve growth  pricing differentials  reserve potential  operating costs  operating margins  production activities  oil  gas and natural gas liquids reserves and prices  hedging activities and the results thereof  liquidity  debt repayment  regulatory matters and competition 
such forward looking statements are based on management s current plans  expectations  assumptions  projections and estimates and are identified by words such as expects  intends  plans  projects  predicts  anticipates  believes  estimates  goal  should  could  assume  and similar words that convey the uncertainty of future events 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially from expectations  estimates  or assumptions expressed in  forecasted in  or implied in such forward looking statements 
some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed below 
oil and gas price fluctuations 
our results of operations depend upon the prices we receive for our oil and gas 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
we routinely hedge a portion of our production to reduce the effects of price volatility see hedging arrangements below 
otherwise  the prices we receive depend upon factors beyond our control  including political instability in oil producing regions  weather conditions  ability of opec to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels  consumer demand  worldwide economic conditions and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
moreover  government regulations  such as regulation of gas transportation and price controls  can affect product prices in the long term 
these external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to reliably estimate future prices of oil and gas 
to the extent we have not hedged our production  any decline in oil and gas prices adversely affects our financial condition 
if the oil and gas industry experiences significant price declines  we may  among other things  be unable to meet our financial obligations or make planned capital expenditures 

table of contents 
index to financial statements debt level 
we have substantial debt and may incur more 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing production from existing reserves or developing new reserves  we may lack the funds to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations 
our indebtedness also affects our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and may preclude pursuit of other business opportunities 
capital requirements 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  development  production  exploration and abandonment of our oil and gas reserves 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and public offerings of equity and debt 
lower oil and gas prices  however  may reduce cash flow available to pay down bank borrowings or other debt 
competitive industry 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we compete with major oil companies  independent oil and gas businesses  and individual producers and operators 
in addition  there is competition from alternative energy sources  such as heating oil  imported liquified natural gas and other fossil fuels 
many of our competitors have financial  technological and other resources substantially greater than ours 
these companies may be able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
our ability to develop and exploit our oil and gas properties and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations  implement advanced technologies  evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
reserve replacement 
our success depends upon finding  acquiring and developing oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we are able to successfully explore for  develop or acquire proved reserves  our proved reserves will decline through depletion and our financial assets and annual revenues will decline unless prices substantially increase 
we cannot assure the success of our exploration  development and acquisition activities 
hedging arrangements 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas  we currently and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements for a portion of our oil and gas production 
these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including when production is less than expected  the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations  or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreements and actual prices received 
in addition  these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for oil and gas 
reserve estimates 
estimating our proved reserves involves many uncertainties  including factors beyond our control 
petroleum engineers consider many factors and make assumptions in estimating oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows 
lower oil and gas prices generally cause lower estimates of proved reserves 
ultimately  actual production  revenues and expenditures relating to our reserves will vary from any estimates  and these variations may be material 
acquiring producing properties 
we constantly evaluate opportunities to acquire oil and gas properties and frequently engage in bidding and negotiation for these acquisitions 
if successful in this process  we may alter or increase our capitalization through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities  the sale of production payments or other measures 
any change in capitalization affects our risk profile 
acquisitions may also alter the nature of our business 
this could occur when the character of acquired properties is substantially different from our existing properties in terms of operating or geologic characteristics 
drilling activities 
our drilling activities subject us to many risks  including the risk that we will not find commercially productive reservoirs 
drilling for oil and gas can be unprofitable  not only from dry wells  but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit 
also  title problems  weather conditions  governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services can delay our drilling operations or result in their cancellation 
shortages of equipment  including pipe  can lead to a delay or suspension of drilling and can significantly increase the cost of drilling 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain  and we cannot assure that new wells will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
marketability of production 
the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
any significant change in market factors affecting 
table of contents 
index to financial statements these infrastructure facilities could harm our business 
we deliver some of our oil and gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
these facilities may not be available to us in the future 
growth through acquisitions 
our business strategy has emphasized growth through strategic acquisitions  but we may not be able to continue to identify properties for acquisition or we may not be able to make acquisitions on terms that we consider economically acceptable 
there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry 
competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of  or cause us to refrain from  completing acquisitions 
our strategy of completing acquisitions is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and  in some cases  regulatory approvals 
our ability to pursue our growth strategy may be hindered if we are not able to obtain financing or regulatory approvals 
our ability to grow through acquisitions and manage growth will require us to continue to invest in operational  financial and management information systems and to attract  retain  motivate and effectively manage our employees 
the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations  which  in turn  could negatively impact our earnings and growth 
our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period  based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 
government regulations 
extensive federal  state and local regulation of the oil and gas industry significantly affects our operations 
in particular  our oil and gas exploration  development and production  and our storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons  are subject to stringent environmental regulations 
these regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning oil and gas wells and other related facilities 
these regulations may become more demanding in the future 
we may need to expend significant financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental regulations and permitting requirements 
although we believe that our operations generally comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may incur substantial additional costs and liabilities in our operations as a result of stricter environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies 
operating hazards and uninsured risks 
our operations are subject to inherent hazards and risks  such as fire  explosions  blowouts  formations with abnormal pressures  uncontrollable flows of underground gas  oil and formation water and environmental hazards such as gas leaks and oil spills 
any of these events could cause a loss of hydrocarbons  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of operations  personal injury claims  loss of life  damage to our properties  or damage to the property of others 
in addition  our liability for environmental hazards may include conditions created by the previous owners of properties that we purchase or lease or by acquired companies prior to the date we acquire them 
as protection against operating hazards  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses 
we do not believe that insurance coverage for all environmental damages that could occur is available at a reasonable cost 
we believe that our insurance is adequate and customary for companies of similar size and operation  but losses could occur for uninsured risks or in amounts exceeding existing coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we only enter derivative financial instruments in conjunction with our hedging activities 
these instruments principally include commodity futures  collars  swaps and option agreements and interest rate swap agreements 
these financial and commodity based derivative contracts are used to limit the risks of fluctuations in interest rates and natural gas and crude oil prices 
gains and losses on these derivatives are generally offset by losses and gains on the respective hedged exposures 
our board of directors has adopted a policy governing the use of derivative instruments  which requires that all derivatives used by us relate to an underlying  offsetting position  anticipated transaction or firm commitment  and prohibits the use of speculative  highly complex or leveraged derivatives 
the policy also requires review and approval by the chairman  the executive vice president administration and the senior vice president marketing of all risk management programs using derivatives and all derivative transactions 
these programs are also reviewed at least quarterly by our internal risk management committee and annually by the board of directors 
hypothetical changes in interest rates and prices chosen for the following estimated sensitivity effects are considered to be reasonably possible near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in interest rates and product prices 
accordingly  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on short term and long term debt carrying variable interest rates 
at december   our variable rate debt had a carrying value of million  which approximated its fair value  and our fixed rate debt had a carrying value of million and an approximate fair value of million 
we attempt to balance the benefit of lower cost variable rate debt that has inherent increased risk with more expensive fixed rate debt that has less market risk 
this is accomplished through a mix of bank debt with short term variable rates and fixed rate senior and subordinated debt  as well as the occasional use of interest rate swaps 
the following table shows the carrying amount and fair value of long term debt and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a basis point change in interest rates 
unless otherwise noted  the hypothetical change in fair value could be a gain or a loss depending on whether interest rates increase or decrease 
in thousands carrying amount fair value a hypothetical change in fair value december  long term debt december  long term debt a fair value is based upon current market quotes and is the estimated amount required to purchase our long term debt on the open market 
this estimated value does not include any redemption premium 
commodity price risk we hedge a portion of our price risks associated with our crude oil and natural gas sales 
as of december   we had outstanding gas futures contracts  swap agreements and gas basis swap agreements 
these contracts and agreements had a net fair value loss of approximately million at december  and a net fair value loss of million at december  of the december  fair value  a million loss has been determined based on the exchange trade value of nymex contracts and a million gain has been determined based on the broker bid and ask quotes for basis contracts 
these fair values approximate amounts confirmed by the counterparties 
as of december   we had no outstanding oil futures contracts and differential swaps 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical change in gas prices would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of gas futures contracts and swap agreements at december  none of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral

see note to consolidated financial statements 
because most of our futures contracts and swap agreements have been designated as hedge derivatives  changes in their fair value generally are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the related sale of production occurs 
at that time  the realized hedge derivative gain or loss is transferred to product revenues in the consolidated income statement 
we had a physical delivery contract to sell  mcf per day from through july at a price of approximately of the average nymex futures price for intermediate crude oil 
because this gas sales contract was priced based on crude oil  which is not clearly and closely associated with natural gas prices  it was accounted for as a non hedge derivative financial instrument 
this contract referred to as the enron btu swap contract was terminated in december in conjunction with the bankruptcy filing of enron corporation 
in november  we entered derivative contracts to effectively defer until and any cash flow impact related to  mcf of daily gas deliveries in that were to be made under the enron btu swap contract 
the net fair value loss on these contracts at december  was million 
the effect of a hypothetical change in gas prices would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of these contracts  while a change in crude oil prices would result in a change of approximately million
