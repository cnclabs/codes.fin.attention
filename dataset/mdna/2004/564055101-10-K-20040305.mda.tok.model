item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview manor care  inc  which we also refer to as manor care or hcr manor care  provides a range of health care services  including skilled nursing care  assisted living  subacute medical and rehabilitation care  rehabilitation therapy  hospice care  home health care  and management services for subacute care and rehabilitation therapy 
long term care 
the most significant portion of our business relates to long term care  including skilled nursing care and assisted living 
on december   we operated skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities in states with percent of our facilities located in florida  illinois  michigan  ohio and pennsylvania 
within some of our centers  we have medical specialty units which provide subacute medical and rehabilitation care and or alzheimer s care programs 
the table below details the activity in the number of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities and beds during the past three years 
the additions represent facilities built  acquired  leased or transferred out of assets held for sale 
the divestitures include facilities that were sold or closed 
we are selling certain facilities that no longer fit our strategic growth plan 
we expect to divest five facilities in the first half of  and their results of operations are insignificant to us 
we currently have two skilled nursing facilities under construction  which we expect to open in we have not included in the table any activity related to managed facilities or expansion of beds in existing facilities 
facilities beds facilities beds facilities beds skilled nursing facilities additions divestitures assisted living facilities additions divestitures 
table of contents hospice and home health 
our hospice and home health business includes all levels of hospice care  home care and rehabilitation therapy with offices in states 
the growth in our hospice and home health business is primarily a result of opening additional offices and expansion of our hospice client base in existing markets where we benefit from our long term care relationship 
we also had growth from small acquisitions 
health care services 
we provide rehabilitation therapy in our skilled nursing centers and our outpatient therapy clinics  as well as in hospitals and schools  serving the midwestern and mid atlantic states  texas and florida 
we provide program management services for subacute care and acute rehabilitation programs in hospitals and skilled nursing centers 
on april   we completed the sale of our mesquite  texas acute care hospital to health management associates  inc  or hma  for million in cash 
separately  we invested million to acquire percent of the hma entity owning the hospital 
the total gain on the sale of the hospital was million 
we recorded a pretax gain of million and deferred million  or percent  of the gain 
simultaneously  we acquired for million a percent interest in an hma entity that had recently acquired another hospital in mesquite  texas 
other services 
we have one remaining long term management contract with a physician practice  specializing in vision care 
in  we decided that our vision management business was no longer a long term strategy  which resulted in the writedown of intangible assets and the termination of one of the contracts 
we also terminated a contract in we are a majority owner of a medical transcription company that converts medical dictation into electronically formatted patient records 
health care providers use the records in connection with patient care and other administrative purposes 
medicare and medicaid payment changes under the budget act 
government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid prescribe  by law  the billing methods and amounts that may be charged and reimbursed to care for patients covered by these programs 
on august   congress enacted the balanced budget act of  or the budget act  which sought to achieve a balanced federal budget by  among other things  reducing federal spending on medicare and medicaid 
the budget act contained numerous changes affecting medicare and medicaid payments to skilled nursing facilities  home health agencies  hospices and therapy providers  among others 
medicare reimbursed skilled nursing facilities retrospectively for cost reporting periods that began before july  under this system  each facility received an interim payment during the year 
the skilled nursing facility then submitted a cost report at the end of each 
table of contents year  and medicare adjusted the payment to reflect actual allowable direct and indirect costs of services 
the budget act changed the medicare payment system to a prospective system in which medicare reimburses skilled nursing facilities at a daily rate for specific covered services  regardless of their actual cost  based on various categories of patients 
the medicare program phased in this prospective payment system over three cost reporting periods beginning on or after july  the budget act also required a prospective payment system to be established for home health services  which began october  in addition  the budget act reduced payments to many providers and suppliers  including therapy providers and hospices  and gave states greater flexibility to administer their medicaid programs by repealing the federal requirement that payment be reasonable and adequate to cover the costs of efficiently and economically operated nursing facilities 
federal medicare payment legislation 
in november  congress passed the medicare  medicaid and schip balanced budget refinement act of  or bbra in addition  in december  congress passed the medicare  medicaid  and schip benefits improvement and protection act of  or bipa both bbra and bipa redressed certain reductions in medicare reimbursement resulting from the budget act 
further refinements also were made by the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  or mma  which was signed into law december  several provisions of these recent bills positively affected us  beginning primarily in the latter half of these provisions included a temporary increase in the payment for certain high cost nursing home patients  for services provided beginning april  bipa amended this provision to redistribute the amounts applicable to rehabilitation patients from three specific categories to all rehabilitation categories 
this temporary increase will continue at least until the secretary of the department of health and human services implements a refined patient classification to better account for medically complex patients 
the secretary did not implement such refinements in fiscal year president bush s proposed fiscal year budget indicates that the refinements will not be adopted in fiscal year specific services or items  such as ambulance services in conjunction with renal dialysis  chemotherapy items and prosthetic devices  furnished on or after april   may be reimbursed outside of the prospective payment system daily rate 
a two year moratorium on the annual  therapy cap indexed for inflation on each of physical speech therapy and occupational therapy beginning with services provided on or after january  bipa amended this provision  extending the moratorium through december  the per beneficiary limits  which were adjusted for inflation to  were imposed 
table of contents beginning september  mma suspends application of the therapy caps from december  through calendar year a delay in the percent reduction in the base payment level for our home health business until october bipa further amended this provision  extending the delay through september  certain of the increases in medicare reimbursement for skilled nursing facilities provided for under bbra and bipa expired on september   the so called medicare cliff 
congress has not enacted additional legislation to date to further extend these provisions 
no assurances can be given as to whether congress will increase or decrease reimbursement in the future  the timing of any action or the form of relief  if any  that may be enacted 
we offset the decrease in revenues from the medicare cliff by a shift in the mix of our patients to a higher percentage of medicare patients 
the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  skilled nursing facility payment update rule for fiscal provided a percent inflation update 
there was also an administrative action which provided an additional percent rate increase designed to make up for certain previous forecast error underpayments 
both increases were effective october  labor 
labor costs consist of wages  temporary nursing staffing and payroll overhead  including workers compensation 
labor costs account for approximately percent of the operating expenses of our long term care segment 
our long term care wage rate increases in were approximately percent  the lowest rate of increase in over three years 
we decreased our temporary staffing expenses  as well as workers compensation expense  in see additional discussion of workers compensation under critical accounting policies 
we compete with other health care providers to attract and retain qualified or skilled personnel 
we also compete with various industries for lower wage employees 
although we currently do not face a staffing shortage in all markets where we operate  we have used high priced temporary help to supplement staffing levels in markets with shortages of health care workers 
since  we have implemented additional training and education programs  which have helped with retention of employees 
our temporary staffing costs for our long term care segment decreased by percent between and and over percent between and if a shortage of nurses or other health care workers occurred in all geographic areas in which we operate  it could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and could further increase our operating costs 
general and professional liability costs 
patient care liability is still a serious industry wide cost issue 
the health care industry is making progress in state legislatures and at the national level to enact tort reform 
with tort reform and our proactive management initiatives  our number of new claims and average settlement cost per claim have stabilized 
during  strong tort reform legislation capping medical malpractice awards was passed in texas and upheld by a state constitutional amendment 
other key states made a start at 
table of contents meaningful tort reform 
the long term care industry received some assistance with the passage of a measure of tort reform in florida in may that became fully effective on october  the industry had not been included in previously passed tort reform in florida that benefited other health care providers 
the legislation that was passed included caps on punitive damages  limits to add on legal fees  tougher rules of evidence and a reduced statute of limitations 
while we cannot insure that legislative changes will have a positive impact on the current trend  we believe that this could be an important step in reducing the long term care industry s current litigation burden  particularly if the florida legislature acts to tighten these provisions with additional legislation 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 
receivables and revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when the related patient services are provided 
the revenues are based on established daily or monthly rates adjusted to amounts estimated to be received under governmental programs and other third party contractual arrangements 
receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by us to be the net realizable value 
no individual customer or group of customers accounts for a significant portion of our revenues or receivables 
certain classes of patients rely on a common source of funds to pay the cost of their care  such as the federal medicare program and various state medicaid programs 
medicare program revenues for the years prior to the implementation of the prospective payment system and certain medicaid program revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by government representatives 
we believe that any differences between the net revenues recorded and final determination will not materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor type  historical collection trends and aging categories 
we calculate our reserve for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the percentage that we apply to the receivable balances in the various aging categories is based on our historical experience and time limits  if any  for each particular pay source  such as private  insurance  medicare and medicaid 

table of contents impairment of property and equipment and intangible assets 
we evaluate our property and equipment and intangible assets on a quarterly basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or the life of the asset may need to be changed 
we consider internal and external factors of the individual facility or asset  including changes in the regulatory environment  changes in national health care trends  current period cash flow loss combined with a history of cash flow losses and local market developments 
if these factors and the projected undiscounted cash flow of the entity over its remaining life indicate that the asset will not be recoverable  the carrying value will be adjusted to its fair value if it is lower 
if our projections or assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for our assets 
general and professional liability 
we purchase general and professional liability insurance and have maintained an unaggregated self insured retention per occurrence ranging from million to million  depending on the policy year and state 
our general and professional reserves include amounts for patient care related claims and incurred but not reported claims 
the amount of our reserves is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data 
the estimation process requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of the claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about emerging trends  we along with our independent actuary develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on our historical experience and other available industry information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in costs  the expected cost of claims incurred but not reported and the expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
our assumptions take into consideration our internal efforts to contain our costs by reviewing our risk management programs  our operational and clinical initiatives  and other industry changes affecting the long term care market 
we also monitor the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior year estimation process and adjust our current year assumptions accordingly 
we evaluate the adequacy of our general and professional liability reserves with our independent actuary semi annually 
we do see an improving trend in terms of patient liability costs 
the number of new claims in is similar to  despite some acceleration around tort related legislative activity in texas and to some degree in florida 
our average settlement cost per claim has decreased in comparison to the prior year 
after our independent actuarial review that was completed in the fourth quarter  it was determined that we would lower our accrual rate by approximately million on a quarterly basis 
we expect our accrual for current claims per month to be million through our policy period ending may  at december  and  our general and professional liability consisted of short term reserves of million and million  respectively  and long term reserves of million and million  respectively 
the expense for general and professional liability claims  premiums and administrative fees was million  million and million for the years ended 
table of contents december   and  respectively 
although we believe our liability reserves are adequate  we can give no assurance that these reserves will not require material adjustment in future periods 
workers compensation liability 
our workers compensation reserves are determined based on an estimation process that uses company specific data 
we continuously monitor the claims and develop information about the ultimate cost of the claims based on our historical experience 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in costs  the expected costs of claims incurred but not reported and the expected future costs related to existing claims 
our assumptions take into consideration our internal efforts to contain our costs with safety and training programs 
in addition  we review industry trends and changes in the regulatory environment 
we recorded additional expense of million in in comparison to  primarily because of an increase in the average cost per claim 
with the expansion and increased attention to our safety and training programs  our new claims decreased in  resulting in a decrease of million in our workers compensation expense in comparison to at december  and  the workers compensation liability consisted of short term reserves of million and million  respectively  and long term reserves of million and million  respectively 
although we believe our liability reserves are adequate  we can give no assurance that these reserves will not require material adjustment in future periods 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
our revenues increased million from to excluding the results of our hospital that we sold in  revenues increased million  or percent  compared with revenues from our long term care segment increased million  or percent  primarily due to increases in rates patient mix million and occupancy million that were partially offset by a decrease in capacity million 
our revenues from the hospice and home health segment increased million  or percent  primarily because of an increase in hospice patient days 
our rate increases for the long term care segment related only to medicaid and private pay sources 
our average medicaid rate increased percent from per day in to per day in we expect our average medicaid rate to increase about percent in due to state budgetary constraints 
our average private and other rates for our skilled nursing facilities increased percent from per day in to per day in the increase in overall rates was also a result of the shift in the mix of our patients to a higher percentage of medicare patients  even though the average medicare rate decreased percent from per day in to per day in the rate decreased because certain increases in medicare reimbursement for skilled nursing facilities provided for under bbra and bipa expired on september   the so called medicare cliff 
the rate reduction from the medicare cliff was partially offset by the increase in rates in the fourth quarter of as a result of inflationary increases and to make up for previous cms forecast 
table of contents error underpayments 
in the fourth quarter of  our average medicare rate was per day  an increase of per day over the third quarter of our occupancy levels increased from percent for to percent for excluding start up facilities  our occupancy levels were percent for and percent for our occupancy levels for skilled nursing facilities were percent for and percent for in the fourth quarter of  our skilled nursing occupancy increased to percent 
our bed capacity declined between and  primarily because we sold three facilities in see our table in the overview 
the quality mix of revenues from medicare  private pay and insured patients related to long term care facilities and rehabilitation operations remained constant at percent for and operating expenses 
our operating expenses increased million from to excluding the results of our hospital that was sold in  operating expenses in increased million  or percent  compared with during the second quarter of  we recorded an expense of million for a proposed settlement of a review of certain medicare cost reports filed by facilities of manor care of america  inc  or mca the former manor care  inc  prior to the implementation of the prospective payment system 
this review  which was conducted by the department of justice and the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  focused primarily on nursing cost allocations made in reliance upon instructions from the facilities medicare fiscal intermediary for the period we believe the mca facilities were fully entitled to the reimbursement they received for these allocations 
the agreement in principle  if ultimately approved and executed by all parties  will resolve any uncertainty over potential liability to the medicare program 
we have fully cooperated with the department of justice throughout the review 
no complaint has been filed  nor has any subpoena been issued to us related to this matter 
this agreement in principle is subject to final approvals within the department of justice and to negotiation of a definitive settlement agreement 
we expect the settlement to be completed in the near future 
operating expenses from our long term care segment increased million  or percent  from to the largest portion of the long term care operating expense increase of million related to labor costs 
our other operating expense increase for this segment included ancillary costs  excluding internal labor  of million 
ancillary costs  which include various types of therapies  medical supplies and prescription drugs  increased as a result of our more medically complex patients 
the expense related to our stock appreciation rights increased million because of the increase in our stock price during the year 
our long term care general and professional liability expense increased million from to our expense included million of additional expense due to a court ordered liquidation of one of our insurers 
the corresponding reserve represents our estimated costs for claims in to that may not be covered by government emergency recovery funds 
the million increase  excluding the additional expense in  related to an increase in 
table of contents the claims accrual and insurance premiums 
refer to our overview and critical accounting policies for additional discussion of our general and professional liability costs 
operating expenses from our hospice and home health segment increased million  or percent 
the increase related to labor costs of million  ancillary costs including pharmaceuticals of million and other direct nursing care costs  including medical equipment and supplies  of million 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased million compared with the significant expense in related to the increase in costs associated with our stock appreciation rights and deferred compensation plans 
the increase in these costs included in general and administrative expenses was million and primarily resulted from an increase in our stock price of over percent 
the increase in costs related to stock appreciation rights and deferred compensation plans was recorded in both general and administrative expenses and operating expenses 
the total increase for these expenses was million 
in  we recorded a million charge related to the restructuring of our split dollar insurance arrangements which fund one of our senior executive retirement plans 
under these arrangements  the officers are owners of the life insurance policies subject to an assignment to manor care of an interest in the policy cash value equal to the premiums paid by us 
because of the possible interpretation that our future payment of premiums on these policies would be considered a prohibited loan under the sarbanes oxley act of  we suspended future premium payments following the passage of that act 
policy dividend values are currently being used to pay the required portion of the annual premiums 
in addition  under the split dollar assignment agreements  the transaction with mca in required us to set aside cash for future premium payments or to reallocate a portion of the corporate interest in the policies 
as the sarbanes oxley act may prohibit additional funding by manor care  we committed to reallocate million of our interest in the policy cash surrender values to the various officer policies  upon officer retirement 
this reallocation increased our accrued liability  resulting in a charge of million 
in  we also terminated our split dollar arrangements covering an executive life insurance program and transferred our share of the split dollar life insurance polices to the officers and key employees 
this action resulted in a charge of million and was taken to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of and contractual requirements  as well as to address recent tax law changes that make the internal buildup of cash surrender value taxable 
the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses primarily related to wages  consulting expenses and other general inflationary costs 

table of contents asset impairment 
during our quarterly reviews of long lived assets in  management determined that certain assets were impaired by million 
the impairment consisted of million for long term care facilities  million for non strategic land parcels  million for assets held for sale and million for our vision business 
management assesses quarterly whether its long term care facilities are impaired 
we consider indicators of impairment to be either market conditions or negative cash flows 
the various market conditions include the litigation environment  deterioration of the areas in which the facilities are located  deteriorating state government reimbursement  condition of the physical plant and excess bed capacity 
during the spring of  we engaged in a portfolio management review 
our new portfolio management strategy included evaluating as divestiture targets older assets  poor or declining financial performers  geographically isolated facilities with lower per diem revenues  facilities operating in a state with low medicaid reimbursement  and facilities in states with punitive regulatory survey and or an unfavorable litigation climate 
we also looked at alternatives for moving beds from underperforming facilities to locations where demand would fill them or combining assets of locations in the same geography into a single location 
the long term care facilities that were impaired as part of this strategy included seven skilled nursing facilities and three assisted living facilities 
of these  various market conditions were considered which resulted in the impairment of eight facilities 
these impairments were based on management s judgment and independent real estate broker valuations 
the remaining two facilities had a history of negative cash flows for more than three years 
the results of operations could not be improved even after changing facility management several times 
we closed three of the facilities and are currently looking at alternatives for the other seven facilities 
we may continue to operate the facilities  sell the facilities as currently operated or sell the facilities for alternative uses 
the carrying values of the facilities were reduced by million to their estimated fair values of million 
the estimated fair values were determined based on comparable sales values 
the carrying values of land parcels exceeded their estimated fair values by million 
the fair values were based on estimated sales values under current market conditions 
during  we received offers on all of our assisted living facilities that had been held for sale 
the offers  less the cost to sell  were less than our carrying values on of these facilities and required us to write down the asset values by million to their estimated fair values of million 
we sold two of the texas facilities in the fourth quarter of the remaining facilities did not have final purchase agreements at december  and  accordingly  were no longer held for sale 
because the writedown of the assets to fair value was in excess of the depreciation that we would have recorded on these facilities  we did not have to recognize a retroactive depreciation adjustment when the facilities were transferred to property and equipment 
this transfer required us to reverse million of expense previously recorded for estimated selling costs 
we continued to successfully operate these facilities at december  
table of contents we decided that our vision business was no longer a long term strategy 
because of this decision  our non compete and management contracts were impaired and written down by million in the second quarter 
the fair value of the management contracts was determined based on a discounted cash flow or a multiple of projected earnings 
we terminated one of our vision management contracts in the third quarter of  requiring a writedown of the remaining fair value of million 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million from to because of the higher interest rates associated with our fixed rate senior notes issued in april compared with our variable rate credit agreement debt that was paid off 
the increase in interest expense also related to additional amortization of finance fees from the new senior notes 
we also entered into interest rate swap agreements in may on a notional amount of million to hedge certain fixed rate senior notes 
these agreements effectively converted the interest rates of these notes to variable rates in order to provide a better balance of fixed and variable rate debt 
these agreements reduced our interest expense by million in gain on sale of assets 
our gain on the sale of assets in primarily resulted from the sale of non strategic land parcels and sale of securities 
our gain on the sale of assets in primarily related to a million gain recognized on the sale of our hospital 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies 
our equity earnings increased million compared with  primarily because of our ownership interests in two hospitals acquired on april  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that we adopted january  under this statement  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we completed our initial impairment test in the second quarter of and determined that million of our goodwill related to our vision business was impaired 
the impairment loss  with no tax effect  was recorded retroactive to january  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
inflation 
we believe that inflation has had no material impact on our results of operations 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
our revenues increased million from to excluding the results of our hospital that we sold in  revenues increased million  or percent  compared with revenues from our long term care segment increased million  or 
table of contents percent  primarily due to increases in rates patient mix million and capacity million 
our revenues from the hospice and home health business increased million  or percent  primarily because of an increase in hospice services 
our rate increases for the long term care segment related to medicare  medicaid and private pay sources 
our average medicare rate increased percent from per day in to per day in  primarily due to inflationary increases 
the medicare rate increase was offset by the expiration of certain rate increases from bbra and bipa on september   the so called medicare cliff 
because of the net effect of inflationary increases and the medicare cliff  our medicare rates in the fourth quarter of were reduced by per patient day compared with the third quarter to per day 
the related revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in the volume of medicare patients 
our average medicaid rate increased percent from per day in to per day in our average private and other rates for our skilled nursing facilities increased percent from per day in to per day in the increase in overall rates was also a result of the shift in the mix of our patients to a higher percentage of medicare patients 
our bed capacity increased between and  primarily because of the transfer of assisted living facilities out of held for sale  as well as the timing of opening or closing facilities see our table in the overview 
assets held for sale were not included in our long term care segment in our occupancy levels were percent for and when excluding start up facilities  our occupancy levels were percent for and our occupancy levels for skilled nursing facilities were percent for and in the third and fourth quarter of  our skilled nursing occupancy was percent 
the quality mix of revenues from medicare  private pay and insured patients related to long term care facilities and rehabilitation operations remained constant at percent for and operating expenses 
our operating expenses increased million from to excluding the results of our hospital that was sold in  operating expenses in increased million  or percent  compared with operating expenses from our long term care segment increased million  or percent 
operating expenses from our hospice and home health business increased million  or percent  because of an increase in services 
we attribute the largest portion million of the long term care operating expense increase between and to wages  temporary staffing and payroll overhead  including workers compensation 
our other operating expense increase for this segment included ancillary costs  excluding internal labor  of million 
ancillary costs  which include various types of therapies  medical supplies and prescription drugs  increased as a result of our more medically complex patients 
our long term care general and professional liability expense decreased from million in to million in our expense included million of additional expense 
table of contents due to a court ordered liquidation of one of our insurers  as discussed previously 
our expense included million for our current policy periods and million for a change in estimate on policy periods prior to june refer to our overview for additional discussion of our general and professional liability costs 
we had an additional long term care operating expense of million in the fourth quarter of related to the damage award from the arbitration decision with neighborcare pharmacy services  or neighborcare 
on february   a decision was rendered in an arbitration hearing between neighborcare  an institutional pharmacy services subsidiary of neighborcare  inc  formerly known as genesis health ventures  inc  and us 
the decision denied our right to terminate our neighborcare supply agreements before their expiration on september  subsequently  we entered into new agreements that expire on january  the decision required us to pay damages and certain related amounts of approximately million to neighborcare for profits lost  as well as prejudgment interest of million  as a result of their being precluded from supplying other facilities of ours 
the estimated interest cost of million was recorded in interest expense 
during  we reversed million of the million charge that was recorded in based on an amendment to the decision and award dated june  we paid million in see discussion of the interest expense portion of the award below 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased million compared with in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to the restructuring of our split dollar insurance arrangements  as discussed previously 
excluding this charge  general and administrative expenses approximated percent of revenues and increased million from the prior year 
the increases related to general inflationary costs that were partially offset by decreases in costs for deferred compensation plans and stock appreciation rights 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation remained constant in comparison to the prior year 
the increase in depreciation for our new construction projects and renovations of existing facilities was offset by the decline in depreciation of million from the sale of our hospital and writedown of asset values due to impairment  as discussed previously 
amortization decreased million from to because we no longer amortize goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the change in accounting principle for goodwill 
interest expense 
when excluding capitalized interest and interest from the arbitration decision with neighborcare  our interest expense decreased million compared with because of lower interest rates and debt levels 
we accrued million of interest expense in the fourth quarter of related to the neighborcare arbitration decision and reversed million in the second quarter of due to an amended arbitration decision 

table of contents equity in earnings of affiliated companies 
our equity earnings increased million compared with because of our pharmacy partnership and recent ownership interest in two hospitals 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our hospital investments 
on july   we paid in full a million revolving line of credit  which we guaranteed  of a development joint venture 
as a result of the repayment  we were assigned the full rights and privileges of the lenders  including security interests in alzheimer s assisted living facilities 
during  we reached a settlement with all joint venture parties and received title to the facilities 
we consolidated the results of these facilities in the third quarter of and classified them as held for sale 
during the first half of prior to our consolidation  we recorded equity losses of million related to this development joint venture 
we were a percent owner in a partnership that sold its only nursing home in june during the second quarter of  we reversed million of previously recorded losses for this partnership 
these losses were booked in excess of our investment because we had guaranteed the partnership s debt  which was paid off with the sale of the nursing home 
income taxes 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to the final resolution with the internal revenue service  or irs  for corporate owned life insurance  or coli 
in november  we received a notice from the irs denying interest deductions on policy loans related to coli for the years through we agreed to a final coli settlement with the irs for an estimated million including interest  which allowed us to retain a portion of these deductions 
we paid million in additional taxes in related to the coli settlement with the irs 
inflation 
we believe that inflation has had no material impact on our results of operations 
financial condition december  and net property and equipment decreased million  primarily due to depreciation of million and disposal of assets of million 
these decreases were partially offset by million in new construction and renovations to existing facilities and a million cash payment to exercise a purchase option on a leased facility 
employee compensation and benefits increased million with half of the increase related to the accrual for stock appreciation rights and the remainder due to accruals for wages and vacation 
accrued insurance liabilities increased million  primarily due to an increase in our general and professional liability accrual that was offset by an million payment of an 
table of contents environmental liability 
we also received insurance proceeds of million in january  which reduced our receivables and offset half of the environmental payment 
income tax payable decreased million  primarily due to the tax benefit for the exercise of stock options 
our debt classification between current and long term changed during as a result of the financing package completed in april 
we issued million of senior notes 
with the proceeds  we paid off our expiring revolving credit facility that had a balance of million at december  and was classified as a current liability 
our long term deferred income taxes increased million  primarily because of additional tax depreciation 
the increased tax depreciation resulted from changes in tax laws that created additional first year depreciation and a review that resulted in a change to the tax classification and depreciable lives of our assets 
new accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
the interpretation 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of the interpretation fin r 
the interpretation introduces a new consolidation model  referred to as the variable interests model  which determines control and consolidation based on who absorbs the majority of the potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being evaluated for consolidation  rather than who has the majority of voting ownership rights 
we do not currently have investments in any variable interest entities 
therefore  the adoption of fin r did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity cash flows 
during  we satisfied our cash requirements with cash generated from operating activities 
we used the cash principally for capital expenditures  acquisitions  the purchase of our common stock and the payment of dividends 
cash flows from operating activities were million for  an increase of million from it was not necessary to pay any estimated federal tax payments in compared with million in due to changes in tax laws and tax accounting methods for return purposes 
investing activities 
our expenditures for property and equipment of million in included million to construct new facilities and expand existing facilities 
in the first quarter of  we exercised a purchase option for million on a facility that was previously leased 

table of contents debt agreements 
during april  we refinanced our five year  million revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to mature september  the financing package included a new three year million revolving credit facility  million of senior notes due in and million of originally issued at convertible senior notes due in the net proceeds of approximately million from the closing of these transactions were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our five year revolving credit facility and to purchase million of our common stock concurrent with the refinancing transactions 
as of december   there were no loans outstanding under the new three year revolving credit facility  and  after consideration of usage for letters of credit  there was million available for future borrowing 
our three year credit agreement requires us to meet certain measurable financial ratio tests  to refrain from certain prohibited transactions such as certain liens  larger than permitted dividends  stock redemptions and asset sales  and to fulfill certain affirmative obligations such as paying taxes when due and maintaining properties and licenses 
we met all covenants at december  none of our debt agreements permit the lenders to determine in their sole discretion that a material adverse change has occurred and either refuse to lend additional funds or accelerate current loans 
our and senior note agreements contain a clause that is triggered if we were to have a change of control that is immediately followed by a downgrade in debt rating by either standard poor s ratings service or moody s investors service  inc if a change of control were followed by a rating agency downgrade  we are obligated to offer to redeem the and senior notes 
as long as we offer to make such redemption  we will have satisfied the conditions of the and senior notes 
stock purchase 
during through  our board of directors authorized us to spend up to million to purchase our common stock  with million of the authorization expiring on december  and the remaining million on december  with these authorizations  we purchased  shares in for million  which includes the million repurchased concurrently with the convertible senior notes offering 
we had million remaining authority to repurchase our shares as of december  we may use the shares for internal stock option and k match programs and for other uses  such as possible acquisitions 
cash dividends 
in july  we declared our first quarterly dividend of cents per share of common stock 
our dividends of cents per common share in totaled million 
in january  our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend to cents per share to shareholders of record on february  this dividend payment will approximate million that is payable february  we intend to declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends  however  there can be no assurance that any dividends will be declared  paid or increased in the future 

table of contents contractual obligations 
the following table provides information about our contractual obligations at december  payments due by years after total in thousands debt including interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases internal construction projects deferred acquisition costs total the debt obligation includes the principal payments and interest payments through the maturity date 
for variable rate debt and variable rate payment obligations under our interest rate swap agreements  we have computed our obligation based on the rates in effect at december  until maturity 
for our convertible senior notes  we are including the principal payment and assuming interest is paid through the first date the holders can require us to redeem the notes april  
unless the market value of the convertible senior notes declines by more than percent from its value at december   the holders of the notes would receive less by requiring us to redeem the debt than from selling the notes on the market 
the operating lease obligation includes the annual operating lease payments on our corporate headquarters that reflect interest only on the lessor s million of underlying debt obligations  as well as a residual guarantee of that amount at the lease maturity in at the maturity of the lease  we will be obligated to either purchase the building by paying the million of underlying debt or vacate the building and cover the difference  if any  between that amount and the then fair market value of the building 
we believe that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover operating needs  future capital expenditure requirements  scheduled debt payments of miscellaneous small borrowing arrangements and capitalized leases  cash dividends and some share repurchase 
because of our significant annual cash flow  we believe that we will be able to refinance the major pieces of our debt as they mature 
it is likely that we will pursue growth from acquisitions  partnerships and other ventures that we would fund from excess cash from operations  credit available under our bank credit agreement and other financing arrangements that are normally available in the marketplace 

table of contents commitments and contingencies letters of credit 
we had total letters of credit of million at december   which benefit certain third party insurers and bondholders of certain industrial revenue bonds  and percent of these letters of credit were related to recorded liabilities 
environmental liabilities 
one or more subsidiaries or affiliates of mca have been identified as potentially responsible parties in a variety of actions relating to waste disposal sites that allegedly are subject to remedial action under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation liability act  or cercla  and similar state laws 
cercla imposes retroactive  strict joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties for the costs of hazardous waste clean up 
the actions arise out of the alleged activities of cenco  incorporated and its subsidiary and affiliated companies 
cenco was acquired in by a wholly owned subsidiary of mca 
the actions allege that cenco transported or generated hazardous substances that came to be located at the sites in question 
environmental proceedings may involve owners and or operators of the hazardous waste site  multiple waste generators and multiple waste transportation disposal companies 
these proceedings involve efforts by governmental entities or private parties to allocate or recover site investigation and clean up costs  which costs may be substantial 
we cannot quantify with precision the potential liability exposure for currently pending environmental claims and litigation  without regard to insurance coverage  because of the inherent uncertainties of litigation and because the ultimate cost of the remedial actions for some of the waste disposal sites where mca is alleged to be a potentially responsible party has not yet been determined 
at december   we had million accrued in other long term liabilities based on our current assessment of the likely outcome of the actions  which was reviewed with our outside advisors 
at december   there were no insurance recoveries receivable 
general and professional liability 
we are party to various other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business  including patient care related claims and litigation
