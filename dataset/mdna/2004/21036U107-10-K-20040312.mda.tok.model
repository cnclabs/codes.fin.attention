item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a manufacturer of pet plastic containers for food and beverages 
approximately of its revenues were generated in the united states with the remainder attributable to its european operations 
during  one customer accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated revenues  while the top ten customers accounted for an aggregate of of sales during the year 
over of the company s sales relate to conventional pet containers which are primarily used for carbonated soft drinks and bottled water 
these products generally carry low margins 
profitability is driven principally by volume and maintaining efficient manufacturing operations 
in recent years  the largest growth within conventional products has come from bottled water and increased sales of smaller  single serve soft drink bottles 
the company believes that in the long run  profitability from bottled water may decline as economic factors force some water bottlers into self manufacturing of pet bottles and some smaller water bottlers out of business 
in addition to the conventional product lines  the company is also a producer of higher margin custom products which are used in such packaging applications as hot fill beverages  food  beer and flavored alcoholic beverages  most of which require containers with special performance characteristics 
critical success factors in the custom pet market include technology  design capabilities and expertise with specialized equipment 
the technology required to produce certain types of custom products is commonly available  which has resulted in increased competition and lower margins for such products 
the pet packaging industry is experiencing an intensely competitive pricing environment 
the company expects that price erosion will continue 
excess production capacity is one factor that causes price pressure 
another factor is customer consolidation  which can increase the leverage that customers bring to bear in contract negotiations with the company  or immediately entitle customers to more favorable prices charged to the acquirer 
customer consolidations have recently occurred  and the company expects that such consolidation will reduce the profits attributable to those customers involved 
in addition  many of the company s contracts contain provisions that permit customers to terminate their contracts if the customer receives an offer from another manufacturer that the company chooses not to match 
this makes price competition a constant concern  not just an issue that arises upon contract renewal 
the company continues to focus its efforts on effective cost controls  manufacturing efficiencies and overhead reductions in an effort to offset these competitive pressures 
the primary raw material and component cost of the company s products is pet resin which is a commodity available globally 
the price of pet resin is subject to frequent fluctuations as a result of oil prices  overseas markets and seasonal demand 
substantially all of the company s customer contracts contain provisions that allow for the pass through of changes in the price of pet resin 
constar is one of the largest purchasers of pet resin in north america  which it believes provides it with negotiating leverage necessary to obtain resin at favorable prices 
however  higher resin prices may impact the company s sales where customers have a choice between pet and other forms of packaging 
pet bottle manufacturing is capital intensive  requiring both specialized production equipment and significant support infrastructure for power  high pressure air and resin handling 
the company believes that the introduction of new pet technologies has created significant opportunities for the conversion of glass containers to pet containers for bottled teas  beer  flavored alcoholic beverages and food applications 
these conversion opportunities will require significant capital expenditures to obtain the appropriate production equipment 
constar s ability to make capital expenditures is limited by the covenants contained in its credit agreement discussed below 
if constar is awarded a significant volume of conversions over a short period of time  the company may have to obtain waivers or amendments to these covenants 
in negotiations with certain customers for new business and the extension of current business  the company has agreed to price concessions 
the company currently estimates these price concessions to average 
table of contents approximately million to million annually for each of the next three to five years 
the company is currently in the process of improving its manufacturing processes  updating existing facilities and investing in new technologies in an effort to offset these price concessions with reductions in the cost to manufacture its products 
if the company is not successful in its efforts to reduce its manufacturing costs associated with these products  the company s gross profit will likely be adversely affected 
the company is highly leveraged 
the company s debt structure consists of a million revolving loan  million term loan  million second lien term loan and million of publicly held senior subordinated notes 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under the revolving loan and was fully drawn on the other instruments 
net interest expense for the year ended december  was million  and there is a mandatory paydown of the million term loan of approximately million for fiscal certain of the debt instruments contain customary affirmative and negative covenants  including covenants related to operating performance and financial leverage 
certain of these covenants were amended during fiscal to reflect the company s recent downturn in operating performance and lowered expectations for future increased profitability 
however  these covenants were not amended beyond the period ending june  therefore  even if the company achieves its revised business plan  constar will be required to obtain additional amendments in the future or will be required to seek alternative financing from new lenders or through asset sales 
relationship with crown constar was a wholly owned subsidiary of crown from until the closing of constar s initial public offering on november  at december   crown owned  shares  or  of the company s common stock 
during  the following executive officers of crown served on constar s board of directors john w 
conway  chief executive officer  frank j 
mechura  executive vice president americas division  and alan w 
rutherford  chief financial officer 
on december   mr 
conway and mr 
rutherford resigned from the company s board of directors 
the company s historical costs and expenses include charges from crown for certain centralized corporate services and for the use of crown s infrastructure 
these allocations were based on methodologies that crown believed to be reasonable and are consistent with charges made to other crown operations  however  these allocations may not be indicative of constar s future expenses 
certain of these services that had been provided by crown prior to the company s initial public offering are now provided by the company s current employees  some of whom were crown employees 
in addition  the company has a services agreement with crown under which it receives certain services from crown 
the services provided by crown under the services agreement include payroll  systems for accounting  reporting  tax  information technology  benefits administration and logistics 
see note of the accompanying notes to combined and consolidated financial statements 
assuming that  throughout the term of the services agreement  constar does not purchase any optional services from crown  it does not terminate any of the services to be initially provided by crown and costs do not increase due to outsourcing of services by crown  we expect the cost of the services  using currency exchange rates as of february   to be approximately  per month from january through november and approximately  in december the company s historical expenses also include a technology fee of approximately of net sales assessed by crown cork seal technologies corporation cck technologies  a wholly owned subsidiary of crown 
in exchange for this fee  cck technologies provided constar with access to cck technologies intellectual property related to pet  paid for direct costs related to the company s research  development and engineering activities  provided the company with legal services related to the defense of constar s rights to certain technologies  and provided the company with support for customer claims resolution  supplier qualifications  spoilage reduction and product and material specifications 
upon completion of constar s initial public offering and the contribution of certain technology from cck technologies to the company  this arrangement with cck technologies was discontinued and constar s technology and research and development requirements were thereafter met by hiring 
table of contents pet research and development staff from crown  by outsourcing with unrelated third party providers  and through a research and development agreement with cck technologies 
during the third quarter of  the company ceased outsourcing research and technology to cck technologies 
the company cannot make assurances that the fees charged to it by crown under the services agreement reflect the costs of obtaining these services from a third party or of providing these services internally or that these costs will not deviate from the company s estimated costs 
these agreements were negotiated in the context of a parent subsidiary relationship and are not on arm s length terms 
however  constar believes that purchasing these services from crown for some period of time is the most efficient way to maintain constar s operations as it transitions to third party or internal services 
prior to the completion of the company s initial public offering  crown charged the company interest expense on the net average intercompany indebtedness the company owed to crown based on the average actual interest costs to crown 
the company believes the methodology that was used to calculate this charge was reasonable but may not be indicative of the company s current and future expenses as an independent entity 
on october   constar distributed to crown a note in the principal amount of million 
prior to the completion of the company s initial public offering  the company s other intercompany indebtedness to crown was capitalized 
in addition  concurrent with the closing of the company s initial public offering on november   the company issued million of senior subordinated notes due notes at of their principal amount and also entered into a million senior secured credit agreement  consisting of a million seven year term loan term b loan and a million five year revolving loan facility revolver loan 
the company used the proceeds from the notes and the term b loan along with million of borrowings under the revolver loan to repay the company s note to crown 
since the completion of the company s initial public offering  crown has been operating constar s equipment in salt lake city  utah and voghera  italy on the company s behalf under manufacturing and supply agreements  and crown supplies constar with bottles produced by crown s faba sirma facility in parma  italy 
in addition  the company is supplying crown with closure components produced by the company s facility in newark  ohio and has been providing technical services to some of crown s joint ventures in the pet preform and container manufacturing business 
in addition  constar has granted crown a non exclusive  royalty free license to use oxbar technology in products not manufactured with pet and has agreed to share with crown royalties that the company earns from licensing oxbar to third parties 
these agreements were negotiated in the context of a parent subsidiary relationship and are not on arm s length terms 
the faba and voghera agreements expired on december  and extensions are being negotiated 
since its initial public offering  the company has rented space from crown for the company s principal executive offices at the rate of approximately thousand per month 
the lease agreement expired on december  and an extension is being negotiated 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and acquisitions and significant items affecting the results of operations impairment of goodwill effective january   constar adopted the provisions of sfas no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life 
instead  fas requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life be reviewed for impairment upon adoption of fas and annually thereafter 
under fas  goodwill is deemed to be potentially impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 

table of contents during the second quarter of  constar completed its transitional impairment review of identified reporting units and recognized an impairment charge in its european reporting unit of approximately million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  due to the trading price of the company s common stock  operating results that reflect lower volumes of domestic conventional product sales related to weather conditions  increased handling and shuttling costs and other factors  the company determined that a goodwill impairment existed as of june  based on a preliminary assessment  the company recognized an estimated impairment charge of million in the second quarter of the fair value of the company was determined by quoted market prices of the company s common stock plus a control premium 
in accordance with fas  the company performed a detailed analysis of the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities  including obtaining appraisals for fixed assets and intangibles  during the third quarter of based on the results of this analysis  the company was not required to make any adjustments to the estimated impairment charge of million as recorded during the second quarter ended june  restructuring and asset impairments in september  the company announced its plans to implement a cost reduction initiative under which it closed two facilities in birmingham  alabama and reserve  louisiana 
under the plan  approximately positions were to be eliminated at the affected facilities and production at these locations was to be relocated to other manufacturing facilities 
as a result of this initiative  the company recognized restructuring provisions of approximately million and non cash asset impairment charges of approximately million during the restructuring provisions consisted of approximately million for severance and termination benefits for both facilities and approximately million for contract and lease termination costs 
as of december   both facilities had ceased manufacturing operations and a majority of the employees had been terminated 
certain manufacturing equipment has been relocated to other plants  and additional items will be moved during the first six months of see note of the accompanying notes to combined and consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
acquisition on september   the company acquired certain manufacturing assets from carolina packaging  inc and entered into a ten year supply agreement with privately held pepsi bottler carolina canners  inc carolina canners for million 
based on final asset appraisals  the entire purchase price was allocated amongst the machinery and equipment acquired in this transaction 
in addition  the company agreed to purchase on hand inventory of approximately million  which was used to supply carolina canners subsequent to the acquisition 
refinancing on december   in order to provide for temporary relief from certain covenants and improve short term liquidity  the company obtained a million second lien term loan second lien loan due december net of fees and expenses of approximately million  the proceeds from the second lien loan were used to prepay million of the term b loan with the remainder used to paydown a portion of amounts outstanding under the revolver loan 
in connection with this refinancing  certain of the financial covenants contained within these debt agreements were amended through the quarter ended june  also  the paydown on the term b loan resulted in a permanent reduction in the principal outstanding while the revolver loan s total availability was reduced from million to million 
beginning october   the company must maintain at least million in borrowing availability under the revolver loan for at least consecutive days between each october and january of the subsequent year 

table of contents basis of presentation net sales the company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped and the title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers  returns  and other adjustments are netted against sales in the same period that the related sales are recorded 
pet containers can be sold either as finished bottles or as preforms 
preforms are test tube shaped intermediate products in the manufacturing process for bottles and are purchased by customers or other pet container manufacturers that operate equipment to convert preforms into bottles 
unit selling prices for preforms are lower than unit selling prices for corresponding finished bottles because of their lower added value 
in the united states  the company s customers typically buy finished bottles  while its european customers typically buy preforms 
from year to year  the composition of the company s portfolio of products sold changes significantly due to changes in the company s customer base  changes in the mix of products presented to the marketplace by its customers  and by incremental opportunities for preform sales 
greater proportions of larger  heavier or more specialized bottles will lead to higher net sales  even if total unit volumes remain stable 
many of the company s products have seasonal demand characteristics typically resulting in higher sales and profits in the second and third quarters compared to the first and fourth quarters 
sales of single service convenience beverage bottles are strongest in the summer months 
in  the company experienced unusually low seasonal demand due to poor weather  slow economic conditions and disruptions in the turkish market as a result of the threat of war 
during the first half of  the company experienced lower shipments of conventional products and increased competitive pricing conditions which were partly offset by increased sales of custom products and the contractual pass through to customers of higher resin prices 
in addition  unfavorable weather conditions exacerbated the lower domestic demand for the company s conventional products 
some potential high growth product categories are developed first in conjunction with seasonal promotions and in stadium and special events markets 
all of constar s sales are subject to marketing actions taken by customers as they adjust their mix of product presentations 
the potential for continued conversion to pet from metal  glass and other packaging materials is an important determinant of future demand in the company s industry 
constar believes that the potential for continued conversions to pet is significant 
as is common in its industry  the company s contracts are generally requirements based  granting it all or a percentage of the customer s actual requirements for a particular period of time  instead of a specific commitment of unit volume 
substantially all of constar s customer contracts contain provisions permitting it to pass through the changes in the price of resin  our principal raw material and a major component of cost of goods sold 
when the company adjusts its prices under these agreements to pass through changes in resin prices  its net sales change accordingly but its gross margin is unaffected 
in the aggregate  the lag between effective date of resin price changes and the effective date of price adjustments to its customers under various pass through mechanisms is approximately equal to the company s inventory exposure 
in  approximately of the company s net sales were recorded in currencies other than in us dollars 
because sales denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars in constar s financial statements using the average exchange rates for the period  net sales reported in its financial statements that are denominated in foreign currencies will fluctuate as a result of variations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
cost of products sold  excluding depreciation cost of products sold  excluding depreciation includes raw material costs  principally pet resin  other direct and indirect manufacturing costs and shipping and handling costs 
pet resin is the largest component of cost of 
table of contents products sold 
the prices the company pays for pet resin are subject to frequent fluctuations resulting from cost changes in the raw materials for pet  which are affected by prices of oil and its derivatives in the us and overseas markets  normal supply and demand influences  and seasonal demand effects 
direct and indirect manufacturing costs include labor costs  electricity and other utilities  product handling and storage costs  maintenance expense and other fixed and variable expenses required to operate the company s plants 
the company s cost of products sold also includes expenses for the engineering  production control and manufacturing administration activities that support plant operations 
depreciation property  plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis for financial reporting purposes over the estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging from to years 
typical depreciation periods are years for molds  years for machinery and equipment and years for buildings 
gross profit the company defines gross profit as net sales less cost of products sold and depreciation expense 
as discussed above  the company s agreements with customers typically have provisions that insulate gross profit from changes in resin prices by allowing the company to pass those changes through to its customers with equivalent price changes for its products 
important determinants of profitability are volume  product mix  and competitive pricing in relation to resin cost 
volume is significant because the capital intensity of pet bottle manufacturing and the highly automated manufacturing process make fixed overhead costs a high percentage of cost of products sold excluding raw materials 
constar s various products have widely different proportions of variable cost in relation to fixed cost because of their different sizes and weights and because of the different technologies and machine types used to manufacture them 
this results in significant differences in the volume effect on profitability for different products 
generally  larger  heavier  and more technologically specialized bottles have higher overhead absorption rates  and therefore have proportionately greater effect on gross profit when volumes vary from period to period 
although price pass through mechanisms can generally protect profits from short term changes in the market price for resin  it is largely the competitive conditions in the market for the company s products that ultimately determine the selling prices for its products 
also important to the company s profitability is its ability to operate its plants and distribution system efficiently 
the company operates most of its equipment seven days per week and hours per day  with a formal program for scheduled weekly  monthly  and annual preventative maintenance activities 
constar s ability to operate equipment at high output levels and with low unscheduled downtime affects its profitability directly as a result of labor efficiency and the cost of additional freight if product must be shipped from more distant plants to meet commitments to its customers 
the company ships mostly full truckload quantities to its customers using commercial carriers 
because resin represents a large component of cost of products sold and since the company typically passes through changes in resin prices to its customers  constar believes that period to period comparisons of its gross profit as a percent of net sales may not accurately reflect performance  as changes in net sales caused by changes in resin prices will not change gross profit 
during periods when resin costs are high the company s net sales will tend to rise but there will be little effect on gross profit 
the opposite is true during periods of low resin pricing  the company s net sales will tend to be lower with little or no decrease in gross profit  causing gross margins to increase 

table of contents amortization of goodwill this consists of the amortization of goodwill which arose from crown s acquisition of constar in and has been amortized on a straight line basis over years 
on january   the company adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requiring that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
selling and administrative expense this includes compensation and related expenses for employees in the selling and administrative functions as well as other operating expenses not directly related to manufacturing or research  development and engineering activities 
it does not include depreciation and amortization charges 
crown historically provided the company with certain centrally managed services as discussed below in the management charges section 
charges for these services are classified as management charges through the closing of the company s initial public offering on november  since the closing date  the company has fulfilled these services with internal resources  third parties  or through its transition services agreement with crown 
management charges prior to the closing of the company s initial public offering on november   crown charged the company certain management fees for payroll  benefits administration  purchasing  information systems and other centrally managed services 
the cost of these services was directly charged and or allocated to the company using a method that crown and the company believed was reasonable 
such charges were not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the company had been a separate entity 
constar s financial results reflect these management charges through the closing of the company s initial public offering on november  since november   the company has provided these services with its own resources or continued to receive them through services agreements with crown 
all expenses for these services are included in administrative expense 
research and technology expense prior to the closing of the company s initial public offering on november   the company paid cck technologies  a wholly owned subsidiary of crown  a charge approximately equal to of sales 
in return  cck technologies provided the company with access to cck technologies intellectual property related to pet  paid for the company s direct costs of research  development and engineering activities  provided the company with legal services for the defense of rights for existing technologies  and provided the company with support for customer claims resolution  supplier qualifications  spoilage reduction  and product and material specifications 
as of november   this arrangement was discontinued  and the company s requirements were thereafter met by hiring pet research and development staff from crown  by outsourcing with unrelated third party providers  and through a research and development agreement with cck technologies 
during the third quarter of  the company ceased outsourcing research and technology to cck technologies 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate on income or loss was in compared to in a reconciliation of the provision for income taxes and the amount of income tax determined by applying the us federal statutory rate of to pretax income or loss is presented in note to the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements 
interest expense crown charged the company interest based on the average actual interest costs to crown on the net average intercompany indebtedness 
the company believes that the methodology used to calculate this charge was 
table of contents reasonable but not necessarily indicative of interest expense that would have been incurred if the company had been a standalone entity 
subsequent to the company s initial public offering  interest expense reflects the increase in average debt outstanding pertaining to the senior secured credit agreement and the senior subordinated notes 
other expenses  net other expenses  net include operating expenses not included elsewhere  such as write offs pertaining to property  plant and equipment  and bad debt expense offset against income items such as gains on sales of used equipment 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting the reported results of operations and financial position of the company 
the company s significant accounting principles are more fully described in note to the combined and consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies  however  are considered to be critical in that i they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and ii their application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired  the company performs an impairment review by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  to its carrying value 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and judgments including the identification of the appropriate reporting units and the calculation of fair value 
the company uses a combination of market values for comparable businesses and discounted cash flow projections to calculate fair value 
if the company s share price and operating results sustain an extended decline  this could trigger an impairment review 
the company s estimates of future cash flows includes assumptions concerning future operating performance  economic conditions  and technological changes and may differ from actual future cash flows 
during the second quarter of  the company recognized an impairment charge of million due to the trading price of the company s common stock  operating results that reflected lower volumes of domestic conventional product sales  increased handling and shuttling costs  and other factors 
long lived assets  which consist primarily of machinery and equipment  buildings  construction in progress and land  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market price of long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or a history of operating cash flow losses associated with use of the asset 
when such events or changes occurs  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use and  if applicable  the eventual disposition of the assets 
the key variables that the company must estimate include assumptions regarding future sales volume  prices and other economic factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables  and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
if such assets are considered impaired  they are written down to fair value as appropriate 
accounting for pensions and postretirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including discount rate  rate of return on plan assets  compensation increases  health care cost increases  mortality and employee turnover 
actual results may differ from the company s actuarial assumptions  which may have an impact on the amount of reported expense or liability for pensions or postretirement benefits 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed at each measurement date based on the 
table of contents pension plans investment policies and an analysis of the historical returns of the capital markets  adjusted for current interest rates as appropriate 
for  the company is using an expected rate of return on plan assets of in the us which is unchanged from the discount rate is developed at each measurement date by reference to published indices of high quality bond yields 
a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have changed us pension expense by approximately  a change in the discount rate would have changed us pension expense by approximately  and postretirement expense by approximately  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience and known factors regarding specific customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
the company writes down its inventories for estimated slow moving and obsolete goods by amounts equal to the difference between the carrying cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
the effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
management provides valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets for amounts  which are not considered more likely than not to be realized 
the company maintains reserves for estimated costs associated with its workers compensation and health insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for health insurance 
the company s insurers are the direct payors of workers compensation claims and the company is obligated to reimburse the insurers for any payments made 
the company utilizes historical experience and recent expense rates to estimate the reserves necessary for these areas 
if an increased level of claims in excess of current estimates were to occur  additional reserves would be required

the act expands medicare  primarily by adding a prescription drug benefit for medicare eligibles starting in the act provides employers currently sponsoring prescription drug programs for medicare eligibles with a range of options for coordinating with the new government sponsored program potentially to reduce program cost 
these options include supplementing the government program on a secondary payor basis or accepting a direct subsidy from the government to support a portion of the cost of the employer s program 
in connection with this act  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of which permits a company that provides prescription drug benefits to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of this act 
pursuant to this guidance  constar has chosen to defer recognition of the potential effects of the act in our financial statements 
this decision was made largely due to the number of open questions about select provisions of the act and a lack of authoritative accounting guidance concerning certain technical matters 
therefore  the postretirement benefit obligations and costs reported in this financial statement do not yet reflect any potential impact of the act 
specific  authoritative guidance on the accounting for the government subsidy is still pending 
once issued  the guidance will define the specific transition accounting requirements that may require companies to change their current accounting 
results of operations compared to net sales dollars in millions increase decrease united states europe total net sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in in the us  net sales increased million  or to million in when compared to million in in europe  net sales increased million  or  to million in from million in net sales in the us accounted for of net sales in compared to of net sales in in the us  the primary items that impacted net sales in as compared to were increased sales of custom products and the contractual pass through to customers of higher resin prices primarily offset by lower shipments of conventional products and competitive pricing conditions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk in the normal course of business  constar is exposed to fluctuations in currency values  interest rates  commodity prices and other market risks 
the company derived approximately of total revenues from sales in foreign currencies during the year ending december  in the company s financial statements operating results in local currency are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates during the period and balance sheet items are translated at rates on the balance sheet date 
during periods of a strengthening dollar  the company s us dollar financial results related to operations conducted in foreign currencies are reduced because the local currency amounts are translated into fewer us dollars 
conversely  as the dollar weakens  the company s foreign results reported in us dollars will increase accordingly 
approximately of total revenues in were derived from sales in turkey 
these sales were made in turkish lira and the invoiced sale prices are adjusted to account for fluctuations in the exchange rate between the lira and the dollar 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in such exchange rate from the date of the invoice until settlement 
the company may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated transactions 
however  constar does not generally hedge its exposure to translation gains or losses on non us net assets because it reinvests the cash flows within the operations where they are generated 
at december   there were no foreign currency derivatives outstanding 
the company s borrowings under the revolver loan  term b loan and second lien loan bear interest rates based on either a floating rate base rate or the libor rate 
therefore  the company has an exposure to interest rate risk 
however  both the revolver loan and term b loan contain an interest rate floor which is defined as the greater of either or the libor rate 
as of march   the floor of was higher than the libor rate of approximately 
the definitive extent of the company s interest rate risk in connection with these loan facilities is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and borrowing requirements 
the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products are resins that are petrochemical derivatives 
the markets for these resins are cyclical  and are characterized by fluctuations in supply  demand and pricing 
substantially all of constar s customer contracts contain provisions permitting it to pass through the changes in the price of resin  our principal raw material and a major component of cost of goods sold 
when the company adjusts its prices under these agreements to pass through changes in resin prices  its net sales change accordingly but its gross profit is unaffected 
in the aggregate  the lag between effective date of resin price changes and the effective date of price adjustments to its customers under various pass through mechanisms is approximately equal to the company s inventory exposure
