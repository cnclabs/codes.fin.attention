item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and strategic overview regency is a qualified real estate investment trust reit  which began operations in our primary operating and investment goal is long term growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return by focusing on a strategy of owning and operating grocery anchored shopping centers that are anchored by market leading supermarkets  and that are located in areas with attractive demographics 
currently  our real estate investments before depreciation total billion with shopping centers in states 
at december   our gross leasable area gla totaled million square feet and was leased 
geographically  of our gla is located in florida  in california  in texas  in georgia  in ohio  and spread throughout other states 
we own and operate our shopping centers through our operating partnership  regency centers  lp rclp  in which we currently own of the operating partnership units 
regency s operating  investing and financing activities are generally performed by rclp 
we earn revenues and generate operating cash flow by leasing space to grocers and retail side shop tenants in our shopping centers 
we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers  and by developing new shopping centers 
a neighborhood center is a convenient  cost effective distribution platform for food retailers 
grocery anchored centers generate substantial daily traffic and offer sustainable competitive advantages to their tenants 
this high traffic generates increased sales  thereby driving higher occupancy  rental rates and rental rate growth for regency  which we expect to sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term 
we seek a range of strong national  regional and local specialty tenants  for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers 
we have created a formal partnering process the premier customer initiative pci to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our non grocer specialty retailers 
the objective of pci is for regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the best in class operators in their respective merchandising categories 
such tenants reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center s grocery anchor  help to stabilize a center s occupancy  reduce re leasing downtime  reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 
we primarily grow our shopping center portfolio through new shopping center development  where we acquire the land and construct the building 
development is customer driven  meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction 
developments serve the growth needs of our grocery and specialty retail customers  result in modern shopping centers with long term leases from the grocery anchors and produce attractive returns on our invested capital 
this development process can require up to months from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction  lease up and stabilization of rental income  depending upon the size of the project 
generally  anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to construction completion of the entire center  resulting in rental income during the development phase 
we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth programs without compromising our investment grade ratings 
our approach is founded on our self funding business model 
this model utilizes center recycling as a key component 
our recycling strategy calls for us to re deploy the proceeds from the sales of properties into new higher quality developments that we expect to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns on invested capital 
our commitment to maintaining a high quality shopping center portfolio dictates that we continually assess the value of all of our properties and sell those that no longer meet our long term investment standards 
joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new development  as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services 
as asset manager  we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating  investment  and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the joint ventures 
joint ventures grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases of shopping centers from regency 
although selling properties to joint ventures reduces our ownership interest  we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our long term investment strategy 
regency is not subject to liability and has no obligations or guarantees of the joint ventures beyond its ownership percentage 
we have identified certain significant risks and challenges affecting our industry  and we are addressing them accordingly 
a further economic downturn could result in declines in occupancy levels at our shopping centers  which would reduce our rental revenues  however  we believe that our investment focus on grocery anchored shopping centers that provide daily necessities will minimize the impact of a downturn in the economy 
increased competition from super centers such as wal mart could result in grocery anchor closings or consolidations in the grocery store industry 
we currently have shopping centers  less than of our portfolio  that operate within three miles of a super center and we closely monitor their performance and tenants sales 
a slow down in our shopping center development program would reduce operating revenues and gains from sales 
we believe that developing shopping centers in markets with strong demographics with leading grocery stores will enable us to continue to maintain our development program at historical averages

b gla includes of the gla in unconsolidated joint ventures 
annualized base rent includes only regency s pro rata share of rent from unconsolidated joint ventures 
liquidity and capital resources general we expect that cash generated from revenues will provide the necessary funds on a short term basis to pay our operating expenses  interest expense  scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  recurring capital expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers properly  and distributions to stock and unit holders 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during   and  we incurred capital expenditures of million  million and million to maintain our shopping centers  paid scheduled principal payments of million  million and million to our lenders  and paid dividends and distributions of million  million and million to our share and unit holders  respectively 
although base rent is supported by long term lease contracts  tenants who file bankruptcy are able to cancel their leases and close the related stores 
in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases  we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues 
we are not currently aware of any current or pending bankruptcy of any of our tenants that would cause a significant reduction in our revenues  and no tenant represents more than of our annual base rental revenues 
we expect to meet long term capital requirements for maturing preferred units and debt  the acquisition of real estate  and the renovation or development of shopping centers from i residual cash generated from operating activities after the payments described above  ii proceeds from the sale of real estate  iii joint venturing of real estate  iv refinancing of debt  and v equity raised in the private or public markets 
additionally  the company has the right to call and repay  at par  outstanding preferred units five years after their issuance date  at the company s discretion 
we intend to continue to grow our portfolio through new development and acquisitions  either directly or through our joint venture relationships 
because development and acquisition activities are discretionary in nature  they are not expected to burden the capital resources we have currently available for liquidity requirements 
capital necessary to complete developments in process are funded from our line of credit 
regency expects that cash provided by operating activities  unused amounts available under our line of credit and cash reserves are adequate to meet short term and committed long term liquidity requirements 
shopping center development  acquisitions and sales at december   we had projects under construction or undergoing major renovations  which  when completed  we expect to represent an investment of million before the estimated reimbursement of certain tenant related costs and projected sales proceeds from adjacent land and out parcels of million 
costs necessary to complete these developments will be million  are generally already committed as part of existing construction contracts  and will be expended through these developments are approximately complete and pre leased 
the costs necessary to complete these developments will be funded from our line of credit which has a commitment amount of million and a balance of million at december  during  we started million of new development based on total costs that we expect to expend on these centers through completion 
during  we started million of new development representing centers 
during  we acquired four operating properties from third parties for million  representing of our consolidated assets at december  these properties were acquired in existing investment markets  are grocery anchored  and are owned entirely by regency 
comparatively  we acquired five operating properties during for million  or of consolidated assets at december  these acquisitions did not have a significant impact on operations during and during  we sold retail centers to third parties for million  compared with retail centers sold for million during as part of our asset recycling program 
of the centers sold in  were operating during and are included in discontinued operations in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
all centers sold during were operating and are included in discontinued operations 
we also sold partial interests in properties both in and to joint ventures for million and million  respectively  discussed further below under investments in real estate partnerships 
we have an inventory of land out parcels adjacent to our shopping centers that we routinely develop  lease  or sell 
during  sales related to out parcels were million compared to million in total gains from sales of real estate included in continuing operations and discontinued operations were million in  compared with million in investments in new developments and acquisitions  and proceeds from the sale of properties to third parties or partial sales to joint ventures are included in investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  this compares with net cash provided by investing activities of million in and net cash used in investing activities of million in investments in real estate partnerships at december   we had investments in real estate partnerships of million  primarily comprised of two partnerships  a investment interest in columbia regency retail partners  llc columbia  a joint venture with the oregon state treasury  and a investment interest in macquarie countrywide regency  llc mcwr  a joint venture with an affiliate of macquarie countrywide trust of australia  a sydney  australia based property trust 
the purpose of these partnerships is to invest in retail shopping centers  and we have been engaged by our partners to provide asset and property management services

during  mcwr acquired shopping centers from regency for million  for which we received cash of million  and notes receivable of million with a rate of libor plus  net of our equity contribution of million 
during  mcwr repaid million of the notes and in february  mcwr repaid an additional million 
mcwr is currently in the process of placing third party  fixed rate mortgages on certain properties  the proceeds of which will be used to repay the remaining balance of million 
we recognized gains on these sales of million recorded as gain from sale of operating or development properties 
during  mcwr acquired shopping centers from the company for million  for which we received net proceeds of million and a note receivable of million  net of our equity contribution of million 
mcwr repaid the note receivable during the company recognized gains on these sales of million 
during  mcwr sold two shopping centers to third parties for million 
recognition of gain from sales to joint ventures is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest 
the gains and operations are not recorded as discontinued operations because of our continuing involvement in these shopping centers 
columbia and mcwr intend to continue to acquire retail shopping centers  some of which they may acquire directly from us 
for those properties acquired from third parties  we are required to contribute our pro rata share of the purchase price to the partnership 
debt and equity outstanding debt at december  and consists of the following in thousands notes payable fixed rate mortgage loans   variable rate mortgage loans   fixed rate unsecured loans   total notes payable   unsecured line of credit   total   mortgage loans are secured and may be prepaid  but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums 
mortgage loans are generally due in monthly installments of interest and principal  and mature over various terms through variable interest rates on mortgage loans are currently based on libor  plus a spread in a range of to basis points 
fixed interest rates on mortgage loans range from to 
we have an unsecured line of credit the line with a commitment from our banks of million and a current balance of million 
interest rates paid on the line  which are based on libor plus  were and  on december  and  respectively 
the spread that we pay on the line is dependent upon maintaining specific investment grade ratings 
we are also required to comply  and are in compliance  with certain financial and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing 
the line is used primarily to finance the development of real estate  but is also available for general working capital purposes 
the line matures on april   but contains a one year extension option 
we have executed a commitment with the lead bank under the line and expect to renew it for a term of three years from the original maturity date 
as of december   scheduled principal repayments on notes payable and the line were as follows in thousands scheduled principal term loan total scheduled payments by year payments maturities payments includes the line balance    beyond five years    unamortized debt premiums   total    our investments in real estate partnerships had unconsolidated notes and mortgage loans payable of million at december   and the company s proportionate share of these loans was million 
we do not guarantee any debt of these partnerships beyond our ownership percentage 
we are exposed to capital market risk such as changes in interest rates 
in order to manage the volatility related to interest rate risk  we originate new debt with fixed interest rates  or we consider entering into interest rate hedging arrangements 
at december   of our total debt had fixed interest rates  compared with in we intend to limit the percentage of variable interest rate debt to be no more than of total debt  which we believe to be an acceptable risk 
based upon the variable interest rate debt outstanding at december   if variable interest rates were to increase by  our annual interest expense would increase by million 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we account for derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended statement 
we have million of unsecured debt maturing april  we currently expect to refinance at least million with comparable securities at the maturity date with terms up to years  but at a lower fixed interest rate  and repay any remaining amounts from the line 
in july and september  we entered into two forward starting interest rate swaps of million and million  respectively 
we designated the aggregate million swaps as a hedge to fix the rate on our financing  which we expect to complete on april  the fair value of the swaps was an asset of  as of december   and is recorded in other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the swaps qualify for hedge accounting under statement  therefore  we record changes in fair value through other comprehensive income 
no hedge ineffectiveness has been incurred or recognized to date on these swaps 
amounts that we have reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these swaps will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related debt 
on august   we issued  shares of common stock at per share in a public offering 
the proceeds of million net of offering costs were used to redeem million  or  of the series a preferred units and to reduce the outstanding balance of the line 
at the time of the redemption  million of previously deferred costs related to the original preferred units issuance were expensed in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of minority interest preferred units 
on june   we purchased  shares of common stock for million from security capital pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement dated june  the purchase was funded from the line 
on april   we received proceeds from a million offering of  depositary shares representing series cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
the depositary shares are not convertible into common stock of the company and are redeemable at par upon regency s election on or after april   pay a annual dividend and have a liquidation value of per depositary share 
in march  we redeemed million of series c preferred units and million of series e preferred units in a negotiated transaction 
the redemptions were portions of each series  and we paid a premium on the face value of the redeemed units totaling  at the time of redemption  the premium and million of previously deferred costs related to the original preferred units issuance were expensed in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of minority interest of preferred units 
the redemption was funded from proceeds from the line 
we have issued preferred units in various amounts since  the net proceeds of which we used to reduce the balance of the line 
we sold the issues primarily to institutional investors in private placements 
the preferred units  which may be called by us after certain dates ranging from to  have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption  and they pay a cumulative  quarterly dividend at fixed rates ranging from to 
at any time after years from the date of issuance  the preferred units may be exchanged by the holders for cumulative redeemable preferred stock at an exchange rate of one share for one unit 
the preferred units and the related preferred stock are not convertible into regency common stock 
at december  and the face value of total preferred units issued was million and million  respectively  with an average fixed distribution rate of and  respectively 
included in preferred units are original issuance costs of million that will be expensed as the underlying preferred units are redeemed in the future 
in summary  net cash used in financing activities related to the debt and equity activity discussed above was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial results  and discussions and analysis of these results 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period 
these accounting estimates are based upon our judgments and are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness 
however  the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 
capitalization of costs we have an investment services group with an established infrastructure that supports the due diligence  land acquisition  construction  leasing and accounting of our development properties 
all direct costs related to these activities are capitalized 
included in these costs are interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction  as well as estimates for the portion of internal costs that are incremental and deemed directly or indirectly related to our development activity 
if future accounting standards limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized  or if our development activity were to decline significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs  we could incur a significant increase in our operating expenses 
valuation of real estate investments our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
the review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used to determine whether impairment exists 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods such as i estimating future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate  tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores 
if we determine that impairment exists due to our inability to recover an asset s carrying value  a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value 
discontinued operations the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held for sale on the balance sheet  or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued  requires management to make certain significant judgments 
in evaluating whether a property meets the criteria set forth by financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets statement  the company makes a determination as to the point in time that it can be reasonably certain that a sale will be consummated 
given the nature of all real estate sales contracts  it is not unusual for such contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract 
in addition  certain other matters critical to the final sale  such as financing arrangements  often remain pending even upon contract acceptance 
as a result  properties under contract may not close within the expected time period  if at all 
due to these uncertainties  it is not likely that the company can meet the criteria of statement prior to the sale formally closing 
therefore  any properties categorized as held for sale represent only those properties that management has determined are probable to close within the requirements set forth in statement the company also makes judgments regarding the extent of involvement it will have with a property subsequent to its sale  in order to determine if the results of operations and gain loss on sale should be reflected as discontinued 
consistent with statement  any property sold to an entity in which the company has significant continuing involvement most often joint ventures are not considered to be discontinued 
in addition  any property which the company sells to an unrelated third party  but retains a property or asset management function  is also not considered discontinued 
thus  only properties sold  or to be sold  to unrelated third parties for which the company  in its judgment  has no continuing involvement are classified as discontinued 
income tax status the prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that we will continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit  defined under the internal revenue code 
we are required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that we continue to qualify as a reit 
as a reit  we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders 
we evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our reit status 
determining our taxable income  calculating distributions  and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the internal revenue code 
because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax laws and regulations  our positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fin  which was issued in january fin r is applicable immediately to a variable interest entity created after january  and as of the first interim period ending after march  to those variable interest entities created before february  and not already consolidated under fin in previously issued financial statements 
we did not create any variable interest entities after january  we have analyzed the applicability of this interpretation to our structures created before february  and we do not believe its adoption will have a material effect on our results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity statement 
statement affects the accounting for certain financial instruments  including requiring companies having consolidated entities with specified termination dates to treat minority owners interests in such entities as liabilities in an amount based on the fair value of the entities 
although statement was originally effective july   the fasb has indefinitely deferred certain provisions related to classification and measurement requirements for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments that become subject to statement solely as a result of consolidation including minority interests of entities with specified termination dates 
as a result  statement has no impact on the company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  at december   we held a majority interest in five consolidated entities with specified termination dates ranging from to the minority owners interests in these entities are to be settled upon termination by distribution of either cash or specific assets of the underlying entities 
the estimated fair value of minority interests in these entities was million as compared to the carrying value of million 
we have no other financial instruments that currently are affected by statement results from operations comparison of to at december   we were operating or developing shopping centers 
we identify our shopping centers as either development properties or stabilized properties 
development properties are defined as properties that are in the construction and initial lease up process and are not yet fully leased fully leased generally means greater than leased or occupied 
stabilized properties are those properties that are generally greater than leased and  if they were developed  are more than three years beyond their original development start date 
at december   we had stabilized shopping centers that were leased 
our revenues increased by million  or  to million in this increase was related to changes in occupancy from to for the combined portfolio of stabilized and development properties  growth in re leasing rental rates  and revenues from new developments commencing operations in  net of a reduction in revenues from properties sold 
in  our rental rates grew by from renewal leases and new leases replacing previously occupied spaces in the stabilized properties 
in addition to collecting minimum rent from our tenants for the gla that they lease from us  we also collect contingent rent based upon tenant sales  which we refer to as percentage rent 
tenants are also responsible for reimbursing us for their pro rata share of the expenses associated with operating our shopping centers 
in  our minimum rent increased by million  or  and our recoveries from tenants increased million  or 
percentage rent was million in compared with million in  the reduction primarily related to renewing anchor tenant leases with minimum rent increases which had a corresponding reduction to percentage rent 
our operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in our combined operating  maintenance  and real estate taxes increased by million  or  during to million 
this increase was primarily due to new developments that incurred operating expenses for only a portion of the previous year and general increases in operating expenses on the stabilized properties 
our general and administrative expenses were million during  compared with million in  or higher  a result of general salary and benefit increases 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased million during the current year related to new development properties placed in service during our net interest expense decreased to million in from million in average interest rates on our outstanding debt declined to at december  compared with at december   primarily due to reductions in the libor rate 
our average fixed interest rates were at december   compared with at december  our weighted average outstanding debt during was billion compared with billion in we account for profit recognition on sales of real estate in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
profits from sales of real estate will not be recognized by us unless a sale has been consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  and we do not have substantial continuing involvement with the property 
gains from the sale of operating and development properties were million in related to the sale of properties for million 
during  we recorded gains of million related to the sale of properties for million 
these gains are included in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations because they were either development properties that had no operating income  or they were sold to joint ventures where we have a continuing minority investment 
we review our real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset 
we determine whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon methods described in our critical accounting policies 
in the event a property is impaired  we write down the asset to fair value for held and used assets and to fair value less costs to sell for held for sale assets 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded provisions for losses of approximately million and million  respectively  of which  and million  respectively  were reclassed to operating income from discontinued operations after the related properties were sold 
our income from discontinued operations was million in related to centers sold to third parties for million  which produced gains on sale of million 
in compliance with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement in january  if we sell an asset in the current year  we are required to reclassify its operating income into discontinued operations for all prior periods 
this practice results in a reclassification of amounts previously reported as continuing operations into discontinued operations 
reclassified operating income from discontinued operations was million in  compared with million previously reported for  a result of reclassifying the historical operations of the properties sold in during  we sold properties for million to third parties  which resulted in a gain of million 
our operating income and gains on sales from discontinued operations are shown net of minority interest of exchangeable partnership units totaling  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income for common stockholders was million in  compared with million in  or an increase for the reasons previously discussed 
diluted earnings per share were in  compared with in  or higher  related to the increase in net income offset by an increase in weighted average common shares of  shares 
comparison of to at december   we were operating or developing shopping centers  and we had stabilized shopping centers that were leased 
our revenues increased million  or  to million in this increase was due primarily to growth in re leasing rental rates and revenue from new developments commencing operations in  net of a reduction in revenues from properties sold 
in  our rental rates grew by 
our minimum rent increased by million  or  and our recoveries from tenants increased by million  or 
our percentage rent was million in compared with million in the reduction primarily related to renewing anchor tenant leases with minimum rent increases which had a corresponding reduction to percentage rent  and in certain cases reduced tenant sales 
our operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in our combined operating  maintenance  and real estate taxes increased by million  or  during to million 
the increase was primarily due to new developments that incurred expenses for only a portion of the previous year and general increases in operating expenses on our stabilized properties 
our general and administrative expenses were million during  compared with million in  or higher  as a result of opening several branch offices in new markets and general salary and benefit increases 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased by million during related to new development properties placed in service during and initial depreciation of operating properties previously classified as held for sale that no longer meet the criteria under statement gains from the sale of our operating and development properties were million in related to the sale of properties for million 
during  we recorded gains of million related to the sale of properties for million 
these gains are included in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations because they were either development properties that had no operating income  or they were sold to joint ventures where we have a continuing minority investment 
our net interest expense increased to million in from million in  or 
this increase was primarily due to higher average outstanding debt balances and lower interest capitalization on new developments 
average interest rates on our outstanding debt declined to at december   from at december  our income from discontinued operations was million in compared with million in income from discontinued operations includes gains from the sale of properties of million in as previously discussed 
statement was implemented during  and therefore  no gains or losses from the sales of assets in were reported under discontinued operations in operating income and gains on sales included in discontinued operations are shown net of minority interest of exchangeable partnership units totaling  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income for common stockholders was million in  compared with million in  or a increase for the reasons previously discussed 
diluted earnings per share were in  compared with in  or higher  as a result of the increase in net income offset by an increase in weighted average common shares of  shares 
environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and we are primarily concerned with dry cleaning plants that currently operate or have operated at our shopping centers in the past 
we believe that the tenants who currently operate plants do so in accordance with current laws and regulations 
generally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to environmentally approved systems 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against third party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination 
we have also placed environmental insurance  where possible  on specific properties with known contamination  in order to mitigate our environmental risk 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on regency s financial position  liquidity  or operations  however  we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  that any previous owner  occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants  by the condition of nearby properties  or by unrelated third parties  or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers  however  substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than years  which permits us to seek increased rents upon re rental at market rates 
most of our leases require tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  and insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily related to the variable interest rate on the line of credit and the refinancing of long term debt which currently contain fixed interest rates 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we have no plans to enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands  weighted average interest rates of remaining debt  and the fair value of total debt in thousands  by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt         average interest rate for all debt variable rate libor debt     average interest rate for all debt as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions  which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented above has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and actual interest rates
