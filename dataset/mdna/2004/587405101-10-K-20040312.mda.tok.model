item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations i 
executive overview mercantile bankshares corporation bankshares recorded its th consecutive year of increased net income in net income for bankshares was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year however  diluted net income per common share for decreased by to compared to for due largely to the higher adjusted weighted average shares outstanding for the most noteworthy factors affecting earnings were the acquisition of f m bancorp f m  the continuing repositioning of the investment wealth management iwm division of the lead bank  mercantile safe deposit and trust company msd t  and the downward pressure put on earnings by a lower net interest margin compared to the year earlier 
on august   bankshares completed its acquisition of f m bancorp  a bank holding company headquartered in frederick  maryland 
on the date of purchase  f m had total loans of billion  total investment securities of million  total earning assets of billion  and total deposits of billion 
there were million shares issued in connection with the acquisition  which was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in total consideration paid of million including the cash component 
f m is the second largest affiliate bank in the organization behind only msd t in total assets 
the results of operations and balances for f m are included in the consolidated financial statements from the merger date forward 
bankshares recorded million of goodwill  million of core deposit intangible  million of client relationship intangibles and million in other identified intangible assets 
the weighted average amortization period for newly acquired core deposit intangible is nine years  and the client relationship and other identified intangibles range from three to fifteen years 
investment and wealth management revenues benefited from rising equity market values and the inclusion of revenues from boyd watterson asset management llc  an investment management firm and peremel company  inc  a directed and discount brokerage company  acquired on march  and april   respectively 
in the aggregate  these companies were purchased for approximately million in cash 
the boyd watterson acquisition has a potential additional contingent payment of up to million based upon performance  among other factors 
the contingent payment will be recorded  assuming specific metrics are met  and become payable three years from the acquisition date 
bankshares recorded approximately million of identified intangibles  mostly client relationships  as a result of these acquisitions 
these intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over a range of three to eight years 
goodwill recorded on these transactions totaled approximately million at december  a generally sluggish economy  decreases in long term interest rates  and bankshares net asset sensitive position combined to drive the net interest margin basis points lower for the year than for the year the net interest margin was for compared to for approximately two thirds  or basis points  of the decline is attributable to the lower benefit derived from noninterest bearing sources of funding  such as demand deposit accounts and shareholders equity 
on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income was reduced by nearly million as a result of the margin compression 
management does not anticipate any significant change in the level of interest rates in and is looking for improved loan growth to help offset the continuing pressure on the net interest margin in the current low interest rate environment 
although certain statistical performance measures declined slightly from the prior year  proved to be another year of relatively solid performance  as indicated by the standard industry measures of return on average assets roa and return on average shareholders equity roe 
the roa was  compared to for the year ended december  bankshares roe decreased to  compared to the reported for average assets increased by to billion  average deposits increased by to billion and average loans increased by to billion for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
approximately one half of the respective increases in the year average balances are attributable to f m 
bankshares also reports net operating earnings  defined as gaap generally accepted accounting principles earnings excluding the amortization of intangible assets associated with purchase accounting for business combinations  securities gains and losses  and other significant gains  losses or expenses such as those associated with integrating acquired entities operations into bankshares 
net operating earnings totaled million for the year  an increase of over the million for diluted net operating earnings per share for were compared with for last year 
a reconciliation of gaap basis net income to net operating earnings can be found in footnote no 
of the financial statements 
average shareholders equity to average assets remained strong at  increasing slightly from for in   shares were repurchased under bankshares buyback plan in open market purchases 
bankshares was not an active acquirer during mainly due to the restrictions in place associated with our acquisition of f m 
the buyback plan retired  shares through open market purchases made during management believes that reporting several key measures based on tangible assets total assets less intangible assets and tangible equity total equity less intangible assets is important  as this is the basis for measuring the adequacy of capital for regulatory purposes 
for the year  return on average tangible assets was  compared to for the year the ratio of average tangible equity to average tangible assets for was compared to for the decline in average tangible equity to average tangible assets was largely attributable to the use of million of cash or of the consideration paid instead of issuing only shares to acquire f m 
for the reconciliation of gaap to non gaap measures  see footnote no 
of the financial statements 
the remaining sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations will provide a more detailed explanation of the important trends and material changes in components of our financial statements 
the discussion suggests that sustaining future earnings growth comparable to our experience in past years will require  among other things  efficient generation of loan growth in a competitive market  while maintaining an adequate spread between yields on earning assets and the cost of funds 
our degree of success in meeting these goals depends on unpredictable factors such as possible changes in prevailing interest rates  the mix of deposits  credit quality and general economic conditions 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial information presented in this report 
critical accounting policies and related estimates set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that management believes are the most critical to understanding bankshares consolidated financial statements  financial condition and results of operations  and which involve complex management judgments  uncertainties and or estimates 
information regarding bankshares other accounting policies is included in footnote no 
of the financial statements 
allowance for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
bankshares allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based on evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as well as information about the prevailing economic and business environment among other things 
for a full discussion of bankshares methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  see allowance for loan losses below and footnote no 
of the financial statements 
loans on nonaccrual status or deemed to be impaired a loan asset will be classified and placed into nonaccrual status when the principal or interest payments on any loan eg  commercial  mortgage and construction loans is past due days or more at the end of a calendar quarter and or the payment in full of principal or interest is not expected 
consumer installment loans are charged off when they become days past due 
additionally  a loan may be put on nonaccrual status sooner than days  if in management s judgment  the loan or portions thereof are deemed uncollectible 
bankshares ceases to accrue interest income on such loans 
subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal  and interest income is recorded only once principal recovery is reasonably assured 
generally a loan may be restored to accruing status when all past due principal  interest and late charges have been paid and the bank expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest 
a loan is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if it is probable that bankshares will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans do not include large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are evaluated collectively for impairment eg  residential mortgages and consumer installment loans 
the impairment of a loan is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the repayment is expected to be provided predominantly by the underlying collateral 
a majority of bankshares impaired loans are measured by reference to the fair value of the collateral 
income taxes bankshares recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carryovers  and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment  based on available evidence  that future realization is more likely than not 
if management determines that bankshares may be unable to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  then bankshares would be required to record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax asset 
in such an event  a direct charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the recorded value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable amount 
although management has determined that a valuation allowance is not currently required  no assurance can be given that one will not be required in the future 
for more information regarding bankshares accounting for income taxes  see footnote no 
of the financial statements 
valuation of goodwill intangible assets and analysis for impairment bankshares has increased its market share  in part  through the acquisition of entire financial institutions accounted for under the business combinations method of accounting  as well as from the purchase of other financial institutions branches not the entire institution 
for acquisitions under the purchase method  bankshares is required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which is an estimate determined by the use of internal or other valuation techniques 
see footnote no

ii 
analysis of operating results for to segment reporting bankshares has identified three distinct business segments for which financial information is segregated for use in assessing performance and allocating resources when reporting to the board of directors 
this segmentation is consistent with the reporting structure put in place at the time bankshares was formed 
at that time the organization consisted of a lead bank  msd t  with two business segments banking and iwm  and a community bank segment  which has been built through acquisitions and continued operation of independent charters 
this latter segment consists of the group of community banks collectively  the community banks 
mortgage banking activities are not viewed as a separate business line and  accordingly  are included in the msd t banking division 
a schedule disclosing the details of these operating segments can be found in footnote no 
of the financial statements 
segment financial information is subjective and  unlike financial accounting  is not necessarily based on gaap 
as a result  the financial information of the reporting segments is not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by others and may not be comparable with bankshares consolidated results 
certain expense amounts  such as operations overhead  have been reclassified from internal financial reporting in order to provide for proper allocation of costs in the reported data 
community banks the addition of f m during had a significant impact on nearly every line of the consolidated balance sheet and statement of consolidated income as well as the performance of the community bank segment as set forth below 
net income for the community banks for increased to million  compared to million for net interest income for the community banks increased to million for from million for the growth in net interest income in was attributable to a increase in average earning assets  which offset a basis point decline in the net interest margin from to

additionally  expenses for included million of severance and million paid to terminate a technology equipment lease  both of which were related to the ongoing repositioning of iwm s capabilities and its infrastructure 
in  severance expense for iwm totaled million 
substantial progress was made in repositioning the investment and wealth management business 
new capabilities were added  including three registered hedge fund of funds  an expanded brokerage capability through peremel company  inc  an open architecture investment management platform  a k program and the introduction of the mercantile dow jones us portfolio funds

net interest income net interest income represents the largest source of bankshares revenue 
it is affected by both changes in the level of interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk represents one of the more significant risks facing financial institutions like bankshares 
see additional discussion under the caption interest rate risk  below 
it is measured in terms of the effect changes in market interest rates have on net interest income 
bankshares is asset sensitive  with assets repricing more quickly than liabilities in response to changes in interest rates 
in a falling rate environment  bankshares net interest margin net interest income expressed as a percent of average earning assets compresses  causing net interest income to slow 
net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  was million for this represents an increase of  or million  over the prior year s million 
in  fully tax equivalent net interest income increased by million  or  over as previously noted  net interest income is affected by changes in the volume of earning assets and the net interest margin earned thereon 
the rate volume analysis table below presents further details supporting this discussion 
average earning assets increased by billion  or  in  with approximately of this increase attributable to the f m acquisition 
average total loans grew billion  or  during as with earning assets  approximately of this growth relates to the f m acquisition 
despite the sluggish economy  organic loan growth was fairly consistent throughout the year 
while average total loans grew by million  or  during  substantially all of the growth occurred during the first half of the year 
average securities  the other major component of earning assets  increased by million  or  in compared to an increase of million  or  in the prior year 
the f m acquisition accounted for slightly less than of the increase in the slowing in the growth of the investment portfolio is attributable to the improved loan growth rate and a slowing in the deposit growth rate  especially in the fourth quarter of see iii 
analysis of financial condition below for a more in depth discussion of balance sheet trends 
the overall growth in average earning assets added million to net interest income in offsetting the increase in net interest income from the growth in average earning assets was a basis point decline in the net interest margin from in to in the decline in the net interest margin reduced net interest income by million 
the net interest margin declined for the third straight year 
the net interest spread also declined by basis points to in from in the net interest spread is the difference between the yield earned on total earning assets and the rate paid on total interest bearing liabilities 
in response to the slowing economy  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board began taking action in to reduce short term interest rates 
they reduced short term rates by basis points in  followed by basis points in and basis points in the net interest margin declined by basis points in  primarily as a result of the unprecedented drop in the level of short term interest rates 
since  the margin has continued to decline  not because of the additional short term rate reductions  but due to a decline in intermediate and long term interest rates 
the impact of the decline in these rates is reflected in the benefit bankshares derives from its noninterest bearing sources of funding earning assets 
such benefit declined by basis points in and basis points in  a combined decline of basis points over the two year period 
approximately of the funding of average earning assets is derived from noninterest bearing sources 
the basis point decline in the spread during is attributable to the difficulty of further reducing the rate paid on managed rate deposits savings  checking plus interest and money market accounts and remaining competitive in the marketplace 
the average yield on earning assets declined basis points to in in comparison  the average rate paid on interest bearing funds declined only basis points to in  from in msd t s net interest margin decreased basis points  from in to in the community banks net interest margin decreased basis points  from in to in over the two year period ended december   msd t s net interest margin declined basis points compared to a decline of basis points for the community banks 
the community banks account for most of bankshares residential real estate and consumer loan portfolios 
these portfolios were most affected by the refinancing triggered by the drop in intermediate and long term rates 
as a result  the net interest margin contracted to a greater extent at the community banks than at msd t 
understanding the trend of the net interest margin during is important when assessing the outlook for the net interest margin in the year ahead 
the net interest margin was for the first quarter of  up basis points from the fourth quarter of during the second quarter of  the margin dropped basis points  followed by an additional basis point decline in the third quarter 
during this six month period  intermediate and long term interest rates declined  triggering a surge in consumer and mortgage loan refinancing 
during the fourth quarter of  intermediate and long term rates increased from their low levels  slowing the pace of refinancing and improving yields on new consumer and mortgage loans 
bankshares net interest margin improved basis points to for the fourth quarter of looking forward to  management does not anticipate an increase in short term interest rates or overall interest rates from where they were at the close of normally  this stable scenario would result in a downward movement in the net interest margin as fixed rate loans and investments mature and are replaced by loans and investments at lower current yields 
however  with some signs of an improving economy beginning to emerge  management anticipates the net interest margin will remain stable  as improving loan growth should result in earning assets more heavily weighted toward higher yielding loans compared to investment securities

rate volume analysis a rate volume analysis  which demonstrates changes in tax equivalent interest income and expense for significant assets and liabilities  appears below

changes attributable to mix rate and volume are included in volume variance 
interest income fully tax equivalent interest income amounted to million in  an increase of million  or  from million in this compares favorably to the million  or decrease in from the slight increase in was due to a decline in market interest rates  resulting in an million reduction in interest income  offset by million in additional interest income generated by the growth in earning assets primarily due to the addition of f m 
during  the million reduction in interest income resulted from the lower yield on earning assets and was only partially offset by the million increase derived from the growth in earning assets 
at year end  the prime rate was  compared to and at year end and  respectively 
the average prime rate was for  compared to for  a decline of basis points 
the yield on average total loans in was  a basis point decline from in the commercial and construction loan portfolios are the most sensitive to changes in short term interest rates  while the residential real estate and consumer loan portfolios are mostly affected by long term rates 
the yield on the consumer loan portfolio declined basis points and the residential real estate portfolio declined by basis points 
the commercial and construction loan portfolios declined by and basis points  respectively 
these declines reflected the federal reserve board s basis point reduction in short term rates during the fourth quarter of and basis point reduction at the end of the second quarter of the yield on investment securities  at in  declined basis points from in the yield on the portfolio decreased basis points in from in more than offsetting the negative impact on interest income from reinvesting at lower yields has been the increasing size and changing mix of the portfolio 
during bankshares followed a strategy begun in to shift from us treasury to higher yielding us agency securities and mortgage backed securities 
this has resulted in a mix of  and  respectively  at december  the other of the investment securities was comprised of municipals and other investments at year end 
interest expense total interest expense in was million  a decrease of million from million in the decrease in interest expense for was attributable to a decrease in the rate paid on total interest bearing funds of basis points  which was partially offset by a growth in average balances 
total interest expense in was million less than the million reported in with the combination of interest rates at record low levels and slowing deposit inflows  management does not anticipate that it will be able to significantly reduce the rate paid on managed rate deposits savings  checking plus interest and money market accounts 
see management s discussion under interest rate risk below for further information regarding bankshares exposure to changes in interest rates 
the rate paid on average total interest bearing deposits was in  a decline of basis points from for the prior year 
the rate paid on savings  checking plus interest and money market accounts declined basis points  basis points and basis points  respectively 
certificates of deposit  and over declined basis points  while the rate paid on other time deposits decreased basis points in the most interest rate sensitive source of funds is short term borrowings 
this category is comprised of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreement to repurchase and commercial paper 
the duration of these funds is very short  with most repricing daily 
reflecting the rate environment  the rate paid on short term borrowings declined basis points to in  after having decreased by basis points in to 
the rate paid on long term debt declined basis points in  following a decline of basis points in the prior year 
the decline is primarily related to the million of year debt issued by msd t in the fourth quarter of these notes  which were issued at a fixed rate of  were converted to a floating rate through an interest rate swap 
the notes reprice quarterly and carried an effective cost of during additionally  bankshares issued million of subordinated debt in april the notes were issued at a fixed rate of 
subsequently  million of this debt was converted to a floating rate through interest rate swaps

investment and wealth management revenue represents the largest source of noninterest income at 
improvement in iwm revenue came principally from the inclusion of boyd watterson asset management llc and peremel company  inc  which were acquired on march  and april   respectively 
together  these acquisitions added million in revenues 
the improved performance in equity markets that began in the second quarter of had a positive impact on iwm revenues  mostly in the second half of the year 
approximately of iwm s managed assets is invested in equities 
between december  and december   major equity indices rose sharply 
the s p index was up  the dow jones industrial average was up and the nasdaq was up 
higher revenues also reflected increased new sales across both mutual funds and separately managed accounts 
for  revenues will benefit from a full year of boyd watterson and peremel 
additional growth will depend on continued new sales and increased distribution  equity and bond market conditions and further acquisitions  if any 
see the discussion under segment reporting above for additional information relating to iwm 
service charges on deposit accounts increased in line with the growth in core consumer and commercial deposit balances 
this growth is a result not only of the f m acquisition  but also of significant growth in bankshares deposits excluding f m 
the million  or  growth in service charge income is almost equally divided between the f m acquisition and core deposit growth 
additionally  a reduction in waivers of nonsufficient funds and overdraft charges increased these fees million  or 
commercial account analysis fees increased thousand  or  primarily due to reduced earning credits on these accounts as a result of lower interest rates during mortgage banking fees increased by million to million in bankshares mortgage banking revenue is comprised of loan origination fees  which is the largest category at of total mortgage banking fees  servicing fees  and net gain on the sales of mortgage loans 
mercantile mortgage corporation s commercial loan origination and servicing fees increased by a combined million due to the activities of its subsidiary  columbia national real estate financing llc 
commercial mortgages are sold in the secondary market with rights to servicing retained 
residential mortgage banking fees increased by million due to activities conducted by f m and by mercantile mortgage corporation through its joint venture with wells fargo ventures llc wfv 
mercantile mortgage corporation owns a stake in mercantile mortgage llc  which has originated retail mortgages since april bankshares reports its share of the net profits from the joint venture as mortgage banking fees 
the financial risk for bankshares is the initial capital contribution to the venture  which is minimal 
as the primary beneficiary and managing partner  wfv is responsible for consolidating the joint venture in its financial statements 
either party may terminate the joint venture with days notice 
residential mortgages are sold in the secondary market with rights to servicing released 
during  f m s residential mortgage business will be integrated into the joint venture 
historically  msd t has utilized the joint venture to underwrite and close residential mortgages on its behalf 
as a result of the f m integration  the joint venture will be offering this service to several of the community banks 
investment securities gains mostly represent sales of equity securities  with the balance related to the continued restructuring of the investment securities bond portfolios held in available for sale portfolios 
these gains were generated as part of a repositioning of the balance sheet for interest rate changes that adjust portfolio yields and duration 
other income includes several categories 
electronic banking fees consist of merchant card processing fees  foreign atm fees and debit card fees 
these fees increased to million  up from charges and fees on loans consist of letters of credit fees  late fees and other assessed loan fees 
sixty percent of the increase in this category is attributable to f m 
letters of credit fees decreased million 
this decrease was more than offset by an increase in late fees of thousand and a increase  or million in other loan fees 
insurance revenues are derived from fee income related to the sale and servicing of insurance products 
the million increase is due primarily to f m  which operates two wholly owned subsidiaries  keller stonebraker insurance  inc and potomac basin group associates  inc these insurance agencies provide a full line of consumer and commercial products 
consumer products include annuities  homeowners  automobile  life and personal umbrella insurance products 
commercial products include property and casualty packages  workers compensation  bonds  professional liability and k and other benefit plans

the table above shows the major components of noninterest expenses 
the principal reason for the year over year increase in each noninterest expense category was the inclusion of f m  boyd watterson asset management llc and peremel company  inc in  million was recorded in pretax merger related expenses related to the f m acquisition 
there were no merger related expenses recognized in for further information regarding the various categories that merger related expenses affected  see footnote no 
of the financial statements 
controlling costs and maintaining operational efficiencies remain primary objectives for bankshares 
a key measure that is closely monitored is bankshares overall efficiency ratio 
it is computed by dividing noninterest expenses by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and noninterest income 
bankshares efficiency ratio was compared to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
about half of the increase in the efficiency ratio for compared to was due to the significant investments in iwm during the other half of the increase was due to the decline in bankshares net interest margin for on a non gaap basis  the operating efficiency ratio excludes amortization expense for intangibles  nonoperating income and expenses  such as securities gains and losses and merger related expenses 
bankshares operating efficiency ratio was  compared to for the years ended december  and  respectively

employee related expenses  which include salaries  benefits and incentive compensation  is the largest component at of noninterest expenses 
f m accounts for a substantial portion of the million increase in employee related expenses for compared to the operational merger of f m took place in the fourth quarter of management expects employee related expenses associated with f m to diminish as head count and other targeted cost saves are realized 
additionally  there were approximately million in pre operational merger related staff costs and approximately million in severance expense  of which million relates to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards for employees in iwm whose employment was terminated 
higher commissions  incentive compensation and normal merit increases also contributed to the increase in employee related expenses 
an increase of million  or over the prior year  in commissions and incentive compensation is tied directly to bankshares revenue and overall performance 
stock based compensation expense  which is included in salary expense  increased due to stock options and restricted stock awards granted under bankshares omnibus stock plan

pretax merger related expenses contributed million  or approximately one third  of this increase 
merger related professional expenses included services rendered to implement system conversions  consolidation and branch closings  employee benefits and tax consulting 
communications and supplies and marketing merger related expenses relate to the increase in the supplies needed for additional branch office locations  including brochures and operational supplies  as well as increased customer information mailings and disclosures

travel and membership increased to million  or  in from million in amortization of other identifiable intangibles increased to million in from million in licensing and insurance increased to million  or  in from million in increases in these three categories are mostly attributable to the increased activities relating to the acquisition of f m 
other expenses include armored couriers service  credit and debit card charges  check clearing and processing charges and other miscellaneous charges 
these expenses for were million  up from million in management expects expenses to increase modestly due to the incremental increase on a linked quarter basis offsetting some savings from the integration of f m

as part of a new investment portfolio strategy designed to maintain a core amount of liquidity and to increase portfolio yields in a low interest rate environment  bankshares increased its holdings of mortgage backed securities over the course of mortgage backed securities were purchased for the investment portfolio because they have short or intermediate term durations and represent a stable source of cash flows 
as a result of this new program and the f m acquisition  mortgage backed securities rose million to billion during similarly  the proportion of mortgage backed securities to total available for sale securities increased from in to over the same period in in the available for sale portfolio  us treasury obligations decreased million  or  in while us agency obligations increased by million  or 
at year end  the average maturity of the bond component of the available for sale portfolio was years  a year increase from year end the market value of the bond investment portfolio as of december   was of amortized cost  compared to at december  at december   billion of these investments had unrealized gains of million  and the remaining million of these investment securities had unrealized losses of million

msd t s growth  at in remained well below historical levels 
the community banks have a higher concentration in the residential real estate and consumer portfolios than msd t 
the community banks have remained focused on relationships in local markets and management believes this allows the community banks management to tailor loan products and services to their individual communities 
msd t is focused more on commercial and construction loans 
the leasing portfolio at msd t decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million one year ago 
because of the dynamics of the equipment leasing business  and the risk inherent therein  management decided in the fourth quarter of to discontinue marketing this product line 
as noted above  commercial real estate experienced growth in  both in absolute terms and as a portion of total loans 
a large percentage of the commercial real estate mortgages and construction loan balances outstanding at december   were for owner occupied properties 
although it recognizes the risks associated with some types of real estate loans  bankshares believes it is consistent with sound banking practice to continue to extend real estate credits to carefully selected customers 
bankshares historical charge off experience for real estate loans compares favorably with loss experience in other portfolio segments

risk management bankshares has established an integrated risk management structure in which senior management regularly identifies  measures and manages risks 
the chief risk officer coordinates and directs the work of several standing committees charged with managing the risks bankshares faces see below and provides regular reports to the audit committee 
these committees are the asset and liability committee alco which  as described in more detail below  manages interest rate risk  market risk and liquidity risk 
the credit quality committee oversees the establishment of consistent credit quality standard policies  monitors the functioning of the newly established loan review function  and along with the ceo and cfo  determines the allowance for loan and lease loss reserves and related issues 
the compliance committee establishes global compliance guidelines and ensures strict compliance with all relevant regulatory and statutory requirements for bankshares and its affiliates 
the disclosure committee  comprised of senior representatives of all of bankshares business lines  reviews bankshares periodic disclosures and ensures compliance with the requirements of the us securities laws and best practices 
the technology and operations committee evaluates on an ongoing basis operational risk and technology risk to bankshares 
credit risk analysis bankshares loans and commitments are substantially to borrowers located in our immediate region 
bankshares has restricted its participation in multibank credits where bankshares is not the managing or agent bank 
central to the operation of a sound and successful financial institution is the balanced management of asset growth and credit quality 
responsibility for loan underwriting and monitoring is clearly fixed on key management personnel in each of our affiliates and  ultimately  on the board of directors of each affiliate 
these responsibilities are supported at the holding company level by appropriate underwriting guidelines and effective ongoing loan review 
in addition  bankshares has set an internal limit for each affiliate bank  that is well below the regulatory limit  on the maximum amount of credit that may be extended to a single borrower

 loan loss allowance methodology and documentation  and the federal financial institutions examination council s policy statement on allowance for loan and lease losses methodologies and documentation for banks and savings institutions 
an allowance for loan losses is maintained sufficient to absorb losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is a function of specific loan allowances  general loan allowances based on historic loan loss experience and current trends and  lastly  allowances based on existing economic conditions that affect the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
these can include  but are not limited to  exposure to an industry experiencing problems  changes in the nature or volume of the portfolio  delinquency and nonaccrual trends 
the portfolio review and the calculation of the allowance is performed by management at each affiliate bank based on its knowledge of its loans and risk factors prevailing in its market 
other risk factors are reviewed by bankshares credit quality committee to determine their impact on the allowance for loan losses  with final evaluation done at the holding company 
each affiliate s reserve is dedicated to that affiliate only and is not available to absorb losses from another affiliate 
the level and adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly by bankshares credit quality committee 
all loan loss reserves are subject to annual regulatory examinations and determination as to their methodology and adequacy 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is at an adequate level to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
the specific allowance is based on analysis of the loan portfolio by each affiliate bank 
each loan with an outstanding balance in excess of a specified threshold that is either on nonaccrual status or on the watchlist will be evaluated 
the watchlist represents loans identified and closely followed by management 
they possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues 
monitored loans  which are included in the watchlist  display characteristics suggesting they may be classified as nonperforming loans in the near feature 
the identified loans are evaluated for potential loss by analyzing current collateral values or present value of cash flows  as well as the capacity of the guarantor  as applicable 
the specific allowance resulting from this review increased to million from million at december  and  respectively 
the largest portion of this component is from msd t s portfolio  at and  for and  respectively 
the specific reserve increased primarily due to several commercial loans at msd t that moved to nonaccrual status during the general allowance calculation  which is also completed on a quarterly basis  begins with segmentation of the remaining portfolio according to loan types as presented in external reports 
historical loss factors are maintained  providing the starting point of the analysis 
historical loss factors are applied to all non watchlist loans 
management is currently utilizing the past five year loss history specific to each major segment to perform the allocation 
as to watchlist loans  loss factors are applied based on the severity of the loan grade 
historical loss factors are adjusted to reflect the point in time that management initially identified a potential impairment loss in such risk rated loans as opposed to when such loss is actually taken as a charge off against the allowance 
this adjustment is necessary as bankshares practice has generally been to work with its borrowers through their economic difficulties 
accordingly  historical losses may tend to lag the national and regional economic cycles 
those loss factors are applied to all loans within the same risk rating 
qualitative factors that may cause credit losses to deviate from average historical experience are then developed 
these include but are not limited to changes in the volume and severity of past due loans  changes in the volume of watchlist loans and nonaccruals  concentrations in a specific industry or geographic location  administrative risk concerns that include changes in the loan review and loan grading system  changes in lending policies and procedures which include underwriting  collection  charge off and recovery practices  changes in management or the staff of any previously mentioned areas  and current economic conditions and indicators 
management s judgment and experience are key to this process 
these factors are revised to address current conditions in the portfolio 
the general allowance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
increases in the general allowance can be attributed to the ongoing refinement of the methodology in quantifying risk segments and estimation techniques used in the calculation 
the increase in allocation to the commercial loan portfolio is related to the f m acquisition and the trend in nonperformers at msd t 
the increases in the residential real estate and consumer allocations are related to the f m acquisition 
the decline in the allocation to the lease financing portfolio is a result of the charge offs and workout of problems within that portfolio identified in allocation of a portion of the allowance does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans was at december   compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans declined from december  to december   principally as a result of the f m acquisition 
f m s loan portfolio is more heavily weighted towards consumer and residential real estate loans 
potential losses in these portfolios are more predictable and quantifiable  generally resulting in a lower required allowance 
f m s allowance at date of merger was less than of loans outstanding 
reflecting this and overall credit quality trends  the allowance within the community banks  as a percentage of loans outstanding declined from at december  to at december  in contrast  the allowance as a percentage of loans for msd t increased from at december  to at december  this increase is attributable to the additional specific allowance allocation at msd t 
during the provision for loan loss expense was million  compared to million in the provision at msd t was million for  an increase of over the million provided in the community banks recorded a reversal in their aggregate allowance of million in  compared to a provision of million in the shift in the provisioning reflects the overall credit quality trends within the two business segments 
net charge offs decreased to million during  compared to million during the commercial portfolio represented the largest net charge off amount for at million  or of total net charge offs 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were  
and 
for the years ended december   and  respectively 
intensive collection efforts continue after a loan is charged off in order to maximize the recovery of amounts previously charged off 
recoveries as a percent of loans charged off were in  in and in in  recoveries increased over  and charge offs decreased  symptomatic of the economy stabilizing and showing some signs of improvement 
recoveries in a given year may not relate to loans charged off in that year

the amount of interest income on the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans that was recorded totaled million and thousand in and  respectively 
note management was monitoring loans estimated to aggregate million at december  and million at december  that were not classified as nonaccrual or renegotiated loans 
these loans had characteristics which indicated they might result in such classification in the future 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  renegotiated loans and other real estate owned ie  real estate acquired in foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure 
with respect to nonaccrual loans  our policy is that  regardless of the value of the underlying collateral and or guarantees  no interest is accrued on the entire balance once either principal or interest payments on any loan become days past due at the end of a calendar quarter 
all accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is eliminated from the income statement and is recognized only as collected 
if a loan is impaired and has a specific loss allocation based on an analysis under sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  all payments are then applied against the loan s principal 
a loan may be put on nonaccrual status sooner than this standard if  in management s judgment  such action is warranted 
nonperforming assets nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned as a percent of period end loans and other real estate owned was 
at december   compared to 
in the preceding year 
at year end  nonperforming assets were million  compared to million in nonperforming loans totaled million at december   compared to million at december  nonperforming loans increased in three categories of the portfolio commercial and industrial  residential real estate and consumer 
the largest dollar increase in nonperforming loans was million in the commercial and industrial category  which accounted for of nonperforming loans at december  msd t s nonperforming loans were million at december   representing of bankshares total nonperforming loans 
the increase is primarily related to three large loan relationships that migrated from monitored to nonaccrual status during the year 
msd t s nonperforming loans amounted to million at december  nonperforming loans at the community banks were million at december   relatively unchanged from million at december  the level of monitored loans  or loans with characteristics suggesting that they may be classified as nonperforming in the near future  increased during the year 
at december   monitored loans were million  compared to million a year before 
two loans at msd t contributed million to the current total 
these loans are secured by two commercial aircraft  which are leased to a regional commercial airline 
a long time customer of msd t holds a controlling interest in the airline 
in light of the prevailing conditions in the commercial airline industry  management has included these loans in the monitored status 
the balance of the portfolio also was examined for additional exposure to this industry and it was determined to be minimal 
this exposure was factored into the general reserve allocation for commercial loans 
other real estate owned was thousand at december  compared to thousand at december  these properties generally are sold within a short period 
therefore  regardless of the amount  the properties generally will have changed from year to year 
other real estate owned is carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
refer to the data in the nonperforming assets chart above  which shows the changes in the amounts of various categories of nonperforming assets over the last five years and sets forth the relationship between nonperforming loans and total loans

earnings simulation model projections the following table summarizes the effect a positive and basis point change and a negative basis point change in interest rates would have on bankshares net interest income over the next months 
calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income change in interest rates as of december  basis points interest rate risk the objective of interest rate risk management is to contain the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the process involves identification and management of the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates and other market factors 
managing to mitigate interest rate risk  however  is not an exact science 
not only does the interval between repricing of assets and liabilities change from day to day as the assets and liabilities change  but also for some assets and liabilities  contractual maturity and the actual cash flows experienced are not the same 
for example  residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities may have contractual maturities well in excess of five years  but depending on the interest rate carried by the specific mortgages and the then currently prevailing rate of interest  such mortgages and securities may be prepaid much more rapidly 
similarly  savings  checking plus interest and money market deposits may be withdrawn on seven days notice 
while these contracts are extremely short  it has been bankshares experience that these funding pools  when considered as a whole  have a multiyear duration 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis static gap table above reflects the expected contractual cash flows or maturities of assets and liabilities  along with the scheduled opportunity to reset interest rates in a downward rate environment 
as the table reflects at december   bankshares is asset sensitive since more assets than liabilities are subject to repricing within the next months 
the data in this table would suggest that net interest income should tend to increase in a rising interest rate environment and decrease in a declining rate environment 
the absolute change in the repricing of products varies greatly 
as noted in the discussion of net interest income  changes in short term interest rates by the federal reserve board result in an almost similar change in the yield on bankshares prime rate based loans 
in contrast  the repricing characteristics of certain managed rate deposits  primarily savings  checking plus interest and money market accounts  have proven to be much less sensitive during the current declining rate environment than they were in prior rate cycles 
the current experience has been factored into the table 
because of the limitations of the static gap analysis  management primarily utilizes an earnings simulation model to monitor bankshares risk exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the model provides management with the tools to reflect more reasonably how specific loan  investment  deposit and debt products will respond to changes in market interest rates 
this model projects the effects on net income based on factors such as changes in interest rates  the shape of the yield curve and interest rate relationships 
as seen in the earnings simulation model projections table above  within a one year horizon  the model forecasts that  compared to the net interest income projection under stable rates  net interest income would increase by and if interest rates increased by and basis points  respectively  and that net interest income would decrease by if interest rates decreased by basis points 
given the current low level of interest rates  bankshares is limiting its modeling to the basis point decline in future interest rates 
these results are not necessarily indicative of future actual results  nor do they take into account certain actions that management may undertake in response to future changes in interest rates 
the federal reserve board s basis point reduction in short term interest rates over the two year period ended december   continued to compress the net interest margin 
beginning in  management started taking actions to reduce the magnitude of bankshares risk related to further interest rate reductions or the compression in spreads from a sustained low interest rate environment 
these actions included expanding and repositioning the investment portfolio and adding an indexed money market account 
this product is more rate sensitive than the traditional money market product 
management took advantage of the lower rate environment to secure long term funding through the issuance in april of million in subordinated notes at bankshares 
the notes carried a fixed rate of  of which million was swapped to a floating rate as a fair value hedge 
this resulted in an increase in the amount of liabilities that reprice within the three month time frame 
management will continue to pursue any combination of these strategies as long as interest rates remain low and the economy and customer borrowing needs remain subdued 
despite these efforts  the increase in sensitivity from that reported at december  is a function of the current low rate environment 
it reflects the inability to reduce rates on managed deposits to match a drop in interest rates 
it also reflects bankshares strong capital position 
at times  bankshares efforts to mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates have resulted in loan pricing policies that have not coincided with its commercial customers preferences 
as a result  msd t entered into a master agreement with another bank for the purpose of making interest rate swaps and similar interest rate protection arrangements in connection with commercial loans made to msd t s customers 
this arrangement enables msd t s customers to eliminate potential volatility of interest rates and associated risks 
msd t will only enter into specific interest rate protection arrangements under the master agreement with respect to which it has approved a corresponding credit facility with the customer  and as to which the customer is entering into a corresponding interest rate protection arrangement with msd t 
management does not anticipate that these arrangements will expose bankshares to any risk beyond the normal credit risks undertaken with any lending arrangement 
as of december   one customer had entered into such an arrangement 
this swap agreement has not had a material impact on the financial performance of bankshares 
management anticipates that should interest rates reverse course and begin to rise  customer interest in this option will increase 
as a matter of policy  bankshares does not use highly leveraged derivative instruments for interest rate risk management 
market risk market risk is defined as the constraint imposed by lower market values of assets and liabilities as interest rates and equity markets fluctuate 
changes in market values also impact the fee income earned by iwm  where a significant portion of the fee schedule is tied to current asset values under management or administration 
bankshares has designated substantially all of its investment portfolio as available for sale and in accordance with financial reporting standards  this portfolio is reported at fair value 
changes in fair value  net of tax  are reflected as a component of shareholders equity 
bankshares maintenance of capital ratios well above regulatory requirements see capital resources and adequacy  below provides management with the flexibility to utilize the available for sale portfolio for liquidity and interest rate risk management needs  even during a period when valuations are depressed 
maintaining a fairly short duration in the portfolio also mitigates market risk 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility that bankshares will not be able to fund present and future financial obligations 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain the ability to meet commitments to fund loans  purchase securities and repay deposits and other liabilities in accordance with their terms 
core deposits and the available for sale investment portfolio are key elements in meeting this objective 
for the year ended december   core deposits  total deposits less certificates of deposit  and over  averaged billion 
this represents a increase over the billion average balance for the percentage of average loans funded by core deposits improved to in from in although not viewed as core deposits  a substantial portion of short term borrowings  comprised of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and commercial paper  originate from core deposit relationships tied to the overnight cash management program offered to customers 
by limiting the maturity of securities and maintaining a conservative investment posture  management can rely on the investment portfolio to help meet any short term funding needs 
us treasury and agency securities averaged billion in  a decrease from the average of billion the prior year 
these securities provide the greatest liquidity and represented of average earning assets for  compared to in in addition to these sources  bankshares has access to national markets for certificates of deposit  commercial paper and debt financing 
should it need to supplement further its liquidity  bankshares has billion in lines with the fhlb and back up commercial paper lines of million with commercial banks 
under covenants related to its and unsecured senior notes  bankshares is required to obtain approval from these note holders if it incrementally borrows in excess of million 
increases in borrowings as a result of businesses acquired do not count towards the incremental borrowing amount 
bankshares has rarely had a need to access this source of funding and would not expect its need to exceed this threshold in the near term 
bar chart bar chart capital resources and adequacy maintenance of exceptional capital strength has long been a guiding principle of bankshares 
ample capital is necessary to sustain growth  to provide a measure of protection against unanticipated declines in asset values and to safeguard the funds of depositors 
capital also provides a source of funds to meet loan demand and enables bankshares to manage its assets and liabilities effectively 
shareholders equity increased to billion at year end from billion at year end the increase can be attributed to the acquisition of f m and earnings growth offset by increased cash dividend payments 
book value per share was at december   compared to at december  the ratio of average equity to average assets was in and in  ranking bankshares among the most strongly capitalized banks in the industry 
excluding intangible assets  average tangible equity to average tangible assets was in and in the ratio in was lower than in due to million of the consideration for the f m acquisition being paid in cash 
the ratio was also negatively impacted by the increased dividends paid 
while maintaining exceptional capital strength and financing growth of the corporation  bankshares also has pursued a share repurchase program 
through december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares with  shares of common stock repurchased under these programs 
at december   there remained  shares of common stock authorized for repurchase 
the share repurchase program has supported management s strategy to enhance shareholder value 
management has repurchased shares in open market transactions and returned capital to shareholders in the form of dividends during periods when capital accumulates at a rate in excess of that required to support the growth of earning assets 
see footnote no 
of the financial statements and the statements of changes in consolidated shareholders equity below for details related to the share repurchase program 
various bank regulatory agencies have implemented stringent capital guidelines  which are directly related to a bank s risk based capital ratios 
by regulatory definition  a well capitalized institution  such as bankshares  faces fewer regulatory constraints on its operations than institutions classified at the other end of the spectrum as critically undercapitalized 
for instance  only well capitalized banks can accept brokered deposits without advance regulatory approval 
in addition  fdic deposit insurance premium rates are significantly lower for banks with higher capital levels  compared to poorly capitalized banks 
the risk based capital ratios graph above shows that bankshares has maintained capital levels well in excess of the regulatory minimum over each of the last five years 
for a further discussion of the regulatory capital requirements that apply to bankshares  see footnote no

bank regulatory agencies also impose certain restrictions on transactions among and between subsidiaries of bank holding companies  including extensions of credit  transfers of assets and payments of dividends 
historically  the dividend restrictions have not limited dividend payments at bankshares  and it is not anticipated that they will have a constraining effect in the future 
in addition to dividend restrictions  capital requirements are also affected by off balance sheet risks 
these include such items as letters of credit and commitments to extend credit

in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  which addresses the accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows for loans acquired in a transfer when those differences are attributable at least in part to credit quality 
it includes such loans acquired in purchase business combinations where there is evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination 
this sop requires the difference between expected cash flows and the purchase price to be accreted as an adjustment to yield over the life of the acquired loans  the difference between contractual cash flows an expected cash flows is not subject to accretion 
this sop would represent a change from current practice where the allowance for loan losses is carried over in purchase accounting
