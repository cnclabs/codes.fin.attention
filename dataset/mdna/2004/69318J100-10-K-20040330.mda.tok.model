our business to business marketing efforts are targeted to smbs  government and educational organizations  and medium to large corporate accounts 
as of december   we employed account managers  including new account managers with less than months of outbound telemarketing experience with us 
account managers are responsible for managing corporate accounts and focus on outbound sales calls to prospective customers

the overall us information technology market that we serve is estimated at approximately billion 
our consolidated sales represents less than of the it market  providing us with 
table of contents ample growth opportunities 
the largest segment of the market is served by local value added resellers vars  many of whom we believe are actively exiting the hardware and software business as margins have become too small 
we have transitioned from an end user or desktop centric computing supplier to a network or enterprise wide computing supplier 
we also have partnered with third party technology and telecommunications service providers 
we now offer access to the same services and technical expertise to our customers as local vars  but with more extensive product selection at lower prices  and therefore  we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share 
intense competition for customers has led manufacturers of pcs and related products to use all available channels  including direct marketers  to distribute products 
although certain manufacturers who have traditionally used resellers to distribute their products have established or attempted to establish their own direct marketing operations  including sales through the internet  to our knowledge  only one has replaced its traditional indirect selling channels as the principal means of distribution 
accordingly  we believe that these manufacturers of pcs and related products will continue to provide us and other third party direct marketers favorable product allocations and marketing support 
we believe new entrants to the direct marketing channel must overcome a number of obstacles  including the substantial time and resources required to build a customer base of meaningful size  quality  and responsiveness for cost effective circulation  the high costs of developing the information and operating infrastructure required by direct marketers  the advantages enjoyed by larger and more established competitors in terms of purchasing and operating efficiencies  the difficulty of building relationships with manufacturers to achieve favorable product allocations and attractive pricing terms  and the difficulty of identifying and recruiting management personnel with significant direct marketing experience in the industry

overview pc connection is a national direct marketing organization  offering a wide range of information technology products and services including computer systems  software and peripheral equipment  networking communications  and other products  and accessories that we purchase from manufacturers  distributors  and other suppliers 
we also offer a growing range of repair  installation  and other services performed by third party providers 
we operate through three primary business segments a consumers and small to medium sized businesses smb through our pc connection sales subsidiary  b federal  state and local government and educational institutions public sector through our govconnection subsidiary  and c large corporate accounts large account through our moredirect subsidiary 
we generate sales through i outbound telemarketing and field sales contacts by account managers focused on the business  education  and government markets  ii inbound calls from customers responding to our catalogs and other advertising media  and iii our internet web sites 
we offer normal trade credit terms to our public sector and established business customers and also accept most nationally recognized credit card payments by our customers 
we also facilitate lease financing by our business customers through third party leasing organizations 
competition although direct marketing represents a very small percentage of the total united states it market  the direct marketing of personal computers and related products is highly competitive 
we compete with other direct 
table of contents marketers  with established retail outlets  with manufacturers who regularly sell direct  and with manufacturers of personal computer products sold by us 
we currently believe that direct sales by these competitors will not have a significant adverse effect upon our net sales 
generally  pricing in the computer and related products market is very aggressive  and we strive to maintain prices at competitive levels  which may affect our gross profit margins 
in addition to these general competitive pressures  our gross profit margins are influenced by a variety of other factors  including the following the relative mix of smb versus public sector and large corporate account sales  inbound consumer sales versus corporate outbound sales within the smb segment  industry and segment pricing  particularly in the public sector  and variations in product mix and introductions of new products 
opportunities  challenges  and risks the weakness in demand for information technology products experienced by us in continued through and the first half of  resulting in overall conservative buying patterns  order deferrals  and longer sales cycles  as well as greater competition and slightly lower profit margins 
inbound telesales  which primarily serve our consumer and very small business customers in our smb segment  decreased significantly  particularly in  and are expected to continue to produce a declining percentage of our total sales 
with our sales representing less than of the overall approximate billion united states it market  we believe we have an excellent opportunity to grow and gain a larger share of this market 
we anticipate that most of this additional market share will come from smaller value added resellers  or vars  who have the largest share of the current it market 
we expect our expanding service offerings to compete effectively with these historical service providers 
we enjoyed a modest improvement in sales productivity average annualized sales per sales representative in and anticipate more significant productivity gains in the future 
with additional sales training  we expect our sales personnel to generate more add on sales  thereby increasing sales per transaction 
we believe we can then leverage this productivity against our relatively fixed cost structure  thereby increasing our profitability 
our public sector segment  however  faces a challenge to recover the momentum interrupted by the loss of a major government contract in late the general services administration gsa cancelled its contract with govconnection  following its review of that subsidiary s contract management system and procedures and the possibility of the sale of unqualified items and underpayment of required fees 
the gsa review and our own internal review is continuing 
revenues for under the gsa contract were approximately million 
we applied for a new contract with that agency during the federal government s typically low purchasing levels in the first quarter  in anticipation of receiving the contract in time to generate sales during the traditionally high third quarter federal government buying period 
the gsa shortly will initiate a pre award audit of the company s proposal 
although we expect the audit to begin shortly  the length of time it takes the gsa to complete this audit is not in our control 
accordingly  our sales of our govconnection subsidiary will be adversely impacted if a new contract is not approved prior to the third quarter of this matter is further discussed below in the section entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
the primary challenges we face in effectively managing our business are continuing our sales growth while reversing the downward trend of  and ultimately improving  our gross profit margins  improving the productivity of our sales personnel  and effectively managing and leveraging our selling  general and administrative expenses over a higher sales base 
we expect that successfully meeting all of these challenges will not be easy 
with only modest growth in the overall it industry  any significant sales growth must come through increased market share 
competition is expected to be even more intense in the future  which could put more 
table of contents pressure on margins 
we must avoid the risk of further margin deterioration while increasing sales 
we believe this is possible by implementing the initiatives described above 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated information derived from our statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales in millions net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring costs and other special charges income from operations the continuing decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of continuing competitive pressure on margins and on changes in product mix 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is the result of relatively fixed expenses spread over a growing sales base 
sales distribution the following table sets forth our percentage of net sales by business segment  sales channel  and product mix years ended december  business segment smb public sector large account total sales channel outbound telemarketing and field sales inbound telesales online internet total product mix notebooks pdas desktop servers storage devices software net com products printers printer supplies video  imaging sound memory system enhancements accessories other total 
table of contents gross profit margins the following table summarizes our overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of net sales  over the last three years years ended december  segment smb public sector large account total we had only one reportable operating segment in it is impractical for us to restate gross margin into the operating segments established in our smb segment experienced competitive pricing pressures  and offered a free freight promotion during part of  which contributed to its lower gross margin rate for the education marketplace in our public sector segment was highly competitive in  which reduced that sector s margin rate 
changes in moredirect s customer mix  together with increased supplier rebates  however  helped to increase our large account segment s margin rate for gross margin on sales to corporate accounts that purchase at volume discounts is generally lower than gross margins on consumer or smaller business sales 
gross margin on sales to public sector customers has historically been lower than that for commercial sales 
however  the gross profit dollar contribution per order is generally higher as average order sizes of orders to such corporate and public sector accounts are usually larger 
we believe that sales to larger businesses and public sector customers will continue to represent a growing portion of our business mix in future periods 
we also expect the migration of customers to our website to continue  which will continue to increase the percentage of online internet sales 
gross margins also vary by product mix 
sales of notebooks and pdas accounted for of our overall sales in  up from in this accounted for much of our decrease in gross margin for the year 
computer systems generally provide the largest gross profit dollar contribution per order of all our products  although they usually yield the lowest gross margin percentage 
for example  sales of computer systems result in a relatively high dollar sales order  as reflected in the increase in our average order size from in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  enterprise class products are sold to more sophisticated end users and generally carry higher profit margins than commodity type products 
sales of enterprise server and networking products included in the above product mix were   and of net sales for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we believe that sales of these product categories will grow as a percentage of our net sales  as customers further upgrade their network and communication infrastructures 
however  if economic conditions do not continue to improve in the near term  the sales growth of these types of products will not likely occur as we anticipate 

table of contents operating expenses the following table breaks out our more significant operating expenses for the last three years in millions of dollars years ended december  personnel costs facilities operations credit card fees depreciation and amortization bad debts other net  including advertising total percentage of net sales personnel costs continue to represent the majority of our operating expenses  with sales personnel representing the largest portion of these costs 
our other operating costs  except for credit card fees and bad debts  tend to be relatively fixed over changing sales levels 
our bad debt losses have decreased significantly from their high in  due to tighter credit management  lower customer bankruptcies  and an overall improvement in the economy 
most product manufacturers provide us with co op advertising support in exchange for product coverage in our catalogs 
although the level of co op advertising support available to us from certain manufacturers has declined  and may decline further in the future  the overall level of co op advertising programs has remained consistent with our levels of spending for catalog and other advertising programs 
we believe that the overall levels of co op advertising programs available over the next twelve months will be consistent with our planned advertising programs 

table of contents year over year comparisons year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased to  million in from  million in the increase was due largely to the inclusion of moredirect for the full year in but only from its early april acquisition date in had that acquisition taken place at the beginning of  net sales would have increased in by only 
changes in net sales and gross profit by business segment are shown in the following table dollars in millions years ended december  change amount of net sales amount of net sales sales smb public sector large account total gross profit smb public sector large account total net sales for our smb segment increased because we increased the number of sales account managers in the year while also improving average sales productivity per account manager 
sales representatives for the smb segment totaled at december   up from at the end of net sales for our public sector segment increased due primarily to a growth in sales to state and local government units and educational organizations 
sales to the federal government increased slightly from  which included first quarter sales relating to the september  disaster 
sales account managers for the public sector segment totaled at december   up from at the end of the cancellation of the general services administration contract described above did not have a significant impact on our sales  as most of the federal sales orders had been placed prior to the cancellation 
the increase in net sales for our large account segment is due to the inclusion of this segment for only nine months in moredirect was acquired in early april of  and accordingly  net sales for that company are included only from the date of its acquisition 
had the acquisition taken place at the beginning of  net sales for this segment would have been substantially flat over the two years 
sales account managers for the large account segment totaled at december   up from at the end of gross profit increased as shown by the above table  although the corresponding gross margin percentage of net sales decreased 
gross profit for the smb segment was substantially flat  as the increase from increased sales was offset by the decline in the gross margin rate  reflecting continuing competitive pressures and the shift in product mix shown in previous tables 
we expect to offset this decline in gross margin rates by increasing add on sales of accessories and other companion products to our system sales  as well as continuing to increase the level of enterprise product sales and sales of third party warranty  installation  and other services 

table of contents gross profit for the public sector segment increased due to the increase in sales discussed above  offset by a decline in the gross margin rate 
the decline in margin was attributable to aggressive sales growth promotions to state and local government and educational customers 
gross profit for the large account segment increased due to the increase in sales explained earlier  plus an increase in the gross margin rate 
this growth was attributable to changes in customer mix  plus higher rebates obtained from suppliers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in from but decreased as a percentage of sales in from the dollar increase is attributable to the inclusion of moredirect for the full year in  as explained above 
we have concentrated our efforts on managing our overall operating costs 
personnel costs generally account for approximately two thirds of our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as shown earlier in the table of sg a expenses 
while we plan to continue our focus on controlling discretionary expenditures  we expect that our sg a expense may vary depending on changes in sales volume  as well as the levels of continued investments in key growth initiatives such as hiring more experienced outbound sales account managers  improving marketing programs  and deploying next generation internet web technology to support the sales organization 
sg a expenses attributable to our operating segments are summarized below dollars in millions year ended december  change amount of net sales amount of net sales smb public sector large account total sg a expenses for the smb segment remained flat in with levels  while decreasing as a percentage of net sales from this segment has a relatively fixed cost structure  and the significant decrease in its net sales resulted in an unusually high expense rate for that year 
we believe that the smb segment s expense rate is higher than that for the other two segments  primarily due to lower sales productivity of its sales force and the additional costs associated with the level of its inventory procurement  stocking  and warehousing operations 
the smb segment can support a higher sales level in future periods 
the public sector segment s sg a expenses decreased slightly in while also decreasing as a percentage of net sales from this decrease is indicative of this segment s improvement in sales productivity by the generation of more sales per account manager and greater leveraging of its fixed costs 
sg a expenses for the large account segment increased in line with the full year reporting period in and the partial year period in discussed earlier 
sg a expenses for this segment represent the lowest of the three segments as a percentage of net sales  reflecting the nature and efficiency of this segment s variable cost field sales and drop shipping operating model

liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview our primary sources of liquidity have historically been internally generated funds from operations and borrowings under our bank line of credit 
we have used those funds to meet our capital requirements  which consist primarily of operational needs  capital expenditures for computer equipment and software used in our business  and more recently  earn out payments required under our recent acquisition of moredirect 
we believe that funds generated from operations  together with available credit under our bank line of credit  will be sufficient to finance our working capital  capital expenditure  and other requirements at least for the next twelve calendar months 
we expect our capital needs for to consist primarily of capital expenditures of between and million  payments on capital and operating lease obligations of approximately million and additional payments of approximately million under our moredirect merger agreement 

table of contents we expect to meet our cash requirements for through a combination of cash on hand  cash generated from operations and  if necessary  additional borrowings on our bank line of credit  as follows cash on hand 
at december  we had approximately million in unrestricted accounts and million in an account restricted to payments under the moredirect acquisition agreement 
cash generated by operations 
we expect to generate cash flows from operations in excess of operating cash needs by balancing net changes in inventories  receivables  and payables to generate a positive cash flow 
historically  we have consistently generated positive cash flows from operations 
credit facilities 
as of december   we had drawn million of our million bank line of credit 
this line of credit can be increased  at our option  to million for approved acquisitions or other uses authorized by the bank 
borrowings are  however  limited by certain minimum collateral and earnings requirements  as described more fully below 
our ability to continue funding our planned growth  both internally and externally  is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
while at this time we do not anticipate needing any additional sources of financing to fund our operations  if demand for information technology products declines  our cash flows from operations may be substantially affected 
see also related risks listed below under factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
summary sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the last three years in millions years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities decreased in and the primary reason for the decrease in was the increase in inventories  not fully offset by collections of receivables or increases in payables 
the higher amount in resulted primarily from a significant decrease in receivables  inventory  and other current assets from prior levels 
at december   we had million in outstanding accounts payable 
such accounts are generally paid within days of incurrence and will be financed by cash flows from operations or short term borrowings under the line of credit 
this amount includes million payable to two financial institutions under security agreements to facilitate the purchase of inventory 
we believe we will be able to meet our obligations under our accounts payable with cash flows from operations and our existing line of credit 
cash used for investing activities include our capital expenditures in the three years presented  primarily for computer equipment and capitalization of internally developed software 
additionally  moredirect was acquired in april  which accounted for million of the use of cash in we continued to use cash in to fund earn out payments due to the former shareholder of moredirect 
these payments totaled million 
cash provided by financing activities in related to an increase in our net borrowings by million under our bank line of credit  whereas there was no such increase in or further  our and financing activities included a million repayment of a note payable in each year and purchases of treasury stock aggregating million and million  respectively

it is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the actual agreements  which are on file with the securities and exchange commission 
for more information about the restrictive covenants in our debt instruments and inventory financing agreements  see factors affecting sources of liquidity 
for more information about our obligations  commitments  and contingencies  see our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report 
bank line of credit 
our bank line of credit provides us with a borrowing capacity of up to million  based on sufficient levels of trade receivables to meet borrowing base requirements  and depending on meeting minimum ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization and equity requirements  described below under factors affecting sources of liquidity 
amounts outstanding under this facility were million at december   these amounts bear interest at the prime rate at december  
substantially all of our assets are collateralized as security for this facility  and all of our subsidiaries are guarantors under the line of credit 
borrowing availability under the line was million at december  we recently negotiated an extension of this credit facility to december  and an option to increase the facility up to million 
this facility operates under an automatic cash management program whereby disbursements in excess of available cash are added as borrowings at the time disbursement checks clear the bank  and available cash receipts are first applied against any outstanding borrowings and then invested in short term qualified cash investments 
accordingly  borrowings under the line are classified as current 
inventory trade credit arrangements 
we have security agreements with two financial institutions to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions 
these agreements allow a collateralized first position in certain branded products inventory financed by these financial institutions 
although the agreements provide for financing up to an aggregate of million  any outstanding financing must be fully secured by available inventory 
we do not pay any interest or discount fees on such inventory financing  such costs are borne by the suppliers as an incentive for us to purchase their products 
capital lease 
we have a fifteen year lease for our corporate headquarters with an affiliated company related through common ownership 
we are required to make lease payments aggregating from million to million per year  plus real estate taxes  insurance  and common area maintenance charges 
operating leases 
we also lease facilities from our principal stockholders and facilities and equipment from third parties under non cancelable operating leases 
see the liquidity table below for lease commitments under these leases 
earn out provisions of moredirect merger agreement 
we completed the acquisition of moredirect in april under the terms of this agreement  we are required to make additional payments to the moredirect shareholder if certain earnings levels are achieved through december  earn out payments aggregating million are due in based on moredirect s earnings 
final payment will be due in if moredirect achieves its earnings target in

we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
the key factors affecting our internally generated funds are our ability to minimize costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies  timely collection of our customer receivables  and management of our inventory levels 
bank line of credit 
our credit facility contains certain financial ratios and operational covenants and other restrictions including restrictions on additional debt  guarantees  dividends and other distributions  investments  and liens with which the company and all of its subsidiaries must comply 
any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from borrowing additional funds under this line of credit  but would also constitute a default 
this credit facility contains two financial tests the funded debt ratio defined as the average outstanding advances under the line for the quarter  divided by the consolidated ebitda for the four quarters must not be more than to our actual funded debt ratio at december  was to minimum consolidated net worth must be at least million  plus of consolidated net income for each quarter since december  loss quarters not counted 
such amount was calculated at december  as million  whereas our actual consolidated stockholders equity at this date was million 
the borrowing base under this facility is set at of qualified commercial receivables  plus of qualified government receivables  less million of the formula availability which must be held in reserves 
as of december   million was available for additional borrowings 
inventory trade credit agreements 
these agreements contain similar financial ratios and operational covenants and restrictions as those contained in our bank line of credit described above 
such agreements also contain cross default provisions whereby a default under the bank agreement would also constitute a default under these agreements 
financing under these agreements is limited to the purchase of specific branded products from authorized suppliers  and amounts outstanding must be fully collateralized by inventories of those products on hand 

table of contents moredirect merger agreement 
the merger agreement with moredirect contemplates an earn out period of three years following the closing whereby if moredirect maintains certain earnings before income tax  or ebit  levels  additional payments will be made to moredirect s shareholder 
under the merger agreement  earn out payments are tied to ebit levels targeted to grow at a rate per year 
the maximum payment we would make for under the earn out provisions of the merger agreement is million  assuming moredirect maintains of the targeted ebit level for that year 
if moredirect maintains less than of the targeted ebit level for  no payment would be required under the earn out provisions of the merger agreement 
at any time during the earn out period  we may buy out the remaining earn out payments for amounts which vary during the term of the earn out 
we accrued a liability to moredirect s shareholder for million and million in earn out consideration for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also escrowed million at closing to fund a portion of these contingent payments  of which million was used to satisfy a portion of the liability paid by us in the first quarter of  and the remaining million will be used to satisfy a portion of our obligation to be paid in we believe we will be able to meet our obligations to moredirect and its stockholder under the merger agreement 
capital markets 
our ability to raise additional funds in the capital market depends upon  among other things  general economic conditions  the condition of the information technology industry  our financial performance and stock price  and the state of the capital markets 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the sec requires that all registrants disclose their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy has been defined as one that is both important to the portrayal of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
further  critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting policies described below fit the definition of critical accounting policies 
we have reviewed our policies for the year ended december  and determined that they remain our most critical accounting policies 
we did not make any changes to these policies during this year 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized at the point in time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred  and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain oral or written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
because we either i have a general practice of covering customer losses while products are in transit despite title transferring to the customer at the point of shipment or ii have fob destination specifically set out in our arrangements with federal agencies  delivery is deemed to have occurred at the point in time when the product is received by the customer 
we provide our customers with a limited thirty day right of return generally limited to defective merchandise

therefore  if the financial condition of certain of our customers were to deteriorate  or if we noted there was a lengthening of the timing of the settlement of receivables that was symptomatic of a general deterioration in the ability of our customers to pay  we would have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would negatively impact our earnings 
our cash flows would be impacted to the extent that receivables could not be collected 
in addition to accounts receivable from customers  we record receivables from our vendors suppliers for cooperative advertising  price protection  supplier reimbursements  rebates  and other similar arrangements 
a portion of such receivables is estimated based on information available from our vendors at discrete points in time 
while such estimates have historically approximated actual cash received  an unanticipated change in a promotional program could give rise to a reduction in the receivable 
this could negatively impact our earnings and our cash flows 
in  we adopted the provisions of the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  which addresses how a reseller of a vendor s product should account for cash consideration received from a vendor 
one part of this consensus spoke to the recording of estimates surrounding rebates or refunds 
the other part spoke to the classification of such items on the income statement 
the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
considerable judgment is used in assessing the ultimate realization of customer receivables and vendor supplier receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of a customer  vendor information  and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluations are incorrect  we may incur future charges to our income statement 
inventories merchandise inventories all finished goods consisting of software packages  computer systems  and peripheral equipment are stated at cost determined under the first in  first out method or market  whichever is lower 
inventory quantities on hand are reviewed regularly  and provisions are made for obsolete  slow moving  and non salable inventory  based primarily on management s forecast of customer demand for those products in inventory 
the pc industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product development that could result in increased obsolescence of inventory on hand 
increased obsolescence or decreased customer demand beyond management s expectations could require additional provisions 
this could negatively impact our earnings 
our obsolescence charges have historically approximated million per annum 
there have been no unusual charges precipitated by specific technological or forecast issues 
contingencies from time to time we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties 
we continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and would warrant accrual under the probable and estimable criteria of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in the most recent year  we have been subject to audit by the general services administration 
while we have accrued an estimate of our anticipated liability in the financial statements  such estimate is subject to change based on incremental findings by the government auditors 
any such change in estimate will impact both our results of operations and our cash flows 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles we carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet 
these are all currently classified as held for use 
these include property and equipment  identifiable intangibles  and goodwill 
an impairment review is undertaken on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  and on an event driven basis for all long lived assets including indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from such assets may be diminished 
we may review the 
table of contents carrying value of all these assets based partly on our projections of anticipated cash flows projections which are  in part  dependent upon anticipated market conditions  operational performance  and legal status 
any impairment charge that is recorded negatively impacts our earnings 
cash flows are generally not impacted 
over the last several years  we have incurred no significant impairment charges 
while we believe that our future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could materially effect our valuations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
employee compensation and benefits our employee compensation model has several elements that we would consider variable 
these include our obligation to our employees for health care 
we have selected a plan that results in our being self insured up to certain stop loss limits 
accordingly  we have to estimate the amount of health care claims outstanding at a given point in time 
these estimates are based on historical experience and could be subject to change 
such change could negatively impact both our earnings and our cash flows 
we also have granted stock options to our employees 
in general  such grants have been made at the current fair value of our stock and accordingly  given that we account for option awards under apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  no compensation charge has been recorded 
in previous years  most specifically those years prior to our initial public offering  there was a difference between the strike price of the option and the then current fair value of the stock 
this difference resulted in a fixed and determinable compensation charge 
we have not modified option grants in a manner that would cause either re measurement of the awards or the commencement of variable accounting 
as described in the notes to the financial statements  pro forma disclosure has been provided as if we applied the fair value methodology to option awards 
the recognition of compensation for awards especially if we were required by the accounting standard setters to adopt such a methodology in the future would have an adverse effect on our earnings 
we have also engaged in workforce reduction actions in each of the last three years 
these actions included formula driven termination benefits 
these benefits were or are being paid relatively quickly and have not been subject to change 
we do not foresee a circumstance where there could be significant variability in our workforce reduction estimates 
however  if we did experience significant variability  such change could negatively impact our cash flows 
recently issued financial accounting standards in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 application of eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers 
this pronouncement provides that consideration received by a reseller from a vendor in exchange for vendor sales incentives tendered by consumers should not be reported as a reduction of the cost of the reseller s purchases from the vendor 
vendor sales incentives as defined  are limited to incentives meeting the narrow definition provided in the eitf 
eitf was effective for all new arrangements and modifications to existing arrangements entered into or redeemed in fiscal periods beginning after november  the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
inflation we have historically offset any inflation in operating costs by a combination of increased productivity and price increases  where appropriate 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our business in the future 

table of contents factors that may affect future results and financial condition our future results and financial condition are dependent on our ability to continue to successfully market  sell  and distribute information technology products and services  including computers  hardware  and software 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that we must successfully manage in order to achieve a favorable financial condition and favorable operating results 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our future financial condition and operating results include  without limitation  the following factors we have experienced rapid growth in recent years followed by a decline in sales in and  and there is no assurance that we will be able to regain such rapid growth 
our net sales grew from million in to billion in in and  our net sales declined to billion 
in our net sales increased to billion  largely due to the april acquisition of moredirect 
we believe we would have experienced a greater decline in our net sales for if it had not been for that acquisition 
if our revenues decline again in the future  we may not be able to reduce our staffing levels and operating expenses in a timely manner to avoid significant losses from operations 
we may also experience quarterly fluctuations and seasonality which could impact our business 
several factors have caused our sales and results of operations to fluctuate and we expect these fluctuations to continue on a quarterly basis 
causes of these fluctuations include changes in the overall level of economic activity  changes in the level of business investment in information technology products  the condition of the personal computer industry in general  shifts in customer demand for hardware and software products  industry shipments of new products or upgrades  the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings  fluctuations in response rates  fluctuations in postage  paper  shipping  and printing costs and in merchandise returns  adverse weather conditions that affect response  distribution or shipping  shifts in the timing of holidays  changes in our product offerings  changes in consumer demand for information technology products  and changes in vendor distribution of products 
we base our operating expenditures on sales forecasts 
if revenues do not meet expectations in any given quarter  our operating results could suffer 
in addition  customer response rates for our catalogs and other marketing vehicles are subject to variations 
the first and last quarters of the year generally have higher response rates while the two middle quarters typically have lower response rates 
we experienced a loss of a major federal government contract in  which could significantly reduce our sales to that organization and negatively impact our business 
in november we were advised that the gsa cancelled its contract with our subsidiary  govconnection  following a review of its contract management system and procedures that may have resulted in 
table of contents the sale of unqualified items or underpayment of required fees 
the matter has been referred to the department of justice for review  and the company is cooperating in that review 
we have applied with the gsa to obtain a new contract  however  that agency will conduct a pre award audit of our contract proposal prior to awarding a new contract 
we expect this pre award audit to begin shortly  however the commencement of the audit and the length of time to complete the audit is not in our control 
accordingly  there is no assurance that we will have a new contract in place in sufficient time to avoid a loss in federal government sales  if at all 
if the new contract is not awarded prior to the traditionally high third quarter federal government buying period  our sales to the federal government would be adversely impacted 
revenues for under the gsa contract were approximately million 
we believe the gsa contract  if it had remained in effect  would have provided us with revenues generally comparable to the levels reported 
we are exposed to inventory obsolescence due to the rapid technological changes occurring in the personal computer industry 
the market for personal computer products is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements 
our success depends in large part on our ability to identify and market products that meet the needs of customers in that marketplace 
in order to satisfy customer demand and to obtain favorable purchasing discounts  we have and may continue to carry increased inventory levels of certain products 
by so doing  we are subject to the increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
also  in order to implement our business strategy  we intend to continue  among other things  to place larger than typical inventory stocking orders  and increase our participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
we may also participate in end of life cycle purchase opportunities and market products on a private label basis  which would increase the risk of inventory obsolescence 
in addition  we sometimes acquire special purchase products without return privileges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses related to obsolete inventory 
in addition  manufacturers are limiting return rights and are also taking steps to reduce their inventory exposure by supporting build to order programs authorizing distributors and resellers to assemble computer hardware under the manufacturers brands 
these trends reduce the costs to manufacturers and shift the burden of inventory risk to resellers like us which could negatively impact our business 
we acquire products for resale from a limited number of vendors  the loss of any one of these vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly through distributors and other sources 
the five vendors supplying the greatest amount of goods to us constituted   and of our total product purchases in the years ended december    and  respectively 
among these five vendors  purchases from ingram micro  inc represented   and of our total product purchases in the years ended december    and  respectively 
purchases from tech data corporation comprised of our total product purchases in the year ended december  and in both of the years ended december  and  respectively 
effective may   hewlett packard company hp completed its acquisition of compaq computer corporation 
our purchases from hp constituted of our total product purchases in had this acquisition been completed at the beginning of the periods presented  our purchases made directly from hp  on a pro forma basis  would have constituted and of our total product purchases in the years ended december  and  respectively 
no other vendor supplied more than of our total product purchases in the years ended december    and if we were unable to acquire products from ingram  tech data or hp  we could experience a short term disruption in the availability of products and such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
substantially all of our contracts and arrangements with our vendors that supply significant quantities of products are terminable by such vendors or us without notice or upon short notice 
most of our product vendors provide us with trade credit  of which the net amount outstanding at december  was million 
termination  interruption  or contraction of relationships with our vendors  including a reduction in the level of trade credit provided to us  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

table of contents some product manufacturers either do not permit us to sell the full line of their products or limit the number of product units available to direct marketers such as us 
an element of our business strategy is to continue to increase our participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
the availability of certain desired products  especially in the direct marketing channel  has been constrained in the past 
we could experience a material adverse effect to our business if we are unable to source first to market purchase or similar opportunities  or if we face the reemergence of significant availability constraints 
we may experience a reduction in the incentive programs offered to us by our vendors 
some product manufacturers and distributors provide us with incentives such as supplier reimbursements  payment discounts  price protection  rebates  and other similar arrangements 
the increasingly competitive computer hardware market has already resulted in the following reduction or elimination of some of these incentive programs  more restrictive price protection and other terms  and reduced advertising allowances and incentives  in some cases 
many product suppliers provide us with co op advertising support and in exchange we feature their products in our catalogs 
this support significantly defrays our catalog production expense 
in the past  we have experienced a decrease in the level of co op advertising support available to us from certain manufacturers 
the level of co op advertising support we receive from some manufacturers may further decline in the future 
such a decline could increase our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 
we face many competitive risks 
the direct marketing industry and the computer products retail business  in particular  are highly competitive 
we compete with consumer electronics and computer retail stores  including superstores 
we also compete with other direct marketers of hardware and software and computer related products  including an increasing number of internet retailers 
certain hardware and software vendors  such as hp  ibm  and apple  who provide products to us  are also selling their products directly to end users through their own catalogs and over the internet 
we compete not only for customers  but also for co op advertising support from personal computer product manufacturers 
some of our competitors have larger catalog circulations and customer bases and greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors offer a wider range of products and services than we do and may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies  and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition  engage in more extensive promotional activities  and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than us 
we expect competition to increase as retailers and direct marketers who have not traditionally sold computers and related products enter the industry 
we cannot assure you that we can continue to compete effectively against our current or future competitors 
in addition  price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer hardware and software market and we cannot assure you that we will not face increased price competition 
if we encounter new competition or fail to compete effectively against our competitors  our business may be harmed 
in addition  product resellers and direct marketers are combining operations or acquiring or merging with other resellers and direct marketers to increase efficiency 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 

table of contents we face and will continue to face significant price competition 
generally  pricing is very aggressive in the personal computer industry and we expect pricing pressures to continue 
an increase in price competition could result in a reduction of our profit margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher sales  cost reductions  or otherwise 
also  our sales of personal computer hardware products are generally producing lower profit margins than those associated with software products 
such pricing pressures could result in an erosion of our market share  reduced sales  and reduced operating margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the methods of distributing personal computers and related products are changing and such changes may negatively impact us and our business 
the manner in which personal computers and related products are distributed and sold is changing  and new methods of distribution and sale  such as online shopping services  have emerged 
hardware and software manufacturers have sold  and may intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to end users 
from time to time  certain manufacturers have instituted programs for the direct sales of large order quantities of hardware and software to certain major corporate accounts 
these types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various manufacturers 
some of our vendors  including apple  hewlett packard  and ibm  currently sell some of their products directly to end users and have stated their intentions to increase the level of such direct sales 
in addition  manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically to end users 
an increase in the volume of products sold through or used by consumers of any of these competitive programs or distributed electronically to end users could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we could experience system failures which would interfere with our ability to process orders 
we depend on the accuracy and proper use of our management information systems including our telephone system 
many of our key functions depend on the quality and effective utilization of the information generated by our management information systems  including our ability to manage inventory and accounts receivable collection  our ability to purchase  sell  and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis  and our ability to maintain operations 
interruptions could result from natural disasters as well as power loss  telecommunications failure  and similar events 
our management information systems require continual upgrades to most effectively manage our operations and customer database 
although we maintain some redundant systems  with full data backup  a substantial interruption in management information systems or in telephone communication systems would substantially hinder our ability to process customer orders and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on the continued development of electronic commerce and internet infrastructure development 
we have had an increasing amount of sales made over the internet in part because of the growing use and acceptance of the internet by end users 
no one can be certain that acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will adopt and continue to use the internet and other online services as a medium of commerce 
sales of computer products over the internet do not currently represent a significant portion of overall computer product sales 
growth of our internet sales is dependent on potential customers using the internet in addition to traditional means of commerce to purchase products 
we cannot accurately predict the rate at which they will do so 

table of contents our success in growing our internet business will depend in large part upon the development of an infrastructure for providing internet access and services 
if the number of internet users or their use of internet resources continues to grow rapidly  such growth may overwhelm the existing internet infrastructure 
our ability to increase the speed with which we provide services to customers and to increase the scope of such services ultimately is limited by and reliant upon the speed and reliability of the networks operated by third parties and these networks may not continue to be developed 
we depend heavily on third party shippers to deliver our products to customers 
we ship approximately of our products to customers by airborne freight corporation d b a airborne express  with the remainder being shipped by united parcel service  inc and other overnight delivery and surface services 
a strike or other interruption in service by these shippers could adversely affect our ability to market or deliver products to customers on a timely basis 
we may experience potential increases in shipping  paper  and postage costs  which may adversely affect our business if we are not able to pass such increases on to our customers 
shipping costs are a significant expense in the operation of our business 
increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could significantly impact the cost of producing and mailing our catalogs and shipping customer orders 
postage prices and shipping rates increase periodically and we have no control over future increases 
we have a long term contract with airborne express whereby airborne ships products to our customers 
we believe that we have negotiated favorable shipping rates with airborne 
we generally invoice customers for shipping and handling charges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on to our customers the full cost  including any future increases in the cost  of commercial delivery services such as airborne 
we also incur substantial paper and postage costs related to our marketing activities  including producing and mailing our catalogs 
paper prices historically have been cyclical and we have experienced substantial increases in the past 
significant increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could adversely impact our business  financial condition  and results of operations  particularly if we cannot pass on such increases to our customers or offset such increases by reducing other costs 
privacy concerns with respect to list development and maintenance may materially adversely affect our business 
we mail catalogs and send electronic messages to names in our proprietary customer database and to potential customers whose names we obtain from rented or exchanged mailing lists 
world wide public concern regarding personal privacy has subjected the rental and use of customer mailing lists and other customer information to increased scrutiny 
any domestic or foreign legislation enacted limiting or prohibiting these practices could negatively affect our business 
we face many uncertainties relating to the collection of state sales or use tax 
we presently collect sales tax on sales of products to residents in many states 
taxable sales to customers were approximately of our net sales during the year ended december  various states have sought to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales taxes on the sales of products shipped to their residents 
in  the united states supreme court affirmed its position that it is unconstitutional for a state to impose sales or use tax collection obligations on an out of state mail order company whose only contacts with the state are limited to the distribution of catalogs and other advertising materials through the mail and the subsequent delivery of purchased goods by united states mail or by interstate common carrier 
however  legislation that would expand the ability of states to impose sales tax collection obligations on direct marketers has been introduced in congress on many occasions 
due to its presence on various forms of electronic media 
table of contents and other factors  our contact with many states may exceed the contact involved in the supreme court case 
we cannot predict the level of contact that is sufficient to permit a state to impose on us a sales tax collection obligation 
if the supreme court changes its position or if legislation is passed to overturn the supreme court s decision  the imposition of a sales or use tax collection obligation on us in states to which we ship products would result in additional administrative expenses to us  could result in price increases to our customers  and could reduce demand for our product 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our future performance will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior executives 
the competition for qualified management personnel in the computer products industry is very intense  and the loss of service of one or more of these persons could have an adverse effect on our business 
our success and plans for future growth will also depend on our ability to hire  train  and retain skilled personnel in all areas of our business  including sales account managers and technical support personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract  train  and retain sufficient qualified personnel to achieve our business objectives 
we are controlled by two principal stockholders 
patricia gallup and david hall  our two principal stockholders  beneficially own or control  in the aggregate  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
because of their beneficial stock ownership  these stockholders can continue to elect the members of the board of directors and decide all matters requiring stockholder approval at a meeting or by a written consent in lieu of a meeting 
similarly  such stockholders can control decisions to adopt  amend  or repeal our charter and our bylaws  or take other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders and prevent a takeover of us by one or more third parties  or sell or otherwise transfer their stock to a third party  which could deprive our stockholders of a control premium that might otherwise be realized by them in connection with an acquisition of us 
such control may result in decisions that are not in the best interest of our public stockholders 
in connection with our initial public offering  the principal stockholders placed substantially all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them into a voting trust  pursuant to which they are required to agree as to the manner of voting such shares in order for the shares to be voted 
such provisions could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  our unsecured credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on the prime rate 
we had million in borrowings outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement as of december  we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows should not be material 
our credit agreement exposes earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
however  as noted above  million in borrowings were outstanding on the credit agreement at december   and the average outstanding borrowings during the year were not material 
accordingly  the change in earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates is not material
