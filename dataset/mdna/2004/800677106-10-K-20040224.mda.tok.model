overview we were incorporated in june from our inception through december   our activities related primarily to establishing and operating a biotechnology research and development organization and developing relationships with our corporate collaborators 
our scientific and business development endeavors currently focus on novel transcription factors for the regulation of gene expression 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  borrowings  payments from federal government research grants and from corporate collaborators and strategic partners 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our revenues have consisted primarily of revenues from our corporate partners for zfp tfs  contractual payments from strategic partners for research programs and research milestones  and federal government research grant funding 
we expect revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period and there can be no assurance that new collaborations or partner fundings will continue beyond their initial terms 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  laboratory supplies  allocated facilities costs  subcontracted research expenses  and expenses for patent prosecution  trademark registration and technology licenses 
research and development costs incurred in connection with collaborator funded activities are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
we expect these expenses will increase significantly as we focus increasingly on development of zfp therapeutics 
the company is also developing zinc finger nucleases zfn for therapeutic gene correction as a treatment and possible cure for certain monogenic diseases 
additionally  in order to develop zfp tfs as commercially relevant therapeutics  we expect to expend additional resources for expertise in the manufacturing  regulatory affairs and clinical research aspects of biotherapeutic development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  allocated facilities costs and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
sangamo believes the following critical accounting policies have significant effect in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition payments received to fund research activities made under strategic partnering agreements are recognized over the period that sangamo performs research services 
amounts received in advance under such agreements are deferred until the research services are performed 
sangamo s federal government research grants provide for the reimbursement of qualified expenses for research and development as defined under the terms of the grant agreement 
revenue under grant agreements is recognized when the related research expenses are incurred 
grant reimbursements are typically received on a quarterly basis and are subject to the issuing agency s right of audit 
sangamo recognizes revenue from its universal genetools agreements when zfp transcription factors zfp tfs are delivered to the universal genetools collaborators  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  there are no unfulfilled obligations  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  sangamo receives partial payments from these collaborations prior to the delivery of zfp tfs and the recognition of these revenues is deferred until the zfp tfs are delivered  the risk of ownership has passed to the collaborator and all performance obligations have been satisfied 
upfront or signature payments received upon the signing of a universal genetools agreement are generally recognized ratably over the applicable period of the agreement or as zfp tfs are delivered 
milestone payments under research  partnering  or licensing agreements are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of mutually agreed upon milestones  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii there are no further significant performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
revenue arrangements entered into after june   that include multiple deliverables  are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria is considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
stock based compensation sangamo accounts for employee and director stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and has adopted the disclosure only alternative of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
stock options granted to non employees  including scientific advisory board members  are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  which requires the value of such options to be measured and compensation expense to be recorded as they vest over a performance period 
the fair value of such options is determined using the black scholes model 
pursuant to fas  as amended by fas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  the effect on net loss and related net loss per share has been calculated  had compensation cost for stock based compensation plans been determined based upon the fair value method prescribed under fas see note organization and summary of significant accounting policies 
goodwill and patents impairment in connection with our acquisition of gendaq limited  in accordance with an independent valuation  we allocated million to goodwill and million to patents with estimated useful lives of years  the term of expected benefit 
the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for goodwill and intangible assets 
once the purchase price allocation is established  we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by fas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess if goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment in accordance with fas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include significant continued under performance compared to peers  significant changes in our underlying business and products  or other factors specific to each asset being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
we performed the first of the required annual impairment tests for goodwill as of september   which resulted in a one time charge being taken for the entire balance of goodwill of million 
given that goodwill was determined to be impaired  we also assessed our long lived assets for impairment at that time  resulting in an additional one time charge of million being taken for the entire unamortized balance of patents 
acquisition of gendaq on july   we completed our acquisition of gendaq limited  a privately held biotechnology company located in the united kingdom 
we issued  shares of common stock in exchange for of the outstanding shares of gendaq s common stock 
we also reserved a total of  shares for issuance upon exercise of outstanding gendaq stock options  which were assumed in the transaction 
gendaq had a research and development organization with a focus and research activities similar to ours 
in february  we made the decision to begin consolidation of our gendaq operations from the united kingdom to our richmond  california headquarters 
the decision followed a post acquisition review that was initiated in october where we evaluated technology  personnel  costs  and various alternatives to maximize the synergy between sangamo and gendaq 
as this review was initiated after the acquisition was completed  and the final decision to consolidate was not made until february  the decision had no impact on our accounting for the acquisition reported in the gendaq facility was closed september  results of operations years ended december   and total revenues total revenues consisted of revenues from collaboration agreements  strategic partnerships and federal government research grants 
revenues from our corporate collaboration and strategic partnering agreements were million in  compared to million in  and million in the decrease in from was principally attributable to lower year over year revenues of million associated with universal genetools agreements as well as lower year over year revenues of  recognized from a therapeutics partnership with edwards lifesciences corporation edwards 
total revenues decreased by  from to principally due to lower year over year revenues of  recognized from with edwards 
revenues attributable to milestone achievement and collaborative research and development performed under the edwards agreement were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
costs of the edwards partnership approximated revenues 
we expect revenues from collaborative agreements and strategic partnerships to continue to increase as additional agreements are signed or existing agreements are expanded 
federal government research grant revenues were  in   in  and  in the increase in represented the continuation of two grants  one of which began in and the other in we plan to continue to apply for federal government research grants 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease of million from to was principally due to the consolidation of the research activities at gendaq  our wholly owned uk subsidiary  into our richmond operations during the third quarter of specifically  decreased year over year expenses were salary and benefits of  lab supplies of  and facility related costs of  the decrease of  from to was also principally due to the consolidation of the research activities at gendaq  our wholly owned uk subsidiary  into our richmond operations during the third quarter of specifically  decreased year over year expenses were salary and benefits of  lab supplies of  and facility related costs of  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the future and expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our product candidates into clinical trials 
to the extent we collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
our current research and development programs are focused on the advancement of our zfp tf technology for several potential applications 
among these are zfp therapeutics for cardiovascular disease  neurological disorders  cancer and monogenic diseases 
zfp tf engineered cell lines for drug screening and protein production  zfp tfs for the discovery and validation of genes and drug targets  and zfp tfs for applications in agricultural biotechnology 
below is a summary of our programs and the development phase of the leading application program phase zfp therapeutics preclinical gene correction research zfp tf engineered cell lines for small molecule drug discovery research marketing zfp tf engineered cell lines for the manufacturing of protein pharmaceuticals research marketing discovery and validation of gene targets marketing agricultural biotechnology research general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million during  million in and million in general and administrative expenses were consistent over this three year period 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued growth of our research and development efforts 
restructuring charge restructuring charges of  related to the closure of the gendaq facility were recorded in these expenses primarily represent incremental employee restructuring costs and a loss on disposal of fixed assets of  impairment charges during  in accordance with fas no 
 the company performed the required two step annual impairment test of goodwill 
in the first step of the analysis  we compared the carrying value of the company to its fair value and determined that goodwill was impaired 
the fair value of the company was determined using the income approach 
the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of an asset  measuring the current value of the asset by calculating the present value of its future economic benefits such as cash earnings  cost savings  tax benefits and proceeds from disposition incorporating current equity market conditions in the united states  industry specific volatility factors  general equity market forecasts  the risk free rate for the use of funds and the expected rate of inflation 
the company recognized an impairment charge of million  representing the entire capitalized balance of goodwill at the time of the test 
fas requires that if an impairment test of goodwill and any other asset is required at the same time  impairment tests of all other assets should be completed and reflected in the carrying value of the company prior to the completion of the goodwill impairment test 
if it is determined that an asset is not recoverable  fas directs that an impairment loss should be recognized based on the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
impairment tests of the company s long lived assets were conducted in accordance with fas based upon the results of this review  we concluded that the carrying amount of patents was not recoverable 
the company recognized an impairment loss of million  representing the entire unamortized balance of patents 
management assessed all other assets as being recoverable 
in process research and development expenses as a part of sangamo s million cost to acquire gendaq  million was expensed as research and development in the third quarter of in process research and development represents that portion of the purchase price of the acquisition related to the research and development activities which i have not demonstrated their technological feasibility  and ii have no alternative future uses 
sangamo recognized an expense of million upon consummation of the transaction 
the amount of in process research and development was determined based on an analysis using the risk adjusted cash flows expected to be generated by the products that result from the in process projects 
the analysis included forecasted future cash flows that were expected to result from the progress made on each of the in process projects prior to the purchase dates 
these cash flows were estimated by first forecasting  on a product by product basis  total revenues expected from sales of the first generation of each in process product  as well as expected expenses to complete in process research and development for each project 
appropriate operating expenses and cash flow adjustments were deducted from the forecast to establish projected net cash flows for the in process technology 
finally  these net returns were discounted to a present value at discount rates that incorporate both the weighted average cost of capital relative to the biotechnology industry and the company as well as the product specific risk associated with the purchased in process research and development products 
the product specific risk factors included each product in each phase of development  type of molecule under development  likelihood of regulatory approval  manufacturing process capability  scientific rationale  pre clinical safety and efficacy data  target product profile and development plan 
the overall discount rate used for the purchase valuation ranged from to depending upon the stage of completion of each product and the risks associated with each  which represents a significant risk premium to our weighted average cost of capital 
the forecast data in the analysis was based on internal product level forecast information maintained by management in the ordinary course of managing the business 
the inputs used in analyzing in process research and development were based on assumptions  which management believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
a brief description of projects that were included in the in process research and development charge is set forth below 
projects subsequently added to the research and development pipeline are not included 
since the acquisition date  there has been no significant progress in the development of the projects listed 
at the time of the acquisition  management estimated that research and development expenditures of at least to million will be required to complete the in process projects 
project description indication phase of development estimated substantial completion date fair value in millions hiv therapeutic product candidate pre clinical anti inflammatory therapeutic product candidate pre clinical epo therapeutic product candidate pre clinical insulin therapeutic product candidate pre clinical functional genomics gene regulation product pre marketing agriculture gene regulation product pre marketing interest income  net net interest income was  in  as compared to million in  and million in the year over year decline over the three year period reflects lower average cash and investment balances due to the utilization of cash to fund operations 
other income during  other income of  was principally comprised of a gain on foreign currency translation of  an insurance settlement of  related to a equipment shipping claim and a research and development credit of  during  we recognized a net gain of  on foreign currency translations 
of that gain   represents cumulative currency translation recognized as a result of the closure of our gendaq facility in the uk prior to the closure of our gendaq facility during  currency translation gains or losses were reported as a component of equity 
we incurred net operating losses in   and  and consequently we did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from corporate collaborators  federal government research grants and financing activities such as a bank line of credit 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  investments and interest receivable totaling million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in  and million in in all periods  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to funding of net operating losses 
during  the use of cash related to the net operating loss of million was partially offset by non cash charges and net increases in asset balances of million and by amortization on investments of million 
during  the use of cash related to the net operating loss of million was partially offset by goodwill and patent impairment charges of million and million  respectively  as well as other non cash charges and net increases in asset balances of million 
during  the use of cash related to the net operating loss of million was partially offset by acquired in process research and development expenses recognized related to the gendaq acquisition of million  non cash charges and net increases in asset balances of million as well as amortization of deferred stock compensation expenses of million 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was  in  million in  and million in included in was million of net cash acquired in the gendaq acquisition 
cash was used during these periods to purchase investments and property and equipment and was offset by the maturities and sale of available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in  solely related to proceeds from issuance of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in and of  and  respectively  was related to proceeds from issuance of common stock  partially offset by payments made for an equipment loan 
while we expect our rate of cash usage to increase in the future  in particular  in support of our product development endeavors  we believe that the available cash resources  funds received from corporate collaborators  strategic partners and federal government research grants will be sufficient to finance our operations through as of december   sangamo had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through the company also has state operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in the years through the company also has federal and state research credits of  and  respectively 
the federal research credits will begin to expire in the year through and the state research credits have no expiration date 
utilization of the company s net operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases license obligations  total contractual obligations  operating leases consist of base rents for facilities we occupy in richmond  california 
license obligations consist of ongoing license maintenance fees and royalties due from sales of zfp tfs 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 

the interpretation establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities that function to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
interpretation applies to any business enterprise  both public and private  that has a controlling interest  contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity 
the provisions of interpretation no 
are effective immediately for all variable interests in variable interest entities created before february  and no later than the first fiscal period beginning after june  for all variable interests in variable interest entities created before february  the adoption of interpretation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on accounting for arrangements involving the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
specifically  eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement with multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the provisions of issue are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investments 
the investments are available for sale 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risks 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible within these guidelines 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade securities 
the portfolio includes marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
all investments have a fixed interest rate and are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
if market interest rates were to increase by one percent from december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by less than  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
we recognized a gain on foreign currency translation of  and  for and  respectively 
no foreign currency translation gains were recorded during
