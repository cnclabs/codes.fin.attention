overview shoe carnival  inc is one of the nation s largest and fastest growing family footwear retailers 
as of january   we operated stores in states in the midwest  south and southeast regions of the united states 
we offer a distinctive shopping experience  a broad merchandise assortment and value to our customers while maintaining an efficient store level cost structure 
our stores combine competitive pricing with a highly promotional  in store marketing effort that encourages customer participation and creates a fun and exciting shopping experience 
we believe this highly promotional atmosphere results in various competitive advantages  including increased multiple unit sales  the building of a loyal  repeat customer base  the creation of word of mouth advertising  and enhanced sell through of in season goods 
our objective is to be the destination store of choice for a wide range of consumers seeking moderately priced  current season name brand and private label footwear 
our product assortment includes dress and casual shoes  sandals  boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes for the entire family 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of both athletic and non athletic footwear  we are able to reduce our exposure to shifts in fashion preferences between those categories 
our ability to identify and react to fashion changes is a key factor in our sales and earnings performance 
our marketing effort targets middle income  value conscious consumers seeking name brand footwear for all age groups 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of popular styles of name brand merchandise at competitive prices  we generate broad customer appeal 
our cost efficient store operations and real estate strategy enable us to price products competitively and earn attractive store level returns 
low labor costs are achieved by housing merchandise directly on the selling floor in an open stock format  enabling customers who choose to serve themselves 
this reduces the staffing required to assist customers and reduces store level labor costs as a percentage of sales 
we prefer to locate stores predominantly in strip shopping centers in order to take advantage of lower occupancy costs and maximize our exposure to value oriented shoppers 
our fiscal year consists of a week period ending on the saturday closest to january unless otherwise stated  references to the years  and relate respectively to the fiscal years ended january   february   and february  fiscal years  and consisted of weeks 
critical accounting policies it is necessary for us to include certain judgements in our reported financial results 
these judgements involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the accounting policies that require the more significant judgements are merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
in determining market value  we estimate the future sales price of items of merchandise contained in the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in this determination include  among others  current and recently recorded sales prices  the length of time product has been held in inventory and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory 
the ultimate amount realized from the sale of certain product could differ materially from our estimates 
we also estimate a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and annually when no such event has occurred 
we evaluate the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than one year 
when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those assets  impairment losses are recorded 
when events such as these occur  the impaired assets are adjusted to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment  including current and future economic trends for stores  are subject to a high degree of judgement and if actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
deferred income taxes we calculate income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for the deferred tax assets 
we anticipate that future taxable income  and prior year taxable income during loss carryback periods  will be able to recover the full amount of deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate considers our judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various taxing jurisdictions within which we are subject to tax 
we have also been involved in tax audits 
at any given time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities

liquidity and capital resources our sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows s fiscal years net income plus depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes working capital increases other operating activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year our primary sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility

working capital increased to million at january  from million at february  the current ratio at january  was as compared to at february  long term debt as a percentage of total capital long term debt plus shareholders equity was at january   as compared with at february  the increase in working capital was primarily due to the increase in merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventories increased million to million at january  compared with million at february  during  our key merchandise strategy has centered on lowering merchandise inventory levels of seasonal fashion product in order to increase the merchandise margin 
while the number of stores in operation at the end of fiscal increased compared with the end of fiscal  merchandise inventories only increased 
this resulted in a decrease in merchandise inventories on a per store basis of 
this per store decline in inventory is in addition to a decrease in merchandise inventories on a per store basis at the end of fiscal capital expenditures  net of lease incentives  were million in  million in and million in these amounts include  and  of capital lease obligations incurred in and  respectively 
no capital lease obligations were incurred in of the fiscal capital expenditures incurred  million was for fiscal new stores   was for stores to open in fiscal  million was for remodeling and relocation of existing stores and approximately million was for technology 
the remaining capital expenditures in were primarily for various store improvements  loss prevention and distribution center equipment 
capital expenditures  including assets acquired through leasing arrangements but net of lease incentives  are expected to be million to million in fiscal the actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures depends in part on the number of new stores opened  the amount of lease incentives  if any  received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled 
the opening of new stores will be dependent upon  among other things  the availability of desirable locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending in areas we target for expansion 
in fiscal  we intend to open approximately to stores at an expected aggregate cost of between million and million 
the remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for store remodels  visual presentation enhancements and various other store improvements  along with continued investments in technology 
our current store prototype uses between  and  square feet depending upon  among other factors  the location of the store and the population base the store is expected to service 
net capital expenditures for a new store in are expected to average approximately  the average inventory investment in a new store is expected to range from  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
pre opening expenses  such as advertising  salaries and supplies  are expected to average approximately  per store in as compared to  in this increase is primarily due to an anticipated increase in advertising expense 
on a per store basis  for the stores opened during  the initial inventory investment averaged  and capital expenditures averaged  we recently completed a forward looking logistics study evaluating the need for additional distribution center capacity as we grow 
the results of the study identified the need to have additional distribution capacity available by the end of our current plan is to replace our existing  square foot distribution center with a new  square foot facility 
construction is anticipated to begin in the spring of preliminary cost estimates for land  building and equipment are approximately million 
no expenditures for this project are anticipated to be incurred in our unsecured credit facility provides for up to million in cash advances on a revolving basis and commercial letters of credit 
borrowings under the revolving credit line are based on eligible inventory 
borrowings outstanding under the credit facility were million at january  and million at february  letters of credit outstanding at january  were million 
as of january   million was available to us for additional borrowings under the credit facility 
on april   the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to march  we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our revolving credit line  will be sufficient to fund our planned expansion and other operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
significant contractual obligations as of january  and the periods in which payments are due include s payments due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations line of credit letters of credit capital lease obligations operating leases other commitments total contractual obligations see notes and as contained in part ii  item for a discussion of long term debt and leases  respectively 
our other commitments consist primarily of short term merchandise purchase commitments  in addition to those obligations related to capital expenditures for new stores  our deferred compensation plan and interest on capital lease obligations 
we did not enter into any off balance sheet arrangements during or  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at january  or february   except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business 
seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores 
non capital expenditures  such as advertising and payroll  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense as incurred 
therefore  our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre opening expenses related to the opening of new stores 
we have three distinct peak selling periods easter  back to school and christmas 
factors that may affect future results this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
a number of factors could cause our actual results  performance  achievements or industry results to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to general economic conditions in the areas of the united states in which our stores are located  changes in the overall retail environment and more specifically in the apparel and footwear retail sectors  the potential impact of national and international security concerns on the retail environment  changes in our relationships with key suppliers  the impact of competition and pricing  changes in weather patterns  consumer buying trends and our ability to identify and respond to emerging fashion trends  risks associated with the seasonality of the retail industry  the availability of desirable store locatio ns at acceptable lease terms and our ability to open new stores in a timely and profitable manner  higher than anticipated costs associated with the closing of underperforming stores  the inability of manufacturers to deliver products in a timely manner  changes in the political and economic environments in the people s republic of china  a major manufacturer of footwear  and the continued favorable trade relations between the united states and china and other countries which are the major manufacturers of footwear 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in that the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in market interest rates 
a change in the weighted average interest rate charged under the credit facility would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating by approximately  in and  in
