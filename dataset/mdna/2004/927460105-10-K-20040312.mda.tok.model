interest rate risk our interest rate risk exposure results primarily from short term rates  mainly libor based on borrowings from our commercial banks 
to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  we have historically maintained a portion of our total debt portfolio in fixed rate debt 
at december   all of our outstanding debt was at fixed rates 
however  we expect that this relationship will not continue and that a portion of our debt in future periods will be at variable rates 
in february  we redeemed a portion of our fixed rate debt with funds advanced under our revolving credit facility 
in the past  we have not entered into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or interest rate lock agreements 
however  we may consider these instruments to manage our portfolio mix between fixed and floating rate debt and to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates based on our assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner 
because we had no outstanding borrowings under variable rate debt instruments as of december   a change in the average interest rate of basis points would result in no change in our net income loss and cash flows before income taxes

index to financial statements foreign currency and operations risk international investments represent  and are expected to continue to represent  a significant portion of our total assets 
we currently have international operations in canada  argentina  bolivia  yemen  italy and bulgaria 
for  our operations in argentina and canada accounted for approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our revenues and percent and percent  respectively  of our total assets 
during  our operations in argentina and canada represented our only foreign operations accounting for more than percent of our revenues or total assets 
we continue to identify and evaluate international opportunities  but we currently have no binding agreements or commitments to make any material international investment 
as a result of such significant foreign operations  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  weak economic conditions or changes in the political climate in these foreign countries 
historically  we have not used derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge the risk associated with the movement in foreign currencies 
however  we evaluate currency fluctuations and we will consider the use of derivative financial instruments or employment of other investment alternatives if we believe cash flows or investment returns so warrant 
our international operations may be adversely affected by political and economic instability  changes in the legal and regulatory environment and other factors 
for example local political and economic developments could restrict or increase the cost of our foreign operations  exchange controls and currency fluctuations could result in financial losses  royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims could increase costs of our foreign operations  expropriation of our property could result in loss of revenue  property and equipment  civil uprisings  riots  terrorist attacks and wars could make it impractical to continue operations  adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses  import and export regulations and other foreign laws or policies could result in loss of revenues  repatriation levels for export revenues could restrict the availability of cash to fund operations outside a particular foreign country  and laws and policies of the us affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment could restrict our ability to fund foreign operations or may make foreign operations more costly 
we do not currently maintain political risk insurance 
however  we will consider obtaining such coverage in the future if we deem conditions so warrant 
canada 
we view the operating environment in canada as stable and the economic stability as good 
substantially all of our canadian revenues and costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
while the value of the canadian dollar does fluctuate in relation to us dollar  we believe that any currency risk associated with our canadian operations would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
the exchange rate at december   was us c as compared to us c at december  argentina 
beginning in  peronist carlos menem  as newly elected president of argentina  and domingo cavallo  as minister of economy  set out to reverse economic decline through free market reforms such as open trade 
the key to their plan was the law of convertibility under which the peso was tied to the us dollar at a rate of one peso to one us dollar 
between and the plan succeeded 
with the risk of devaluation apparently removed  capital came in from abroad and much of argentina s state owned assets were privatized 
during this period  the economy grew at an annual average rate of percent  the highest in the region 
however  the convertibility plan left argentina with few monetary policy tools to respond to outside events 
a series of external shocks began in prices for argentina s commodities stopped rising  the dollar appreciated against other currencies  and brazil  argentina s main trading partner  devalued its currency 
argentina began a period of economic deflation  but failed to respond by reforming government spending 
during  argentina s budget deficit exceeded billion and its sovereign debt reached billion

index to financial statements as a result of economic instability and substantial withdrawals from the banking system  in early december  the argentine government  with fernando de la rua as president and domingo cavallo as minister of economy  instituted restrictions that prohibit certain foreign money transfers without central bank approval and limit cash withdrawals from bank accounts for personal transactions in small amounts with certain limited exceptions 
while the legal exchange rate remained at one peso to one us dollar  financial institutions were allowed to conduct only limited activity due to these controls  and currency exchange activity was effectively halted except for personal transactions in small amounts 
in late december  as a result of political riots and upheaval in response to the banking restrictions  fernando de la rua was removed as president and the government was left in the hands of the peronist controlled congress 
peronist adolfo rodriguez saa  governor of san luis province was named as the transitional president and held power for one week 
during this time  he announced default on argentina s billion sovereign debt 
in early january  congress conferred power to peronist eduardo duhalde  who enacted temporary measures intended to achieve economic stability and avoid default on multilateral debts 
in addition  president duhalde set in motion a plan to transition the government back into the hands of an elected president on may   approximately six months ahead of the congressional mandate 
on january   the argentine government abolished the one peso to one us dollar legal exchange rate 
on january   decree created a dual exchange market whereby foreign trade transactions were conducted at an official exchange rate of pesos to one us dollar and other transactions were conducted in a free floating exchange market 
on february   decree unified the dual exchange markets and allowed the peso to float freely with the us dollar 
the exchange rate at december   was pesos to one us dollar 
the devaluation of the peso reduced our gas revenues and peso denominated costs 
our oil revenues remain valued on a us dollar basis 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in pesos at december   were as follows in thousands peso balance us dollar equivalent current assets current liabilities non current liabilities net liabilities on february   decree required all contracts that were previously payable in us dollars to be payable in pesos 
pursuant to an emergency law passed on january   us dollar obligations between private parties due after january   were liquidated in pesos at a negotiated rate of exchange which reflected a sharing of the impact of the devaluation 
our settlements in pesos of the existing us dollar denominated agreements were completed in and future periods will not be impacted by this mandate 
on february   the argentine government announced a percent tax on oil exports  effective march  the tax is limited by law to a maximum of five years 
the tax of percent is applied on the sales value after the tax  thus the net effect is percent 
during  we exported approximately percent of our argentine oil production 
we believe that this export tax has and will continue to have the effect of decreasing all future argentine oil revenues not only export revenues by as much as the tax rate for the duration of the tax 
the us dollar equivalent value for domestic argentine oil sales now paid in pesos has generally moved toward parity with the us dollar denominated export values  net of the export tax 
the adverse impact of this tax has been partially offset by the net cost savings resulting from the devaluation of the peso on peso denominated costs and is further reduced by the argentine income tax savings related to deducting the impact of the export tax 
the export tax is not deducted in the calculation of royalty payments 
we are required by law to repatriate to argentina percent of the export sales proceeds received in the us this requirement places no significant limitations on us because this provides us the pesos we need to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures in argentina

index to financial statements since may  many of argentina s important economic indicators have stabilized 
the central bank s foreign currency reserves have risen from a low of billion in to a recent high on february   of billion 
since being allowed to freely float against the us dollar  the peso reached its weakest value at pesos to one us dollar in june of  and has since stabilized  gradually appreciating to a value of pesos to one us dollar on february  monthly inflation has decreased from a high of percent for the month of april to an average of less than two percent per month from may to december with annual inflation during of percent 
inflation for all of was approximately percent 
after a year of negotiations  on january   the international monetary fund the imf executed a transitional billion  eight month stand by credit arrangement to provide financial stability through the presidential elections 
after a successful transition of government  and as a result of restoring a measure of economic stability and growth during  in september  the imf approved a billion stand by credit arrangement  to be disbursed in stages over a three year period  to succeed the transitional arrangement that expired on august  the economic program to which the argentine government and the imf agreed is based on a fiscal framework to meet growth  employment  and social objectives  while providing a basis for normalizing relations with creditors and ensuring debt sustainability  a strategy to assure strengthening of the banking system and facilitating an increase in bank lending  and further institutional and tax reforms to facilitate corporate debt restructuring and fundamentally improving the investment climate 
on january   the imf completed and approved its first review of argentina s performance under the three year program 
the second review is expected to conclude during march on january   at the argentine government s request  crude oil producers and refiners agreed to limit amounts payable for domestic sales occurring during the first quarter of to a maximum per bbl 
the producers and refiners further agreed that the difference between the actual price and the maximum price would be payable once actual prices fell below the maximum 
the debt payable under the agreement accrues interest at eight percent 
the total debt will be collected by invoicing future deliveries at per bbl after actual prices fall below the maximum price 
additionally  the agreement allowed for renegotiation if the west texas intermediate reference price exceeded per bbl for ten consecutive days  which occurred on february  on february   the agreement between the producers and the refiners was modified to limit the amount payable from refiners to producers for deliveries occurring between february   and march  while the per bbl payable maximum was maintained  under the modified terms refiners have no obligation to pay producers for sales values that exceed per bbl 
furthermore  interest for debts established during this period was reduced to seven percent 
this agreement has been extended to february  we believe that it will be further extended to april   during the coming weeks 
we sold approximately mmbbls of our net argentine oil production approximately percent under this agreement during we have not recorded revenue nor a receivable for any amounts above the per bbl maximum that have not yet been received 
repayments received from refiners will be recorded as revenues when received 
the plan set in motion by president duhalde to transition the government back into the hands of an elected president was successfully completed during may general elections were held on april   and a runoff election between the top two candidates  former president carlos menem and the then current governor of santa cruz province  nestor kirchner were scheduled for may  mr 
menem withdrew from the race and as a result  the runoff election was cancelled and nestor kirchner became president on may  president kirchner has achieved a high approval rating thus far among the argentine electorate and has achieved success with his efforts to reform the supreme court  to receive continued backing from the imf  and to build a stronger and more inclusive political base 
bolivia 
since the mid s  bolivia has undergone major economic reform  including the establishment of a free market economy and the encouragement of foreign private investment 
economic activities that had once been reserved for government corporations were opened to private investments 
barriers to international trade have been reduced and tariffs have been lowered 
a new investment law and associated regulations have been introduced for the mining and petroleum industries  intended to attract foreign investment

index to financial statements elections held during june marked the sixth consecutive democratic election in bolivia since  representing the longest period of constitutional democratic government in the country s history 
coalitions were formed among the two leading political parties allowing former president gonzalo sanchez de lozada to win the runoff election 
however  president sanchez de lozada failed to gain political support and consensus for his new administration 
in early  in an effort to control the budget  president de lozada proposed tax increases and cuts in government spending  which were met with violent protests 
after revising his budget plans and reorganizing his cabinet  the protests ended and president de lozada was able to negotiate terms with the imf for a one year stand by loan agreement for million  which occurred in april in august  in an effort to reestablish political support in congress  president de lozada accepted the resignation of his entire cabinet and named new ministers  including members of his rival political party 
in september  peasants  miners  coca farmers and labor unions held marches and demonstrations protesting the government s proposal to export gas to the us and mexico  and demanded the resignation of president de lozada 
after the protests turned violent and after the further loss of political support  president de lozada was forced to resign on october  in accordance with the bolivian constitution  the vice president  carlos mesa  was named president 
president mesa is an ex journalist and is considered an independent with no affiliation to the major political parties in bolivia 
furthermore  he has named independents to his new cabinet in an effort to break political deadlock 
since taking office  president mesa has demonstrated the ability to create consensus between the diverse groups within congress 
president mesa recently obtained congressional support clearing the way for a decree referred to as the law of constitutional reforms  which will establish a constituent assembly with broad representation who will be charged with forming a new bolivian constitution by president mesa s restructuring efforts have received financial support from the world bank  which has announced it will loan bolivia million over the next two years 
president mesa has promised to call for a referendum to vote on plans to export bolivian gas to north america  which is expected to take place by mid after presentation to the bolivian congress of a revised hydrocarbons law 
the government has stated its intention to revise the hydrocarbons law  in part  to increase taxation of the energy industry by as much as million per year 
in  the boliviano replaced the peso and became bolivia s currency 
the exchange rate is set daily by the government s exchange house  the bolsin  which is under the supervision of the bolivian central bank 
foreign exchange transactions are not subject to any controls 
the exchange rate at december   was bolivianos to one us dollar 
since our gas revenues are received in us dollars  we believe that any currency risk associated with our bolivian operations would not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the market for gas sales in bolivia is currently limited to exports to brazil via the bolivia to brazil gas pipeline and those internal gas sales necessary to meet bolivian industrial and consumer demand 
we are working to increase sales in both of these areas and currently have capacity to deliver gas volumes substantially in excess of our contracted volumes 
during the past several years  bolivian gas reserve growth has exceeded the demand growth in bolivia s existing markets 
therefore  we believe substantial competition for gas markets will continue at least until new market areas are established 
with president mesa s promise of public referendum on the matter of gas exports  we believe that new projects  such as exports to mexico  argentina and the us  will become feasible in the future 
yemen 
yemen has been classified as a low income developing country by the world bank 
trade and other external economic links have been limited  with the exception of the oil sector  which accounts for more than percent of yemen s gross domestic product 
the production sharing agreements under which private investors operate are clear and unambiguous  resulting in most of the country s foreign investment being concentrated in the oil sector 
the government has relaxed the broader regulatory environment to encourage additional foreign investments 
however  obstacles such as an insufficient infrastructure  continue to exist 
necessary economic reforms began during and were supported by both the imf and the world bank 
the reforms were targeted to enable a more market based and private sector driven economy and more integration into world markets  all within the context of broad financial and macro economic stability 
these reforms continue to influence yemen s economic policies today

index to financial statements yemen has taken significant steps to stabilize its political environment since the end of its civil war in the government is dominated by northern yemen  located in the capital city of sana a and headed by president ali abdullah saleh  who is a member of the general people s congress 
the general people s congress has held power since the mid s and regime change is considered to be unlikely 
civil society is relatively weak and tribal structures remain powerful 
concerns about terrorism and kidnappings are ongoing security risks 
we have evaluated the risk of operating in yemen and we believe that the current risks are manageable
