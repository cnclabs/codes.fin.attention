also  includes our lubbock pipeline volumes  the lubbock pipeline was acquired september  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed by markwest hydrocarbon on january  to acquire most of the assets  liabilities and operations of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business 
since our initial public offering in may of  we have significantly expanded our operations through a series of acquisitions 
we are engaged in the gathering  processing and transmission of natural gas  the transportation  fractionation and storage of ngl products and the gathering and transportation of crude oil 
to better understand our business and the results of operations discussed below  it is important to have an understanding of two factors the nature of the contracts from which we derive our revenues  and the difficulty in comparing our results of operations across periods  both because of our significant and recent acquisition activity  as well as the restructuring of our business in connection with our initial public offering in may our contracts for the year ended december   we generated the following percentages of our revenue and gross margin from the following types of contracts fee based percent of proceeds percent of index keep whole total revenue gross margin given the four acquisitions during the year ended december   the above percentages are likely to change 
we generate the majority of our revenues from natural gas gathering  processing and transmission  ngl transportation  fractionation and storage  and crude oil gathering and transportation 
while all of these services constitute midstream energy operations  we provide our services pursuant to four different types of contracts 
fee based contracts 
under fee based contracts  we receive a fee or fees for one or more of the following services gathering  processing  and transmission of natural gas  transportation  fractionation and storage of ngls  and gathering and transportation of crude oil 
the revenue we earn from these contracts is directly related to the volume of natural gas  ngls or crude oil that flows through our systems and facilities and is not directly dependent on commodity prices 
in certain cases  our contracts provide for minimum annual payments 
to the extent a sustained decline in commodity prices results in a decline in volumes  however  our revenues from these contracts would be reduced 
percent of proceeds contracts 
under percent of proceeds contracts  we generally gather and process natural gas on behalf of producers  sell the resulting residue gas and ngls at market prices and remit to producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based on an index price 
in other cases  instead of remitting cash payments to the producer  we deliver an agreed upon percentage of the residue gas and ngls to the producer and sell the volumes we keep to third parties at market prices 
under these types of contracts  our revenues and gross margins increase as natural gas prices and ngl prices increase  and our revenues and gross margins decrease as natural gas prices and ngl prices decrease 
percent of index contracts 
under percent of index contracts  we generally purchase natural gas at either a percentage discount to a specified index price  a specified index price less a fixed amount or a percentage discount to a specified index price less an additional fixed amount 
we then gather and deliver the natural gas to pipelines where we resell the natural gas at the index price  or at a different percentage discount to the index price 
with respect to and above  the gross margins we realize under the arrangements decrease in periods of low natural gas prices because these gross margins are based on a percentage of the index price 
conversely  our gross margins increase during periods of high natural gas prices 
keep whole contracts 
under keep whole contracts  we gather natural gas from the producer  process the natural gas and sell the resulting ngls to third parties at market prices 
because the extraction of the ngls from the natural gas during processing reduces the btu content of the natural gas  we must either purchase natural gas at market prices for return to producers or make a cash payment to the producers equal to the value of this natural gas 
accordingly  under these arrangements  our revenues and gross margins increase as the price of ngls increases relative to the price of natural gas  and our revenues and gross margins decrease as the price of natural gas increases relative to the price of ngls 
in our current areas of operations  we have a combination of contract types and limited keep whole arrangements 
in many cases  we provide services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described above 
the terms of our contracts vary based on gas quality conditions  the competitive environment at the time the contracts are signed and customer requirements 
our contract mix and  accordingly  our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices  may change as a result of changes in producer preferences  our expansion in regions where some types of contracts are more common and other market factors 
any change in mix will impact our financial results 
items impacting comparability of financial results in reading the discussion of our historical results of operations  you should be aware of the impact of both our significant and recent acquisitions  as well as the restructuring we completed in connection with our initial public offering in may together  these items fundamentally impact the comparability of our results of operations over the periods discussed 
our recent acquisitions since our initial public offering  we have completed four acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
these four acquisitions include the pinnacle acquisition  which closed on march   for consideration of million  the lubbock pipeline acquisition  which closed september   for consideration of million  the western oklahoma acquisition  which closed december   for consideration of million  and the michigan crude pipeline acquisition  which closed december   for consideration of million 
three of these acquisitions closed in the second half of accordingly  our historical results of operations for the year ended december  do not fully reflect the impact these acquisitions will have on our operations in future periods 
the aggregate impact of each of these acquisitions will fundamentally change our future results of operations 
contractual restructuring in connection with our ipo our financial statements reflect the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business on a historical cost basis for the years ended december  through our financial statements for the year ended december  reflect in part the results of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business on a historical cost basis for the period from january  through may  combined with our results for the period from may   the date of our initial public offering  through december  our results prior to may  include charges from markwest hydrocarbon for direct costs and allocations of indirect corporate overhead and the results of contracts in force at the time 
the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business predominantly consists of our appalachian operations 
our results of operations after our initial public offering differ substantially  primarily as a result of the contracts we entered into in connection with our initial public offering 
these differences are primarily driven by the way in which we generate revenues and the way in which the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business generated revenues 
historically  the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business generated its revenues pursuant to keep whole and percent of proceeds contracts 
in connection with our initial public offering  we entered into contracts with markwest hydrocarbon that replaced our keep whole contracts with fee based contracts 
entering into these contracts significantly impacted our financial statements before and after the date of our initial public offering 
the largest of the differences between the financial statements of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business and our financial statements is in revenues and purchased product costs 
generally  revenues and purchased product costs in the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business s financial statements are higher because the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business s revenues included the aggregate sales price for all the ngl products produced in its operations  and the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business s purchased product costs included the cost of natural gas purchases needed to replace the btu content of the ngls extracted in its processing operations and the percentage of the proceeds from the sale of ngl products remitted to producers under percent of proceeds contracts 
in contrast  after entering into the new contractual arrangements  our revenues related to these assets include just the fees we receive for processing natural gas  transporting  fractionating and storing ngls and the aggregate proceeds from ngl sales we receive under our percent of proceeds contracts  and our purchased product costs related to these assets primarily consist of the percentage of proceeds from the sale of ngl products remitted to producers under our percent of proceeds contracts  with a small portion of our purchased product costs attributable to natural gas purchases to satisfy our obligations under our keep whole contracts 
our facility expenses  similar to the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business  principally consist of those expenses needed to operate our facilities  including applicable personnel costs  fuel  plant utility costs and maintenance expenses 
one difference between our appalachian plant operating expenses and those of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business is fuel costs 
markwest hydrocarbon retains the producer fuel reimbursement related to these plants 
under the services agreement  we reimburse markwest hydrocarbon monthly for the general and administrative support provided to us in the prior month

our revenues were higher than our revenues primarily due to our acquisitions  which increased our revenues by million  partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new contracts entered into by us with markwest hydrocarbon concurrent with the closing of our may initial public offering 
purchased product costs 
purchased product costs were higher in primarily due to our acquisitions  which increased our purchased product costs by million  partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new contracts entered into by us with markwest hydrocarbon concurrent with the closing of our may initial public offering 
facility expenses 
facility expenses increased during primarily due to our acquisitions  which added million 
increased fuel expenses in appalachia and increased throughput at our michigan operations also increased facility expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased in principally due to increased non cash  phantom unit compensation expense  a result of an increase in our common unit price and the number of units granted and vested during  and the partnership s incremental costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
depreciation 
depreciation expense increased during primarily due to our acquisitions 
impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  our general partner s board of directors approved a plan to replace our existing cobb extraction facility with a new facility by the third quarter of consequently  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets  we wrote down the carrying value of the current cobb facility to its expected recoverable value 
interest expense 
interest expense increased during primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding debt 
most of our acquisitions were financed through additional borrowings under our credit facility 
income taxes 
the partnership has not been subject to income taxes since its inception on may   the date of conveyance of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business to the partnership 
the midstream business recorded a non cash adjustment of million to eliminate deferred income tax liabilities that existed at the date of conveyance of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business from markwest hydrocarbon to the partnership 
accordingly  the midstream business has recorded a benefit to the deferred tax provision for the year ended december   which increased net income by million

our revenues were lower in than in primarily due to the terms of the new contracts entered into by us with markwest hydrocarbon concurrent with the closing of the ipo 
on the percent of proceed contracts retained by the partnership  average ngl product sales prices were lower in the period than in the comparable period 
purchased product costs 
our purchased product costs were lower in primarily due to the terms of new contracts entered into by markwest hydrocarbon and us concurrent with the closing of our may initial public offering 
facility expenses 
our facility expenses increased in due to increased throughput in our michigan facilities and the expansion of our kenova processing plant 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased in principally due to the partnership s incremental costs associated with being a publicly traded company  as well as increased insurance costs 
depreciation 
our depreciation expense increased in principally due to additional fixed assets placed into service during the second half of income taxes 
income tax expense decreased because the partnership has not been subject to income taxes since may   the date of conveyance of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business to the partnership 
the midstream business recorded a non cash adjustment of million to eliminate deferred income tax liabilities that existed at the date of conveyance of the markwest hydrocarbon midstream business from markwest hydrocarbon to the partnership 
accordingly  the midstream business has recorded a benefit to the deferred tax provision for the year ended december   which increased net income by million 
seasonality with respect to our percent of proceeds  percent of index and keep whole contracts  which collectively accounted for approximately of our revenues and of our gross margin revenue less purchased product costs for the year ended december   we are dependent upon the sales prices of commodities  such as oil  natural gas and ngl products  which fluctuates with the winter weather conditions  and other supply and demand determinants 
a portion of the midstream business s revenues and  as a result  its gross margins  were also dependent upon the sales prices of ngl products  particularly propane  which fluctuate with winter weather conditions  and other supply and demand determinants 
the strongest demand for propane  which increases sales volumes  and the highest propane sales margins generally occur during the winter heating season 
as a result  the midstream business recognized a substantial portion of its annual income during the first and fourth quarters of the year 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and funds from private and public equity offerings are our primary sources of liquidity 
we believe that funds from these sources should be sufficient to meet both our short term working capital requirements and our long term capital expenditures requirements 
relative to capitalization  the partnership s objective is to maintain parity between debt and equity 
during december  financial institutions increased our maximum lending limit to million and  at december   we had borrowed million 
total partners capital at that date was million  and resulted in a long term debt to total capital ratio of 
during january  proceeds raised from a secondary public offering  were used to pay down the credit facility 
immediately after we paid down our long term debt with million from our january secondary offering  our long term debt to total capital ratio approximated 
the partnership has the ability to issue an unlimited number of units to fund immediately accretive acquisitions 
during  the partnership consummated four acquisitions aggregating approximately million that were immediately accretive and  accordingly  were partially funded by the aforementioned secondary public offering 
for acquisitions that are not immediately accretive  the partnership has the ability to issue up to  common units without unitholder approval 
our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders  to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of debt and equity financing which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our primary customer is markwest hydrocarbon  which accounted for of our revenues for the year ended december  consequently  matters affecting the business and financial condition of markwest hydrocarbon including its operations  management  customers  vendors  and the like have the potential to impact  both positively and negatively  our liquidity 
capital requirements the partnership has budgeted million for capital expenditures for the year ending december   exclusive of any acquisitions  consisting of million for expansion capital and million for sustaining capital 
sustaining capital includes expenditures to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives 
cash flow year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities was lower in than in by million  primarily due to the impact of the terms of the new contracts entered into by us with markwest hydrocarbon concurrent with the closing of our may initial public offering 
net cash used in investing activities was higher in than by million because of our four acquisitions  which aggregated approximately million 
for the year ended december   the partnership s financing activities used million 
those activities included million from the ipo and from issuance of bank debt  reduced by million paid to markwest hydrocarbon for capitalization of the partnership and distributions to unitholders of million 
for the year ended december   the partnership s financing activities provided million 
the partnership issued million of debt to finance its four acquisitions 
additional funds were provided by a private placement of common units for million  and an infusion by markwest hydrocarbon of million to fund pre construction activities at the cobb processing plant 
funds provided by these activities were reduced by distributions to unitholders of million

related parties you should read agreements with markwest hydrocarbon included in item of this form k for a complete description of the related party transactions we have entered into with markwest hydrocarbon  which is incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment applied to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical 
for further details on our accounting policies  you should read note of the accompanying notes to consolidated and financial statements included in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the long lived assets  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  estimating the fair value for the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than fair value determine the amount of the impairment recognized 
for assets identified to be disposed of in the future  the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if impairment is required 
until the assets are disposed of  an estimate of the fair value is recalculated when related events or circumstances change 
when determining whether impairment of one of our long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group 
our estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the volume of reserves behind the asset and future ngl product and natural gas prices 
the amount of reserves and drilling activity are dependent in part on natural gas prices 
projections of reserves and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  including but not limited to changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our products are located  the availability and prices of ngl products and competing commodities  the availability and prices of raw natural gas supply  our ability to negotiate favorable marketing agreements  the risks that third party or markwest hydrocarbon s in the case of michigan natural gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful  our dependence on certain significant customers  producers  gatherers  treaters  and transporters of natural gas  and competition from other ngl processors  including major energy companies 
any significant variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities under sfas no 
in general  sfas no 
was effective for the partnership on a prospective basis for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after that date 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that certain financial instruments previously classified as equity be classified as liabilities or  in some cases  as assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which it revised in december collectively  fin 
fin requires the consolidation of certain variable interest entities  as defined 
fin is effective for the partnership as of december   as it relates to special purpose entities  as defined  and in the first quarter for all other types of variable interest entities 
however  disclosures are required currently if a company expects to consolidate any variable interest entities 
we do not have investments in any variable interest entities  and therefore  the adoption of fin did not have an impact on our financial statements and is not expected to have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  you should carefully consider the following factors when evaluating markwest energy partners we may not have sufficient cash after the establishment of cash reserves and payment of our general partner s fees and expenses to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution each quarter 
a significant decrease in natural gas and ngl production in our areas of operation would reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
we depend upon third parties for the raw natural gas we process and the ngls we fractionate at our facilities  and any reduction in these quantities could reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
we derive the majority of our revenues from our gas processing  transportation  fractionation and storage agreements with markwest hydrocarbon and its failure to satisfy its payment or other obligations under these agreements could reduce our revenues and cash flow and in turn reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
the fees charged markwest hydrocarbon under the processing  transportation  fractionation and storage agreements may not escalate sufficiently to cover increases in costs and the agreements may not be renewed or may be suspended in some circumstances  which would reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
the amount of natural gas we gather and process and the amount of ngls we transport and fractionate will decline over time unless new wells are connected to the gathering systems serving our facilities  particularly in michigan 
our profitability is affected by the volatility of ngl product prices and indirectly by natural gas prices 
the highly competitive nature of our industry could cause us to lose customers and future business opportunities  thereby reducing our revenues and limiting our future financial performance 
our profitability depends upon the demand for our services and prices for our products 
we are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred on september   have resulted in increased costs  and future war or risk of war may adversely impact our results of operations 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental  safety and other regulatory matters  and the violation of or the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our profitability 
we are indemnified for liabilities arising from an ongoing remediation of property on which our facilities are located and our results of operation and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be adversely affected if the indemnifying party fails to perform its indemnification obligation 
due to our lack of asset diversification  adverse developments in our gathering  processing  transportation  fractionation and storage businesses would reduce our ability to make distributions to unitholders 
cost reimbursements and fees due our general partner may be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities  which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of our unitholders 
unitholders have less ability to elect or remove management than holders of common stock in a corporation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we face market risk from commodity price variations and also incur  to a lesser extent  credit risks and risks related to interest rate variations 
commodity price our primary risk management objective is to reduce volatility in our cash flows 
our hedging approach uses a statistical method that analyzes momentum and average pricing over time  and various fundamental data such as industry inventories  industry production  demand and weather 
a committee  which includes members of senior management of our general partner  oversees all of our hedging activity 
we utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  fixed for float price swaps and options on the over the counter otc market 
new york mercantile exchange nymex traded futures are authorized for use 
swaps and futures allow us to protect our margins because corresponding losses or gains in the value of financial instruments are generally offset by gains or losses in the physical market 
we enter otc swaps with financial institutions and other energy company counterparties 
we conduct a standard credit review on counterparties and have agreements containing collateral requirements where deemed necessary 
we use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
net credit exposure is marked to market daily 
we are subject to margin deposit requirements under otc agreements and nymex positions 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i ngls do not trade at historical levels relative to crude oil  ii sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments  or iii our otc counterparties fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas  ngls or crude oil or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly insulated against unfavorable changes in such prices 
we are also subject to basis risk  which is the risk that an adverse change in the hedging market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the price of the physical commodity being hedged 
basis risk is primarily due to geographic price differentials between our physical sales locations and the hedging contract delivery location 
while we are able to hedge our basis risk for natural gas commodity transactions in the readily available natural gas financial marketplace  similar markets do not exist for hedging basis risk on ngl products 
ngl product basis risk also results from the difference in relative price movements between crude oil and ngl products 
we may use crude oil  instead of ngl products  in our hedges because the ngl hedge products and markets are limited 
crude oil is typically highly correlated with certain ngl products 
we hedge our ngl product sales by selling forward propane or crude oil 
as of december   we have hedged natural gas sales as follows year ending december  hedged natural gas sales natural gas mmbtu natural gas sales price per mmbtu natural gas puts natural gas mmbtu natural gas sales price per mmbtu na total hedged natural gas natural gas mmbtu natural gas sales price per mmbtu all projected margins or prices on open positions assume a the basis differentials between our sales location and the hedging contract s specified location  and b the correlation between crude oil and ngl products  are consistent with historical averages 
interest rate we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our long term debt with floating interest rates 
we may make use of interest rate swap agreements  during the term of the partnership credit facility that matures on november   to adjust the ratio of fixed and floating rates in the debt portfolio 
as of december   we are a party to contracts that fix interest rates on million of our debt at through may  compared to floating libor plus an applicable margin 
sensitivities our annual sensitivities to changes in commodity prices considering our hedge position are as follows for every per mmbtu increase in the natural gas price  our gross margin  exclusive of our arapaho processing plant  would decrease by million  and for every per gallon reduction in ngl prices  exclusive of our arapaho processing plant  our gross margin would decrease by million 
our arapaho plant processing margins are sensitive to commodity price changes 
because of the nature of the contracts associated with the plant  our gross margin increases as the price of ngls increases relative to natural gas and our gross margin decreases as the price of natural gas increases relative to the price of ngls 
in the latter case  however  we have the option of not operating the plant in a low processing margin environment since the btu content of the inlet natural gas meets the btu specification of the interstate line into which the natural gas is delivered 
a per mcf change in the processing margin results in a million change in gross margin
