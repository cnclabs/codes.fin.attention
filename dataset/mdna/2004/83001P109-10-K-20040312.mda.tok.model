item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents factors  which we believe are relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item we adopted fin during the fourth quarter of as a result  the results of six flags over georgia  six flags over texas  six flags marine world and six flags white water atlanta  which were previously accounted for by the equity method  are now consolidated 
those financial statements and this discussion and analysis reflect our retroactive reclassification of our prior year results upon the adoption of fin to enable meaningful year to year comprisons 
general our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of tickets for entrance to our parks approximately of revenues in and the sale of food  merchandise  games and attractions inside our parks 
our results were negatively affected by the persistently sluggish economy  which affected both group sales attendance and individual visitations as well as the impact of significantly above average rainfall and below average temperatures in a number of our major markets in may and june 
although performance at our parks improved in the second half of the season  attendance for the year declined by compared to the prior year 
our attendance decline in was partially offset by a increase in per capita spending 
our principal costs of operations include salaries and wages  employee benefits  advertising  outside services  maintenance  utilities and insurance 
our expenses are relatively fixed 
costs for full time employees  maintenance  utilities  advertising and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance 
accordingly  although we controlled variable expenses in  we were generally unable to reduce overall operating costs and expenses to offset the impact of reduced attendance 
due to our disappointing performance in  we were unable to reduce the aggregate level of our indebtedness during the year 
however  we were able to effect an amendment to our credit agreement and refinance two series of public debt 
the amendment relaxed covenants relating to the leverage ratio through and the fixed charge coverage ratio through mid  providing us additional financial flexibility in light of recent operating conditions 
the refinancings resulted in extending the nearest maturity on our public debt to february we plan to make approximately million of capital expenditures for the season 
in addition to additions of rides and attractions at parks  we plan to make improvements systemwide designed to enhance guest services generally 
we have also retained a new advertising agency and will be introducing new marketing and advertising campaigns for our season 
results of operations summary data for the years ended december were as follows in thousands  except per capital revenue summary of operations percentage changes v

revenue in totaled  million compared to  million for the performance reflects the inclusion of six flags new orleans which was acquired in august for the full year 
excluding the new orleans park from both years  revenue decreased by million in  with attendance down by and per capita revenues up by 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for increased million compared to expenses for excluding the expenses at the new orleans park from both years  operating expenses in increased million as compared to the prior year primarily reflecting increased wage expense and fringe benefit expense relating to pension and medical benefits and the impact of exchange rates 
selling  general and administrative  noncash compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million compared to comparable expenses for excluding the expenses at the new orleans park from both years  selling  general and administrative expenses in increased million as compared to the prior year largely as a result of increased expenditures in advertising  insurance and real estate taxes and the impact of exchange rates 
noncash compensation in primarily reflects the final amortization of shares of restricted stocks previously granted 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold in decreased million compared to costs for  notwithstanding a small increase in theme park food  merchandise and other revenue in as a percentage of theme park food  merchandise and other revenue  costs of products sold were approximately and  respectively  in and depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased million compared to the increase compared to the level was attributable to additional expense associated with six flags new orleans as well as our on going capital program 
interest expense  net of interest income  early repurchase of debt 
interest expense  net decreased million compared to  reflecting lower cost of funds and the incurrence of additional interest expense in related to a new note issue  the proceeds of which were applied to retire other outstanding notes approximately days after issuance of the new notes 
expenses relating to early repurchase of debt which are now shown before giving effect to the related tax benefit and were formerly accounted for as an extraordinary loss and shown on a net basis were million less in than in the prior year 
the expenses in both years reflect the refinancing of public debt 
we refinance our public debt primarily to extend maturities 
minority interest 
minority interest reflects third party share of the operations of the parks that are not wholly owned by us  six flags over georgia including white water atlanta  six flags over texas and six flags marine world 
cash distributions to our partners and joint venturer were million in and million in income tax benefit 
income tax benefit was million for compared to a million benefit for the effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate is impacted by the level of income or loss in each jurisdiction and each jurisdiction s tax rate 
in  the tax rate was also negatively impacted by nondeductible compensation expense 
at december   we estimated that we had approximately  million of net operating losses nols carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
the nols are subject to review and potential disallowance by the internal revenue service upon audit of our federal income tax returns and those of our subsidiaries 
in addition  the use of nols is subject to limitations on the amount of taxable income that can be offset with the nols 
some of the nols also are subject to a limitation as to which of the subsidiaries income the nols are permitted to offset 
although no assurance can be given as to the timing or amount of the availability of the nols to us and our subsidiaries  we anticipate that it is more likely than not that virtually all of the nols will be utilized prior to their expiration 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue in totaled  million compared to  million for  reflecting primarily an decrease in attendance offset in part by a increase in total per capita spending  reflecting growth both in admission per capita and in park and other revenue per capita 
the attendance shortfall was most pronounced at three parks  reflecting the impact of the difficult economy  particularly in group outings business  and other market specific performance issues 
excluding revenues at six flags new orleans acquired on august   revenues in would have decreased million or 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for increased million compared to expenses for the increase resulted from the inclusion for the entire year of the former sea world of ohio  which was acquired in february  and la ronde  acquired in may  as well as the inclusion in of expenses at six flags new orleans subsequent to the august  acquisition of that park 
the sea world facility was combined with our adjacent six flags park in after its acquisition 
assuming that the sea world and la ronde parks had been owned for the entire year and excluding expenses at six flags new orleans for  operating expenses in would have decreased million as compared to the pro forma prior year 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million compared to comparable expenses for assuming that the sea world and la ronde parks had been owned for the entire year and excluding expenses at six flags new orleans for  selling  general and administrative expenses in would have increased million as compared to the pro forma prior year 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold in decreased million compared to costs for  reflecting primarily the slight decrease in theme park food  merchandise and other revenue in as a percentage of theme park food  merchandise and other revenue  costs of products sold were approximately and  respectively  in and depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for decreased million compared to the decrease compared to the level was attributable to the elimination of amortization of goodwill in see critical accounting issues valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill and note to notes to consolidated financial statements  offset in part by a million increase in depreciation expense in interest expense  net of interest income  early repurchase of debt 
interest expense  net increased million compared to the increase compared to interest expense  net for resulted primarily from a decrease in in interest income compared to the prior year as well as the short term effects of our february refinancing of million of debt with the proceeds of our issuance of million principal amount of senior notes due because the related redemption of the refinanced notes was not effected until april  the earliest date the notes could be redeemed  interest expense on these notes continued to accrue through the end of the first quarter of the expense for early repurchase of debt reflects the refinancing of public debt in both years 
we refinance our public debt primarily to extend maturities 
minority interest 
minority interest reflects third party share of the parks that are not wholly owned  six flags over georgia including white water atlanta  six flags over texas and six flags marine world 
cash distributions to our partners and joint venturer were million in and million in income tax benefit 
income tax benefit was million for compared to a million benefit for prior to  our effective tax rate was adversely affected by the result of permanent differences associated with goodwill amortization for financial purposes and the lesser amount of amortization that is deductible for tax purposes and by nondeductible compensation expense associated with conditional stock options and restricted stock grants 
during  our effective tax rate was adversely impacted by such nondeductible compensation expense and the limited recognition of tax benefits from our european operations 
liquidity  capital commitments and resources general our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  funds from borrowings and existing cash on hand 
our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations  debt service  investments in parks including capital projects and acquisitions  preferred stock dividends and payments to our partners in the partnership parks 
we did not pay a dividend on our common stock during  nor do we expect to pay one in we believe that  based on historical and anticipated operating results  cash flows from operations  available cash and available amounts under our credit agreement will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs  including anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  scheduled debt and preferred stock requirements and obligations under arrangements relating to the partnership parks  for at least the next several years 
our current and future liquidity is  however  greatly dependent upon our operating results  which are driven largely by overall economic conditions as well as the price and perceived quality of the entertainment experience at our parks 
our liquidity could also be adversely affected by unfavorable weather  accidents or the occurrence of an event or condition  including terrorist acts or threats  negative publicity or significant local competitive events  that significantly reduces paid attendance and  therefore  revenue at any of our theme parks 
see business risk factors 
in that case  we might need to seek additional financing 
in addition  we expect to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt on or prior to maturity and to seek additional financing 
the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain any new financing or to effect any such refinancing 
at december  after giving effect to the million increase in the term loan portion of our credit facility and the redemption of the notes  each occurring in january  our total debt would have aggregated  million  of which approximately million was scheduled to mature prior to december  based on interest rates at december  for floating rate debt and after giving effect to the interest rate swaps described below  annual cash interest payments for on this debt will aggregate approximately million 
in addition  annual dividend payments on our outstanding preferred stock are million  payable at our option in cash or shares of common stock 
we plan on spending approximately million on capital expenditures for the season 
at december   we had approximately million of cash not including cash held for retirement of debt which had been called for prepayment and million available under our credit facility 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  we are largely dependent upon our million working capital revolving credit portion of our credit agreement in order to fund off season expenses 
our ability to borrow under the working capital revolver is dependent upon compliance with certain conditions  including financial ratios and the absence of any material adverse change 
we are currently in compliance with all of these conditions 
if we were to become unable to borrow under the facility  we would likely be unable to pay in full our off season obligations 
the working capital facility expires in june the terms and availability of our credit facility and other indebtedness would not be affected by a change in the ratings issued by rating agencies in respect of our indebtedness 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
since our business is both seasonal and involves significant levels of cash transactions  factors impacting our net operating cash flows are the same as those impacting our cash based revenues and expenses discussed above 
net cash used in investing activities in was million 
excluding the purchase of million of investments from the proceeds of the december note offering pending the january redemption of the notes  investment activity consisted primarily of million of capital expenditures  offset in part by the million of previously restricted cash which under the applicable contract became unrestricted on april  net cash provided by financing activities in was million  representing primarily million in proceeds of the issuance of public debt and borrowings under the credit facility  offset in part by the redemption of million of public debt  repayments of borrowing under our credit facility  payment of preferred stock dividends and payment of debt issuance costs 
long term debt and preferred stock after giving effect to the million increase in the term loan portion of our credit facility and the redemption of the notes  each occurring in january  our debt at december  included  million of fixed rate senior notes  with staggered maturities ranging from to  million under our credit facility and million of other indebtedness  including million of indebtedness at six flags over texas and six flags over georgia 
except in certain circumstances  the public debt instruments do not require principal payments prior to maturity 
our credit facility includes a million term loan increased to million in january all of which was outstanding at december  and january   a million multicurrency reducing revolver facility none outstanding at december  and a million working capital revolver none of which was outstanding at that date 
the working capital facility must be repaid in full for consecutive days during each year and terminates on june  the multicurrency reducing revolving credit facility  which permits optional prepayments and reborrowings  requires quarterly mandatory reductions in the initial commitment together with repayments  to the extent that the outstanding borrowings thereunder would exceed the reduced commitment of of the committed amount thereof commencing on december   commencing on march   commencing on march  and commencing on march  and this facility terminates on june  the term loan facility requires quarterly repayments of of the outstanding amount thereof commencing on september  and commencing on september  the term loan matures on june  under the credit facility  the maturity of the term loan will be shortened to august  and december   respectively if prior to such dates i we do not repay or refinance our million senior notes due or ii our outstanding preferred stock is not converted or redeemed 
all of our outstanding preferred stock million liquidation preference must be redeemed on august  to the extent not previously converted into common stock 
see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our indebtedness and preferred stock 
partnership park obligations as more fully described in business partnership park arrangements in connection with our acquisition of the former six flags  we guaranteed certain obligations relating to six flags over georgia and six flags over texas 
these obligations continue until  in the case of the georgia park and  in the case of the texas park 
among such obligations are i minimum annual distributions including rent of approximately million in subject to cost of living adjustments in subsequent years to partners in these two partnerships parks of which we will be entitled to receive in approximately million based on our present ownership of of the georgia partnership and of the texas partnership  ii minimum capital expenditures at each park during rolling five year periods based generally on of park revenues  and iii an annual offer to purchase a maximum number of per year accumulating to the extent not purchased in any given year of limited partnership units at specified prices 
we plan to make approximately million of capital expenditures at these parks for the season  an amount in excess of the minimum required expenditure 
because we have not been required since to purchase a material amount of units  our maximum unit purchase obligation for both parks in is an aggregate of approximately million  representing approximately of the outstanding units of the georgia park and of the outstanding units of the texas park 
the annual unit purchase obligation without taking into account accumulation from prior years aggregates approximately million for both parks based on current purchase prices 
as we purchase additional units  we are entitled to a proportionate increase in our share of the minimum annual distributions 
cash flows from operations at these partnership parks will be used to satisfy the annual distribution and capital expenditure requirements  before any funds are required from us 
the two partnerships generated approximately million of aggregate ebitda during at december   we had total loans outstanding of million to the partnerships that own these parks  primarily to fund the acquisition of six flags white water atlanta and to make capital improvements 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations as of december   we were not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements 
set forth below is certain information regarding our debt  preferred stock and lease obligations at december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations and beyond total long term debt piers real estate and operating leases total in addition to the debt  preferred stock and lease obligations set forth in the table above and our commitments to the partnerships that own six flags over texas and six flags over georgia discussed above  our contractual commitments include commitments for license fees to warner bros 
and commitments relating to capital expenditures 
license fees to warner bros 
for our domestic parks aggregate million annually through after that season  the license fee is payable based upon the number of domestic parks utilizing the licensed characters 
the license fee relating to our international parks is based on percentages of the revenues of the international parks utilizing the characters 
for  license fees for our international parks aggregated million 
we have prepaid approximately million of the international license fees 
during the years ended december  and  we made contributions to our defined benefit plan of million and million  respectively 
see note to notes to conselidated financial statments 
although we are contractually committed to make specified levels of capital expenditures at selected parks for the next several years  the vast majority of our capital expenditures in and beyond includes the million increase in the term loan portion of our credit facility in january and excludes the notes redeemed in full in that month 
also includes capital lease obligations 
payments are shown at principal amount 
payments shown do not include interest payments or principal payments on our working capital revolver  no borrowings under which were outstanding at december  the million working capital revolver must be repaid in full for consecutive days in each year 
obligations not denominated in us dollars have been converted based on the exchange rates existing on december  amount shown excludes annual dividends of approximately million  which we are permitted to pay in either cash or common stock 
the amount shown for the cash redemption obligations assumes no conversion of piers prior thereto 
assumes for lease payments based on a percentage of revenues  future payments at revenue levels 
also does not give effect to cost of living adjustments 
obligations not denominated in us dollars have been converted based on the exchange rates existing on december  will be made on a discretionary basis 
we plan on spending approximately million on capital expenditures for the season 
during the three years ended december   insurance premiums and self insurance retention levels increased substantially 
however  as compared to the prior policies  the current policies  which expire in october  cover substantially the same risks neither property insurance policy covered terrorist activities  do not require higher aggregate premiums and do not have substantially larger self insurance retentions liability insurance retentions increased from million to million per occurrence and workers compensation retentions increased from  to 
we cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage  the level of any self insurance retention applicable thereto  the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks  such as terrorism 
we may from time to time seek to retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on the prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases in which we determine that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over the revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as differing depreciation periods for our property and equipment and deferred revenue  for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets principally net operating loss carryforwards will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill through december   we had assessed the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we considered important which could have triggered an impairment review included the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
through that date  when we determined that the carrying value of long lived assets and related goodwill may not have been recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measured any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
long lived assets were  million including goodwill and other intangible assets of  million as of december  long lived assets included property and equipment  investment in the park partnerships and intangible assets 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  as of january   we ceased amortizing approximately billion of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of goodwill amortization including equity method goodwill  exclusive of tax effect on these amounts during and would have recorded a comparable amount of amortization during and had sfas no 
been in effect during  the net loss applicable to common stock for the year would have decreased to million or per basic share 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and are required to perform an annual impairment review thereafter 
to accomplish this  we identified our reporting units north america and europe and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  we then determined the fair value of each reporting unit  compared it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit and compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which were measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
based on the foregoing  we determined that million of goodwill associated with our european reporting unit was impaired and  during  we recognized a transitional impairment loss in that amount as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statements of operations 
the loss was retroactively recorded in the first quarter of  which was restated for this loss  in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
for we determined the fair value of our north american assets by using the discounted cash flow method  that is  we estimated cash flow applicable to our north american unit after deducting estimated capital expenditures  applied a multiple to such amount based on the multiple inherent in our stock price  and discounted the result by an amount equal to our cost of capital 
based on the foregoing  no impairment was required for our unamortized goodwill after impairment is  million at december  see note i to notes to consolidated financial statements 
market risks and sensitivity analyses like other global companies  we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the objective of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operations  cash flows and equity 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we are party to three interest rate swap agreements that for the term of the applicable agreements ranging from march to june effectively convert million of our million term loan into a fixed rate obligation 
our term loan borrowings bear interest at above the libor rate 
our interest rate swap agreements effectively lock in the libor component at rates ranging from to and average 
the counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions  which minimizes the credit risk 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis the following analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value  operations and cash flows of our market risk financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates as if these changes occurred at december  the range of changes chosen for this analysis reflect our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate assumptions 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of these changes in interest and exchange rates 
at december  and after giving effect to the million increase in our term loan and the redemption of the notes  each occurring in january  we had total debt of  million  of which  million represents fixed rate debt and the balance represents floating rate debt 
of the floating rate debt  million principal amount is subject to interest rate swap agreements 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact book value  operations or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future operations and cash flows  assuming other factors remain constant 
additionally  increases and decreases in interest rates impact the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
a decrease in thirty and ninety day libor interest rates increases the fair value liability of the interest rate swap agreements 
however  over the term of the interest rate swap agreements  the economic effect of changes in interest rates is fixed as we will pay a fixed amount and are not subject to changes in interest rates 
assuming other variables remain constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements and assuming an average annual balance on our working capital revolver  the pre tax operations and cash flows impact resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be less than million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the statement updated  clarified and simplified existing accounting pronouncements 
as it relates to us  the statement eliminated the extraordinary loss classification on early debt extinguishments 
instead  the premiums and other costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt are now reflected in pre tax results similar to other debt related expenses  such as interest expense and amortization of issuance costs 
the statement became effective on january  in our case 
upon adoption  we reclassified the losses incurred in prior periods million  with a related benefit of million in and million  with a related tax benefit of million in as pretax items 
the adoption of this statement did not modify or adjust net loss for any period and did not impact our compliance with various debt covenants 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
which was subsequently reissued in december as interpretation no 
revised fin 
fin requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if the company has a variable interest or combination of variable interests that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
a direct or indirect ability to make decisions that significantly affect the results of the activities of a variable interest entity is a strong indication that a company has one or both of the characteristics that would require consolidation of the variable interest entity 
fin also requires additional disclosures regarding variable interest entities 
we adopted fin during the fourth quarter of as a result  the results of six flags over georgia  six flags over texas  six flags marine world and six flags white water atlanta  which were previously accounted for by the equity method  are now reflected as consolidated subsidiaries 
the and consolidated financial statements have been restated to consolidate these entities in order to enhance the comparability to the presentation
