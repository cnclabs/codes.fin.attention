item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we begin our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a with a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements 
this is followed by a discussion of our results of operations that begins with an overview followed by a more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses 
we then provide an analysis of our liquidity and capital resources with a discussion of key aspects of our statements of cash flows  changes in our balance sheets  and our financial commitments 
following these discussions is the section entitled risks that could affect future results which details some important factors that may significantly impact our future financial performance 
you should also note that this md a discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see the section entitled caution regarding forward looking statements at the end of this item for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 
you should read this md a in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in item as discussed below  we sold our quicken loans mortgage business in fiscal and our japanese subsidiary  intuit kk  in fiscal and accounted for the sales of these businesses as discontinued operations 
accordingly  we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods prior to the sales to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations 
unless otherwise noted  the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this report with the audit committee of our board of directors 
net revenue revenue recognition 
intuit derives revenues from the sale of packaged software products  license fees  product support  professional services  outsourced payroll services  transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
see note to the financial statements  net revenue 
we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
net revenue return and rebate reserves 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates 
our return policy allows distributors and retailers  subject to certain contractual limitations  to return purchased products 
product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of obsolete products 
in determining our product returns reserves  we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel  historical return rates for prior releases of the product  trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products 
we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels 

table of contents our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates 
our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs  which we typically establish annually 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program  actual sales during the promotion  the amount of redemptions received and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 
in the past  actual returns and rebates have approximated and not generally exceeded the reserves that we have established 
however  actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if we were to change our assumptions and estimates  our revenue reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our future reported revenue 
for example  if we had increased our fiscal returns reserves by of non consignment sales to retailers for quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  our fiscal total net revenue would have been million lower 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 
if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve  this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income 
goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments 
we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 
we evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges  higher net income and higher asset values 
we recorded impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets of million in fiscal and million in fiscal at july   we had million in goodwill and million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet 
accounting for stock based incentive programs 
we currently measure compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  we do not record compensation expense when stock options are granted to eligible participants as long as the 
table of contents exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option is granted 
we also do not record compensation expense for shares purchased in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as long as the purchase price of the stock is not less than of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs 
we have elected to follow apb because the fair value accounting provided for under sfas requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
on march   the financial accounting standards board issued its exposure draft  share based payment  which is a proposed amendment to sfas the exposure draft would require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
the fasb expects to issue a final standard late in that would be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not yet assessed the impact of adopting this new standard 
we monitor progress at the fasb and other developments with respect to stock based incentive compensation 
we may have to recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods if we are required or elect to expense the value of stock based incentive compensation or if we decide to alter our current employee compensation programs to provide other benefits in place of incentive stock options 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we record an additional amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate tax assessment to be 
if in a later period we determine that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that later period 
as a result  our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 
this also requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense on our statement of operations 
our net deferred tax asset at july  was million  net of the valuation allowance of million 
we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of certain net operating losses carried forward by our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize 
an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact  which could be material  on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase 

table of contents results of operations overview fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in millions  except per change change share amounts total net revenue income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations diluted net income per share from continuing operations net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage our operations and view our results 
our five business segments are now quickbooks related  intuit branded small business  consumer tax  professional tax and other businesses 
total net revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to growth in our quickbooks related and consumer tax segments 
fiscal growth in our quickbooks related segment was driven by sales of higher priced versions of quickbooks and by continuing growth in the quickbooks do it yourself payroll  or diy  customer base and average selling prices  which resulted in higher diy revenue 
total net revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to growth in our quickbooks related and consumer tax segments  with the quickbooks related revenue increase fueled by sales of higher priced versions of quickbooks and by diy revenue 
fiscal revenue also increased compared with fiscal because of acquisitions in our intuit branded small business segment 
the markets for many of our products are maturing and as a result we believe that our revenue growth is slowing 
we continue to develop new products and services to mitigate the impact of this slowing growth in the long term 
income from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal primarily due to an increase in revenue from higher margin products  such as industry specific versions of quickbooks and diy  and to the fact that we reduced costs while revenue grew in our quicken business 
income from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal primarily due to an increase in revenue from higher margin products  efficiencies in customer service and technical support  significantly lower acquisition related charges in fiscal and fiscal charges for vacant facilities  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and impairment of long lived assets that did not recur in fiscal fiscal acquisition related charges were significantly lower compared with fiscal because due to our adoption of sfas fiscal acquisition related charges do not include amortization of goodwill 
net income after tax from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal primarily due to the factors cited above and the reversal of million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved  partially offset by lower interest and other income and lower gains on marketable securities and other investments 
net income after tax from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal primarily due to the factors cited above and to higher interest and other income and gains on marketable securities and other investments in fiscal  partially offset by a fiscal gain on divestiture of businesses that did not recur in fiscal and a higher effective tax rate in fiscal than in fiscal diluted net income per share from continuing operations grew faster than net income after tax from continuing operations for fiscal and primarily due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of stock under our stock repurchase programs 
at july   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled billion 
in fiscal we generated cash primarily from continuing operations and the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and we used cash primarily for our stock repurchase programs  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
in fiscal we bought million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs at an average price of for a total price of million 
we completed our third stock repurchase program in june and at july  authorized funds of million remained available under our fourth program 

table of contents total net revenue the table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are categorized by our five reportable business segments 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage our operations and view our results 
we combined our fiscal quickbooks segment with the businesses from our fiscal small business products and services segment that relate to and support quickbooks to form the fiscal segment called quickbooks related 
we also combined our outsourced payroll and information technology businesses with our fiscal vertical business management solutions segment to form the fiscal segment called intuit branded small business 
we made no changes to our consumer tax  professional tax and other businesses segments 
we have reclassified previously reported fiscal and segment results to be consistent with the fiscal presentation

in fiscal our intuit branded small business segment included revenue from the date of acquisition for three companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal and one company we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal total net revenue by business segment quickbooks related quickbooks related product revenue is derived primarily from quickbooks desktop software products  quickbooks do it yourself payroll  or diy  which offers payroll tax tables  forms and electronic tax payment and filing on a subscription basis to small businesses that prepare their own payrolls  and financial supplies such as paper checks  envelopes and invoices 
quickbooks related service revenue is derived primarily from quickbooks online edition  quickbooks support plans and merchant services 
other revenue for this segment consists primarily of royalties from small business online services 
fiscal compared with fiscal quickbooks related total net revenue grew in fiscal compared with fiscal due to increased sales of higher priced industry specific versions of quickbooks and higher diy revenue driven by growth in the average customer base  an increase in quickbooks related services and the full impact in fiscal of a december price increase 
our october acquisition of innovative merchant solutions also contributed to the higher fiscal total net revenue 
fiscal compared with fiscal quickbooks related total net revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal  reflecting higher quickbooks unit sales as well as higher average selling prices driven by the introduction of certain higher priced quickbooks products and a shift in revenue mix toward those products 
diy revenue increased due to growth in the average customer base and higher average selling prices driven by price increases 
quickbooks support revenue grew due to an increase in the number of support plans sold and strength in the higher priced support plans for higher end quickbooks products 
intuit branded small business intuit branded small business product revenue is derived primarily from business management software for information technology and four selected industries wholesale durable goods  residential  commercial and corporate property management  construction  and nonprofit organizations  universities and government agencies

table of contents consumer tax consumer tax product revenue is derived primarily from turbotax federal and state consumer desktop tax return preparation software 
consumer tax service revenue is derived primarily from turbotax for the web online tax return preparation services and consumer electronic filing services 
fiscal compared with fiscal consumer tax total net revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal as a result of turbotax for the web and retail desktop unit growth  higher attach rates for electronic filing services and higher average selling prices 
fiscal compared with fiscal consumer tax total net revenue grew in fiscal compared with fiscal due to an increase in desktop revenue that was driven by unit growth and higher average selling prices for federal tax offerings with enhanced functionality  higher turbotax for the web revenue due to unit growth and higher average selling prices  and an increase in electronic filing revenue due to higher federal desktop unit sales and higher average state electronic filing prices 
professional tax professional tax product revenue is derived primarily from proseries and lacerte professional tax preparation software products 
professional tax service revenue consists of electronic filing and training services 
fiscal compared with fiscal professional tax total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal compared with fiscal due to additional sales to existing customers  higher average selling prices related to product enhancements and increased sales of our unlimited electronic filing product as a result of new government rules requiring the electronic filing of certain professionally prepared income tax returns 
however  revenue growth in fiscal was negatively impacted by competition from lower priced professional tax preparation software products 
although we have revised our product strategy to address this competition for the tax year  it is possible that this competition may continue to negatively affect revenue growth rates for our professional tax segment in the future 
fiscal compared with fiscal professional tax total net revenue grew in fiscal compared with fiscal due to price increases related to product enhancements  new customer acquisition initiatives and successful cross sell efforts to the existing tax client base 
renewal rates for our existing customer base remained strong during fiscal other businesses other businesses consist primarily of quicken and canada

service revenue in canada consists primarily of revenue from software maintenance contracts sold with quickbooks 
fiscal compared with fiscal other businesses total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to higher quicken revenue 
in fiscal quicken direct unit sales increased in response to direct mail campaigns for upgrades due to the discontinuation of support for older versions of the product and for turbotax cross selling offers 
retail unit sales also increased 
aggregate average selling prices for quicken were higher in fiscal compared with fiscal due to a shift in demand to our higher priced quicken premier and quicken home and business products 
partially offsetting these increases  quicken other revenue declined in fiscal due to the expiration or termination of contracts with several significant online advertising customers 
we exited the online advertising business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents canadian revenue in us dollars was slightly higher in fiscal compared with fiscal due to the favorable effect of the strengthening canadian dollar in fiscal total net revenue in canadian dollars decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to lower demand for quickbooks in canada

fiscal compared with fiscal other businesses total net revenue increased slightly in fiscal compared with fiscal quicken revenue decreased while canadian revenue grew 
quicken product revenue decreased due to lack of growth in the market for personal finance desktop software and slow consumer spending 
lower unit sales for all quicken products more than offset higher average selling prices for quicken premier and quicken home and business 
quicken other revenue also decreased due to continuing slowness in internet advertising and our exit from certain online businesses in fiscal total net revenue from canada grew in fiscal compared with fiscal  due partially to slightly higher revenue from quicktax 
higher average selling prices and higher unit sales for this product were fueled by the introduction of right for me consumer tax products targeted at taxpayers who maintain home offices or who are preparing for retirement

cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal this decrease was due to growth in our consumer tax service revenue  which had minimal incremental costs 
cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue also decreased in fiscal due to growth in revenue from the higher margin businesses we acquired during fiscal and  notably intuit information technology solutions and innovative merchant solutions

these factors were partially offset by increases in spending for product development  marketing  sales and technical support for industry specific versions of quickbooks that launched late in fiscal and throughout fiscal intuit branded small business fiscal compared with fiscal our intuit branded small business segment had operating income in fiscal after it broke even in fiscal because revenue for this segment grew while we held costs steady in our information technology and industry solutions businesses 
partially offsetting these improvements  outsourced payroll operating income was lower in fiscal because we incurred expenses for additional sales and service personnel during the first half of the year that were not completely offset by increased revenue 
fiscal compared with fiscal intuit branded small business broke even in fiscal after experiencing an operating loss in fiscal the primary reasons for the improvement in operating margin were growth in our outsourced payroll business and our acquisition of intuit information technology solutions in the first quarter of fiscal consumer tax fiscal compared with fiscal consumer tax segment operating income growth in fiscal was slightly above revenue growth for that period because gross margin improvements due to higher average selling prices and growing high margin service revenues were only partially offset by additional costs incurred for national television and radio advertising in fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal consumer tax segment operating income growth in fiscal was above revenue growth for that period as improvements in average selling prices were partially offset by additional costs incurred for higher partner royalties and infrastructure

our effective tax rate for fiscal differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the benefit received from tax exempt interest income and various tax credits offset by state taxes and acquisition related charges 
our effective tax rate for fiscal differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to a tax benefit related to a divestiture that became available during the year and to tax exempt interest income offset by non deductible merger related charges 
see note to the financial statements 
at july   we had net deferred tax assets of million  which included a valuation allowance of million for net operating loss carryforwards relating to our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards 
the allowance reflects management s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards of our international subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions 
while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient  it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets 
we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis

table of contents risks that could affect future results we face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses that may negatively impact our revenue  profitability and market position 
we have formidable competitors and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal and beyond 
the number  resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete has increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings 
microsoft corporation  in particular  presents a significant threat to a number of our businesses due to its market position  strategic focus and superior financial resources 
our competitors may introduce new and improved products and services  bundle new offerings with market leading products  reduce prices  gain better access to distribution channels  advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services 
any of these competitive actions particularly any prolonged price competition could diminish our revenue and profitability and could affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers 
some additional competitive factors that may impact our businesses are as follows quickbooks related 
losing existing or potential quickbooks customers to competitors causes us to lose potential software revenue and limits our opportunities to sell related products and services such as our financial supplies  diy payroll and merchant service offerings 
many competitors and potential competitors provide  or have expressed significant interest in providing  accounting and business management products and services to small businesses 
for example  microsoft currently offers a number of competitive small business offerings and has indicated part of its growth strategy is to focus on small business offerings 
accordingly  we expect that competition from microsoft in the small business area will intensify over time with the introduction of small business offerings that directly compete with our quickbooks and other offerings 
given its market position and resources  if microsoft launches additional products and services that directly compete with our offerings it may have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability 
consumer tax 
our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and private sector 
in the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers 
federal government 
agencies of the us government have made several attempts during the two most recent presidential administrations to offer taxpayers a form of free tax preparation software and filing service 
however  in october the us internal revenue service agreed not to develop or deploy its own competing tax software product or service so long as participants in an association of private tax preparation software companies  including intuit  agreed to provide web based federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to qualified taxpayers for a period of three years  subject to recurring two year extensions 
the relationship  called the free file alliance  is intended to serve lower income  disadvantaged and underserved taxpayers with the objective of making free online tax preparation software and filing services available to at least of taxpayers 
although the free file alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to our tax offerings  it has caused us to lose revenue opportunities for a large percentage of the tax base 
in addition  some of our competitors are using the free file alliance as a free marketing tool by giving away services at the federal level and attempting to make money from ancillary service offerings 
further  were the federal government to terminate the free file alliance and elect to provide its own software and electronic filing services available to taxpayers at no charge it would negatively impact our revenue and profits 
state governments 
state taxing authorities have also actively pursued strategies to provide free online tax return preparation and electronic filing services for state taxpayers 
during at least states participated in free file alliance collaborations with private sector software companies to offer free online tax preparation and electronic filing services to qualified taxpayers 
however  states  including california  directly offered their own online services to taxpayers 
it is possible that other governmental entities that currently do not offer such services will elect to pursue similar competitive offerings in the future 
these publicly sponsored programs have caused us to lose potential customers to free offerings and have enabled competitors to gain market share at our expense by using participation in the free alliances as an effective tool to attract customers to ancillary paid offerings 
given the efficiencies that electronic tax filing provides to taxing authorities  we anticipate that governmental competition will present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future 

table of contents private sector 
in the private sector we face intense competition primarily from h r block  the makers of taxcut software  and from web based competitive offerings 
we also compete for customers with low cost assisted tax preparation businesses  such as h r block 
other segments intuit branded small business  professional tax and other businesses 
our professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers to competitors offering no frills offerings at low prices 
this business also faces competition from competitively priced integrated accounting solutions that are more complete than our current offerings 
the substantial size of our principal competitors in the outsourced payroll services business and our merchant card processing service business benefit from greater economies of scale that may result in pricing pressure for our offerings 
the growth of electronic banking and other electronic payment systems is decreasing the demand for checks and consequently causing pricing pressure for our supplies products as competitors aggressively compete for share of this shrinking market 
our quicken products compete both with microsoft money  which is aggressively promoted and priced  and with web based electronic banking and personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers 
these competitive pressures may result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our quicken product line and related bill payment service offering 
the growth of some of our businesses is slowing and if we do not continue to introduce new and enhanced products and services our revenues and margins will decline 
we are seeing a slowdown in the revenue growth rate for some of our businesses as they mature 
this trend causes our product development efforts to be even more critical to our success 
product and service enhancements are necessary for us to differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors and to motivate our existing customers to purchase upgrades  or annual licenses in the case of our tax offerings 
a number of our businesses derive a significant amount of their revenue through one time upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings that include upgrades to generate a significant portion of their revenues 
as our existing products mature  encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value 
if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of upgraded products to our customers  our upgrade and service revenues will be negatively impacted 
similarly  our business will be harmed if we are not successful in our efforts to develop and introduce new products and services that expand our customer base and revenues per customer 
we are implementing new information systems and problems with the design or implementation of these systems could interfere with our business and operations 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems to replace existing systems that manage our business and finance operations 
due to the size and complexity of our portfolio of businesses  the conversion process is very challenging 
we began switching over in large part to the new information systems in september with the upgrade of significant financial systems  order taking systems  middleware systems systems to allow for interoperability of different databases and network security systems 
although the upgraded systems appear to be functioning in a stable manner and performing tasks at acceptable performance levels for our current business demands  we may still encounter difficulties as our business demands increase and as greater functionality from the systems is required 
for example  we have not yet successfully closed a financial reporting period with data generated by the upgraded systems 
similarly  the upgraded systems have not yet been subject to  and may not be able to handle  the demand peaks caused by the seasonal nature of our business 
in addition  although the switch over of our more critical systems is underway  we will be continuing to replace existing systems throughout fiscal year any disruptions relating to our systems enhancements  particularly any disruptions impacting our operations during our second and third fiscal quarters  could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely and accurate manner take customer orders  ship products  provide services and support to our customers  bill and track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business 
even if we do succeed  the implementation may be much more costly than we anticipated 
if we are unable to successfully implement new information systems as planned  in addition to adversely impacting our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows in the short and long term  it could also affect our ability to collect the information necessary to timely file our first quarter fiscal financial reports with the sec 

table of contents our new product and service offerings may not achieve market success or may cannibalize sales of our existing products  causing our revenues and earnings to decrease 
our future success depends in large part upon our ability to identify emerging opportunities in our target markets and our capacity to quickly develop  and sell products and services that satisfy these demands in a cost effective manner 
successfully predicting demand trends is difficult and we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products or services that do not succeed in their markets 
we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past 
for example  in we ended our quicken brokerage service offering due to lack of customer acceptance 
if we misjudge customer needs  our new products and services will not succeed and our revenues and earnings will be negatively impacted 
in addition  as we expand our offerings to new customer categories we run the risk of customers shifting from higher priced and higher margin products to newly introduced lower priced offerings 
if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it will harm our revenues  operating income and reputation 
all of our tax products  and many of our non tax products  have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays 
many of our products are highly complex and require interoperability with other software products and services 
our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by april th 
due to this complexity and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software 
for example  our software may face interoperability difficulties with software operating systems or programs being used by our customers 
when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code  distribute patches to customers that had already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels 
if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date 
any major defects or launch delays could lead to the following loss of customers to competitors  which could also deprive us of future revenue attributable to repeat purchases  product upgrades and purchases of related services  negative publicity and damage to our brands  customer dissatisfaction  reduced retailer shelf space and product promotions  and increased operating expenses  such as inventory replacement costs and in our consumer tax business  expenses resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 
if we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings  or if the irs or other governmental agencies experience difficulties in receiving customer submissions  we could lose revenue and customers 
our web based tax preparation and electronic filing services must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season 
we face significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate service levels  particularly during peak volume service times 
similarly  governmental entities receiving electronic tax filings must also handle large volumes of data and may experience difficulties with their systems preventing the receipt of electronic filings 
if customers are unable to file their returns electronically they may elect to make paper filings 
this would result in reduced electronic tax return preparation and filing revenues and profits and would negatively impact our reputation and ability to keep and attract customers who demand a reliable electronic filing experience 
we have experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filing and or tax preparation services during past tax years 
for example  on april  we experienced a relatively brief unscheduled interruption in our electronic filing service during which certain users of our professional tax products were unable to receive confirmation from us that their electronic filing had been accepted and on april  we reached maximum capacity for processing e filings for short period of time 
if we experience any prolonged difficulties with our web based tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season  we could lose current and future customers  receive negative publicity and incur increased 
table of contents operating costs  any of which could have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of these businesses and have a negative impact on our near term and long term financial results 
our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 
several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results 
revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january and april due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software upgrades 
we experience lower revenues  and significant operating losses  in the first and fourth quarters ending october and july our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors  including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices  product release dates  the timing of our discontinuance of support for older product offerings  the timing of sales of our higher priced intuit branded small business offerings  our methods for distributing our products  including the shift to a consignment model for some of our desktop products sold through retail distribution channels  and the timing of acquisitions  divestitures  and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges 
as our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams become less predictable 
our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses 
the accounting policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services 
we expect this trend to continue as we acquire additional companies and expand our offerings 
for example  as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of multiple element sales arrangements  we could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products 
this would decrease recognized revenue at the time products are shipped  but result in increased recognized revenue in fiscal periods after shipment 
for example  some of our turbotax offerings provide for both use of our software and filing of returns electronically  causing some of our revenue to be deferred until the time of the actual filing of tax returns by our customers 
in addition  our intuit branded small business segment businesses offer products and services with significantly higher prices than we have traditionally offered 
revenue from these offerings tends to be less predictable than revenue from our traditional desktop products  due to longer sales and implementation cycles 
these businesses also tend to rely on a relatively small number of large orders for a substantial portion of their revenue in a particular quarter  which could cause our quarterly revenue from these businesses to fluctuate 
acquisition related costs and impairment charges can cause significant fluctuation in our net income 
our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses  including amortization of purchased software which is reflected in cost of revenue  as well as charges for in process research and development  and amortization and impairment of goodwill  purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation which are reflected in operating expenses 
total acquisition related costs in the categories identified above were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal and acquisition related costs have declined primarily because of a change in the accounting treatment of goodwill 
however  we may incur less frequent  but larger  impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions 
we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
for example  at the end of fiscal we incurred an impairment charge of million related to our acquisition of intuit public sector solutions 
as of july   we had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately million  which could be subject to impairment charges in the future 
new acquisitions  and any impairment of the value of purchased assets  could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 
if we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer service and technical support inquiries we will lose customers and our revenues will decline 
the effectiveness of our customer service and technical support operations are critical to customer satisfaction and our financial success 
if we do not respond effectively to service and technical support requests we will lose customers and miss out on potential revenue opportunities  such as paid service and new product sales 
in our 
table of contents service offerings  such as our merchant card processing and outsourced payroll businesses  customer service delivery is fundamental to retaining and maintaining existing customer and acquiring new customers 
we occasionally experience customer service and technical support problems  including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a higher than anticipated volume of requests 
we also risk losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup support 
training and retaining qualified customer service and technical support personnel is particularly challenging due to the expansion of our product offerings and the seasonality of our tax business 
for example  in fiscal the number of our consumer tax service representatives ranged from during off season months to about at the peak of the season 
if we do not adequately train our support representatives our customers will not receive the level of support that they demand and we strive to deliver 
to improve our performance in this area  we must eliminate underlying causes of service and support requests through product improvements  better order fulfillment processes  more robust self help tools  and improved ability to accurately anticipate demand for support 
implementing any of these improvements can be expensive  time consuming and ultimately prove unsuccessful 
if we do not deliver the high level of support that our customers expect for any of the reasons stated above we will lose customers and our financial results will suffer 
if we encounter problems with our third party customer service and technical support providers our business will be harmed and margins will decline 
we outsource a substantial portion of our customer support activities to third party service providers  most significantly to service providers in india 
during fiscal we greatly increased the number of third party customer service representatives working on our behalf and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future 
this strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility  but also presents risks to our business  including the following international outsourcing has received considerable negative attention in the media and there are indications that the us congress may pass legislation that would impact how we operate and impact customer perceptions of our service 
for example  in congress legislators have discussed restricting the flow of personal information to overseas providers and requiring representatives in foreign jurisdictions to affirmatively identify themselves by name and location  customers may react negatively to providing information to and receiving support from overseas organizations  we may not be able to impact the quality of support that we provide as directly as we are able to in our company run call centers  in recent years india has experienced political instability and changing policies that may impact our operations 
in addition  for a number of years india and pakistan have been in conflict and an active state of war between the two countries could disrupt our services  and we rely on a global communications infrastructure that may be interrupted in a number of ways 
for example  in fiscal we had to reroute calls to india due to an underwater cable being cut in the mediterranean sea 
we face significant risks in our retail distribution channel that could result in loss of revenues and reduced margins 
we sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a relatively small number of retailers generate much of our sales volume 
our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and available resources 
any change in principal business terms  termination or major disruption of our relationship with these resellers could result in a potentially significant decline in our revenues and earnings 
for example  the sourcing decisions  product display locations and promotional activities that retailers undertake can greatly impact the sales of our products 
due to its seasonal nature  sales of turbotax are particularly impacted by such decisions and if our principal distribution sources were to elect to carry or promote competitive products our revenues would decline 
the fact that we also sell our products directly could cause retailers to reduce their efforts to promote our products or stop selling our products altogether 
if any of our retailers run into financial difficulties we may be unable to collect amounts that we are owed 

table of contents selling new products may be more challenging and costlier than selling our historical products  causing our margins to decline 
because our strategy for some of our products involves the routine introduction of new products at retail  if retailers do not offer our new products we will not be able to grow as planned 
an outcome of our right for me marketing approach is the introduction of additional versions of our products 
retailers may be reluctant to stock unproven products  or products that sell at higher prices  but more slowly 
retailers may also choose to place less emphasis on software as a category within their stores 
in addition  it may be costlier for us to market and sell some of our higher priced products due to our need to convey the more customer specific value of the products to customers rather than communicating more generalized benefits 
this may require us to develop other marketing programs that supplement our traditional in store promotional efforts to sell these products to customers causing our margins to shrink 
if retail distribution proves an ineffective channel for certain of our new offerings it could adversely impact our growth  revenue and profitability 
if our manufacturing and distribution suppliers execute poorly our business will be harmed 
we have chosen to outsource the manufacturing and distribution of many of our desktop software products to a small number of third party providers and we use a single vendor to produce and distribute our check and business forms supplies products 
although our reliance on a small number of suppliers  or a single supplier  provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power  poor performance by or lack of effective communication with these parties can significantly harm our business 
this risk is amplified by the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on just in time manufacturing processes 
we have experienced problems with our suppliers in the past 
for example  during fiscal one of our suppliers was unable to fulfill orders for some of our software products for a number of days due to operational difficulties and communication errors 
although together we were able to mitigate the impact of that delay with minimal disruption to our business  if we experience longer delays  delays during a peak demand period or significant quality issues our business will be significantly harmed 
failure of our information technology systems or those of our service providers could adversely affect our future operating results 
we rely on a variety of internal technology systems and technology systems maintained by our outside manufacturing and distribution suppliers to take and fulfill customer orders  handle customer service requests  host our web based activities  support internal operations  and store customer and company data 
these systems could be damaged or interrupted  preventing us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or otherwise interrupting our business 
in addition  these systems could suffer security breaches  causing company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed 
any of these occurrences could adversely impact our operations 
we have experienced system challenges in the past 
for example  during fiscal some of our non critical systems were interrupted due to computer viruses that caused loss of productivity and added expense 
we also experience computer server failures from time to time 
to prevent interruptions we must continually upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we have adequate recoverability both of which are costly and time consuming 
while we and our outside service partners have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations  not all systems upon which we rely are fully redundant and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 
possession and use of personal customer information by our businesses presents risks and expenses that could harm our business 
a number of our businesses possess personal customer information 
possession and use of this information in conducting our business subjects us to regulatory burdens and potential lawsuits 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols and there is a trend toward greater regulation of privacy 
for example  regulations like the recently created federal do not call list  and actions by internet service providers to limit communications with their subscribers may impede our ability to communicate with our customers and increase our compliance costs 
because our businesses rely heavily on direct marketing  any limitations on our ability to communicate with our customers could harm our financial results 
in the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we could face similar suits in the future 
a major breach of customer privacy or security by intuit  or even another company  could have serious negative consequences for our businesses  including direct damages that we may be 
table of contents required to pay as a result of a breach by us  reduced customer demand for our services and additional regulation by federal or state agencies 
although we have sophisticated network security  internal control measures  and physical security procedures to safeguard customer information  there can be no assurance that a data security breach or theft will not occur resulting in harm to our business and results of operations 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may exploit our innovations  which could weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret  trademark  patent  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  contractors  distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
effectively creating and protecting our proprietary rights is expensive and may require us to engage in expensive and distracting litigation 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization 
because we outsource significant aspects of our product development  manufacturing and distribution we are at risk that confidential portions of our intellectual property could become public by lapses in security by our contractors 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to others 
these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation 
it is also possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patent portfolio  which is relatively small  may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage 
ultimately  our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technologies  duplicate our products  or design around patents and other intellectual property rights 
if our intellectual property protection proves inadequate we could lose our competitive advantage and our financial results will suffer 
we expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem causing lost revenue and increased expenses 
our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets 
policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult  expensive  and time consuming 
current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection 
we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
for example  we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online auction sites and other online marketplaces 
in addition  efforts to protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our customers 
for example  during we employed technology to prohibit unauthorized sharing of our turbotax products 
these efforts were not effectively communicated causing a negative reaction by some of our customers who misunderstood our actions 
although we continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy  and we continue to increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts  we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 
we do not own all of the software  other technologies and content used in our products and services 
many of our products are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties 
we believe we have all of the necessary licenses from third parties to use and distribute third party technology and content that we do not own that is used in our current products and services 
from time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties or negotiate with new third parties to include their technology or content in our existing products  in new versions of our existing products or in wholly new products 
we may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use third party technology or content in our products and services  we may not be able to sell the affected products  which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 
we may unintentionally infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our business operations 
as the number of our products and services increases and their features and content continue to expand  and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses  we may increasingly become subject to infringement claims by third parties 
we expect that software products in general will increasingly be subject to these claims as the number 
table of contents of products and competitors increase  the functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality continues to grow 
from time to time  we have received communications from third parties in which the claimant alleges that a product or service we offer infringes the claimant s intellectual property rights 
occasionally these communications result in lawsuits 
in many of these cases  it is difficult to assess the extent to which the intellectual property right that the claimant asserts is valid or the extent to which we have any material exposure 
the receipt of a notice alleging infringement may require us to obtain a costly opinion of counsel to prevent an allegation of intentional infringement 
future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude 
existing or future infringement claims or lawsuits against us  whether valid or not  may be time consuming and expensive to defend and be distracting to our developers and management 
intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property  which may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all  or redesign our software products or services  possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal 
any of these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results 
our acquisition activity could disrupt our ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 
we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies  products and technologies that complement our strategic direction 
for example  over the last three fiscal years we have acquired the stock or assets of eight companies 
these acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties  including inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies  and procedures  distraction of management s attention away from normal business operations  challenges retaining the key employees of the acquired operation  insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed  expenses associated with the acquisition  and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process  including product quality issues and legal contingencies 
acquisitions are inherently risky  we can not be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct  operating results or financial condition of our business 
we have generally paid cash for our recent acquisitions 
if we issue common stock or other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition  current shareholders percentage ownership and earnings per share may become diluted 
if we fail to operate our outsourced payroll business effectively our revenue and profitability will be harmed 
our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and transaction volume 
due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately 
despite our efforts  it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated 
in addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems would create  which could be substantial  the loss of customer confidence in our accuracy and controls would seriously harm our business 
our payroll business has grown largely through acquisitions and our systems are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale 
we must constantly continue to upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we process customer data in an accurate  reliable and timely manner 
these upgrades must also meet the various regulatory deadlines associated with employer related payroll activities 
any failure of our systems or processes in critical switch over times  such as in january when many businesses elect to change payroll service providers  would be detrimental to our business 
if we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products  it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor s product for that year s payroll and not to purchase intuit products in the future 
to generate sustained growth in our payroll business we must successfully develop and manage a more proactive inside and field sales operation 
if these efforts are not successful our revenue growth and profitability will decline 

table of contents interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits may fluctuate or be eliminated causing our revenue and profitability to decline 
we currently earn revenue from interest earned on customer deposits that we hold pending payment of funds to taxing authorities or to customers employees 
if interest rates decline  or there are regulatory changes that diminish the amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such funds our interest revenue will decline 
we face a number of risks in our merchant card processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenues and profits 
our merchant card processing service business is subject to the following risks if merchants for whom we process credit card transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments  we will not be able to conduct our business if the bank sponsors and card payment processors and other service providers that we rely on to process bankcard transactions terminate their relationships with us and we are not able to secure or successfully migrate our business elsewhere  we could be required to stop providing payment processing services for visa and mastercard if we or our bank sponsors fail to adhere to the standards of the visa and mastercard credit card associations  we depend on independent sales organizations that do not serve us exclusively to acquire and retain merchant accounts  our profit margins will be reduced if for competitive reasons we cannot increase our fees at times when visa and mastercard increase the fees that we pay to process merchant transactions through their systems  unauthorized disclosure of merchant and cardholder data  whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise  could expose us to protracted and costly litigation  and we may encounter difficulties scaling our business systems to support our growth as we continue to migrate users of our quickbooks merchant account services from third party service providers to our own systems 
should any of these risks be realized our business could be harmed and our financial results will suffer 
increased state filing mandates could significantly increase our costs 
we are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services 
changes in state imposed requirements by one or more of the states  including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards  could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and could prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 
we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 
much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel  including members of our executive team  and those in technical  marketing and staff positions 
experienced personnel in the software and services industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  especially in the silicon valley and san diego  california  where the majority of our employees are located 
although we strive to be an employer of choice  we may not be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause our business to suffer 
if actual product returns exceed returns reserves  or if customer rebates exceed historical amounts  our revenue would be lower 
we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell  in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products 
this is particularly true for our consumer tax products  which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fourth fiscal quarter 
like 
table of contents most software companies  we have historically accepted significant product returns 
we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements  based on estimated future returns of products 
we closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns 
in the past  returns have not generally exceeded these reserves 
however  if we do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves  it would result in lower net revenue 
in addition  our policy of recognizing revenue from distributors and retailers upon delivery of product for non consignment sales is predicated upon our ability to reasonably estimate returns 
if we do not continue to demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue recognition policy for these types of sales may no longer be appropriate 
we also offer customer rebates as part of our selling efforts and establish reserves for payment of rebates 
historically a percentage of customers do not submit requests for their rebates 
if a greater number of eligible customers seek rebates than for which we have provided reserves  our margins will be adversely affected 
for example  if rebate redemptions for our quickbooks  turbotax and quicken products were to increase by  it would result in a decrease of approximately million in our revenue 
our insurance policies are costly  may be inadequate and potentially expose us to unrecoverable risks 
insurance availability  coverage terms and pricing continue to vary with market conditions 
we endeavor to obtain appropriate insurance coverage for insurable risks that we identify  however  we may fail to correctly anticipate or quantify insurable risks  we may not be able to obtain appropriate insurance coverage  and insurers may not respond as we intend to cover insurable events that may occur 
we have observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance 
such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs  higher policy deductibles  and lower coverage limits 
for some risks  because of cost or availability  the company does not have insurance coverage 
for these reasons  the company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost 
if we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense  it would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share 
although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants to employees that have an exercise price at or above fair market value  it is possible that future accounting pronouncements will require us to treat all employee stock options as a compensation expense 
the increased compensation expense would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles 
we are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and is a distraction to our business 
due to our financial position and the large number of customers that we serve we are often forced to defend litigation 
for example we are currently being sued in three actions for claims related to our election to stop supporting certain of our older product offerings 
although we believe that these cases have no merit and we are defending the matters vigorously  defending such matters is distracting to management and expensive for intuit 
although we often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs  there is no assurance that our defense costs  which can be substantial  will be covered in all cases 
in addition  by its nature  litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases where we strongly believe a plaintiff s case has no valid claims 
if we do not prevail in litigation we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations 
regardless of the outcome  litigation is expensive and distracting and may reduce our income 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 
our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our stock price may be volatile 
our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of our announcements and those of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our stock in the future 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately  which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to detect and prevent fraud 
we periodically assess our system of internal controls  and the internal controls of service providers upon which we rely  to review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of improvement 
these assessments may conclude that enhancements  modifications or changes to our system of internal controls are necessary 
in addition  from time to time we acquire businesses  many of which have limited infrastructure and systems of internal controls 
performing assessments of internal controls  implementing necessary changes  and maintaining an effective internal controls process is expensive and requires considerable management attention  particularly in the case of newly acquired entities 
internal control systems are designed in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and all such systems  however well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  and not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the system are met 
because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems  there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  regardless of how remote 
if we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls or prevent fraud  we could suffer losses  could be subject to costly litigation  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our brand and operating results could be harmed  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
we must comply with recently enacted legislation known as sox specifically  we and our independent registered public accounting firm must certify the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting at july  identification of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting by us or our independent registered public accounting firm could adversely affect our competitive position in our business  especially our outsourced payroll business  and the market price for our common stock 
business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results 
several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake  fire  power shortages  terrorist attacks and other hostile acts  and other events beyond our control 
the majority of our research and development activities  our corporate headquarters  our principal information technology systems  and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults 
we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake related losses 
our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster

we caution investors that forward looking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance 
our actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements due to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of short term investments and funds held for payroll customers 
our short term investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy 
this policy specifies that  except for direct obligations of the united states government  securities issued by agencies of the united states government  and money market or cash management funds  we diversify our holdings by limiting our short term investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer 
the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments at july  by stated maturity 
the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and short term investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet 
as of july  the interest rate earned on our money market accounts is and the interest rate earned on our short term investments is 
years ending july  and thereafter total in thousands cash equivalents short term investments interest rate risk our cash equivalents and our portfolio of short term investments and funds held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents  short term investments and funds held for payroll customers and the value of those investments 
should interest rates increase by from the levels of july   the value of our short term investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately million 
should interest rates increase by basis points from the levels of july   the value of our short term investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately million 
impact of foreign currency rate changes since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars and british pounds into u 
s dollars for financial reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results 
the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies 
there was a nominal currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions for fiscal due primarily to the effect of the weakening us dollar on intercompany balances with our canadian subsidiary  we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of million in fiscal and million in fiscal although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future  there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future 
as of july   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
