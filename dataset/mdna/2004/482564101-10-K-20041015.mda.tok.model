item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we anticipate that the regulation of our business operations under federal  state and local environmental regulations in the united states and abroad will increase over time 
we cannot estimate the impact of increased regulation on our operations  future capital expenditure requirements or the cost of compliance 
united states regulation 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  also known as the superfund law  and comparable state laws generally impose joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under cercla as hazardous substances 
in the course of our operations  we may have generated and may generate wastes that fall within cercla s definition of hazardous substances 
we may be the owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released  and may have generated wastes that have been transported to offsite facilities 
we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities at which such substances have been released by previous owners or operators and offsite facilities to which our wastes were transported 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  and comparable state laws  regulate the treatment  storage  disposal and transportation of wastes including those designated as hazardous wastes under rcra 
the epa and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for these wastes 
it is possible that our operations may generate wastes that are subject to rcra and comparable state statutes 
furthermore  wastes generated by our operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes and  therefore  may be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined 
the cwa  and comparable state laws  provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of hazardous substances and of other pollutants 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health  principally the occupational safety and health act osha and its regulations 
the osha hazard communication standard  the epa community right to know regulations and similar state programs may require us to organize and or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements 
mexico regulation 
our matamoros facility and its operations in mexico are subject to various environmental laws  regulations and ordinances promulgated by governmental authorities in mexico 
the ministry of the environment and natural resources secretariate de medio ambiente y recursos naturales semarnat is given overall responsibility for environmental regulation in mexico 
semarnat s responsibilities include enforcement of mexico s laws and regulations concerning air and water emissions and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal 
semarnat is given broad authority to enforce compliance with environmental laws and regulations and can require that operations be suspended pending completion of required remedial action 
licenses  permits and product registrations 
certain licenses  permits and product registrations are required for our products and operations in the united states  mexico and other countries in which we do business 
the licenses  permits and product registrations are subject to revocation  modification and renewal by governmental authorities 
in the united states in particular  producers and distributors of chemicals such as penta  creosote  tetrachlorvinphos and msma are subject to registration and notification requirements under federal law including under the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra and the toxic substances control act  and comparable state law in order to sell those products in the united states 
compliance with these requirements has had  and in the future will continue to have  a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under fifra  the registration system requires an ongoing submission to epa of substantial scientific research and testing data regarding the chemistry and toxicology of pesticide products by manufacturers 
under agreements with other industry participants  we share most research and testing costs pertaining to our chemical products 
we incurred expenses of approximately thousand in fiscal  thousand in  and thousand in in connection with the research  testing and other expenses in connection with our participation in several industry task forces

one bulk storage terminal is on the mississippi river in avondale  louisiana  and is used primarily for creosote imported by us from europe 
the second bulk facility is in south texas  and is used for creosote imported from mexico 
if either tank storage agreement was not renewed or was terminated  we believe that other suitable facilities could be obtained 
item legal proceedings we are not a party to any material legal actions or proceedings  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business  and we do not believe any such actions or proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial position

the future payment of dividends  however  will be within the discretion of the board of directors and depends on our profitability  capital requirements  financial condition  growth  business opportunities and other factors which our board of directors may deem relevant 
we did not repurchase any of our shares in fiscal on november   options to purchase  shares of our common stock were granted to non employee directors at an exercise price of per share 
the options were vested when granted and may be exercised for ten years until november  the issuance of the options was exempt pursuant to section of the securities act of on march   an option to purchase  shares of our common stock was granted to our chief operating officer at an exercise price of per share 
the option to purchase shares vests for of the total shares each year on the anniversary of the date of grant 
the option may be exercised for vested shares for ten years from vesting 
the issuance of the option was exempt pursuant to section of the securities act of in december  we purchased certain penta distribution assets of wood protection products  inc in connection with our acquisition of these assets  on december   we issued to an affiliate of wood protection products  an option to acquire  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share

the comparability of the data is affected by our acquisitions in fiscal  and  and by the adoption of sfas in fiscal see  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
the following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
years ended july  amounts in thousands except per share data income statement data net sales operating income income before tax net income net income per basic share outstanding diluted share outstanding cash dividends declared per share balance sheet data total assets long term obligations  less current portion item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation acquisitions in fiscal  we made three acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately million 
in december  we purchased certain penta distribution assets of wood protection products  inc as part of the purchase  we also granted an option to acquire  shares of our common stock  exercisable at per share 
the acquisition included distribution and plant equipment  inventory  penta product registrations and a consulting and non compete agreement with the seller s principal shareholder 
we believe that the penta purchase will add approximately million in annualized revenues 
the cash purchase price was primarily financed with a million term loan from southtrust bank 
see notes and to the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
in june  we purchased creosote product registrations from trenton sales  inc in connection with our purchase  we entered into a long term supply agreement with lufkin creosoting co  an affiliate of the seller  by which we will sell lufkin creosoting its creosote requirements for its wood treating operations 
we also obtained the seller s long term creosote supply agreement with a mexican producer of creosote 
we believe that the purchase will add almost million in annualized revenues in the first year 
although we had been purchasing creosote from the mexican creosote producer prior to the acquisition  the acquisition will increase our purchases of that lower cost creosote supply 
we also purchased the ravap tradename and inventory from boehringer ingelheim vetmedica  inc in june that tradename is for a product that contains rabon  the animal health product registration line we acquired for million in fiscal from boehringer 
this acquisition extends our available rabon product category  and we believe it will add approximately million in annualized animal health product sales 
the creosote distribution and ravap acquisitions were completed using available cash  borrowings under our revolving loan with southtrust bank  and by increasing one of our senior term loans with that bank by million 
results of operations sales revenue and gross profit vs 
net sales revenue increased in fiscal over fiscal more than half of the increase came from increased pentachlorophenol penta sales 
penta products are used principally to treat utility poles 
penta volume was up significantly for the year due to the acquisition of the penta distribution business of wood protection products  inc in december penta sales revenue also improved over the prior year because of our june penta price increase 
most of the remainder of our improved net sales revenue came from greater creosote sales volume because of increased demand by the major railroads for crossties treated with creosote 
although we completed the acquisition of the creosote distribution business of trenton sales  inc in may  that transaction did not have a significant impact on our net sales in fiscal net sales revenue from non wood treating products were also up in fiscal as compared with last fiscal year 
the improvement was from volume increases from sales of our animal health products  including the ravap product acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal we acquired animal health products for the first time in mid fiscal  and did not have the benefit of a full selling season until fiscal net sales revenue for wood treating products and other products in fiscal and is presented in the following table 
net sales revenue  in thousands wood treating products other products total gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal declined to from 
in december  we entered a long term supply agreement with the other united states penta producer in order to support the increased sales volume resulting from our acquisition of the distribution business of wood protection products 
the additional penta source addresses customer concerns respecting certainty of supply  and improves logistical and production flexibility 
purchases of penta blocks from the other producer  however  adversely affects penta margins because they are more costly than the penta blocks we produce 
margins also continued to be impacted in fiscal by the higher penta raw material costs that first began to impact us in may  phenol and chlorine costs stabilized at relatively high levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  prices for these key raw materials began to move upward once again 
we expect penta raw material costs will continue at high levels and put pressure on our margins in fiscal gross margins on wood treating products were also adversely impacted by increased creosote costs for imported product and by a greater reliance in fiscal than in fiscal on higher cost imported creosote 
vs 
net sales revenue was up in fiscal as compared with fiscal although wood treating chemical sales were down significantly due to reduced creosote sales  we benefited from substantial sales of our newly acquired animal health products 
in wood treating products  a supply shortfall in the northeast united states hampered creosote sales in fiscal and sales also suffered because certain railroads  as a cost containment measure  specified petroleum and creosote blends for crosstie treatment rather than specifying creosote alone 
creosote sales improved in the last quarter of fiscal  however  as several major railroads required a greater volume of treated crossties than in calendar although penta products pricing increased in june  that increase did not materially improve fiscal results and penta sales were flat in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
in non wood treating products  we benefited from our acquisition of animal health products midway through fiscal  but our agricultural chemical sales were essentially unchanged from the prior year 
net sales revenue for wood treating products and other products in fiscal and is presented in the following table 
net sales revenue  in thousands wood treating products other products total gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal declined to from due to higher raw material costs and lower production volume on which to allocate fixed production costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million higher than the prior year  a increase 
distribution expenses were up on increased volume in creosote and on increased penta volume because of the acquisition of wood protection products distribution business 
selling and administrative expenses went up primarily from increased amortization of the cost of our animal health and penta acquisitions and for compensation of new personnel to support those acquisitions 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased thousand over fiscal  a increase 
we also incurred increased registration expenses because of increased activity in the product reauthorization process being conducted by the epa and the addition of the rabon product line in december these increased expenses were offset by a decrease in amortization expense by approximately thousand per year because of the effect of new accounting rules 
see notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense was thousand in fiscal compared with thousand in fiscal the increase was due to an increase in term loan borrowings to conclude our animal health and wood treating product distribution acquisitions 
in  interest expense increased to thousand from thousand in the prior year due to increased borrowings for the animal health acquisition 
gain on sale of securities we sold marketable securities held in a financial institution for gains of thousand in fiscal and thousand in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal our effective rate decreased in fiscal from a effective rate in fiscal outlook for fiscal we believe that fiscal will show improvement over the acquisitions we completed in fiscal in wood treating and animal health products should add to annual net sales 
our wood treating customers are experiencing strong demand from major railroads for railroad crossties 
we expect that creosote sales will continue to be strong throughout fiscal although investor owned utilities appear to be continuing to defer utility pole purchases where possible  the recent bad weather in the southern united states should have the effect of increasing demand somewhat for utility poles to replace damage 
margins will continue to be under pressure  however  from high raw material prices 
inflation did not have a material impact on us in the last three fiscal years and is not expected to have a material impact on us in the future 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows net cash from operating activities was million in fiscal  up thousand over the improvement was largely on the strength of increased creosote trade payables due to normal variance in the timing of creosote purchases and more prompt collection of msma receivables  but offset by significant inventory purchases from our new tetrachlorvinphos supplier for our animal health products 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we entered a distribution agreement with drexel chemical company under which it became our sole distributor of msma products in the united states 
under the agreement  drexel pays a significant portion of the purchase price for msma products on days terms  while by industry practice most agricultural product distributors pay after the harvest  late in the calendar year and after our fiscal year has concluded 
in fiscal  for example  we experienced an expansion in trade accounts receivable primarily because we responded to the competitive environment in msma by offering the extended payment terms characteristic of that business 
net cash used by investing activities in fiscal increased million over  and increased million over the level 
the increases in the last two years reflect our acquisitions of the animal health product business in fiscal  and penta and creosote distribution businesses and an additional animal health product in fiscal our purchases totaled million in fiscal and million in we added million net cash from financing activities in fiscal we borrowed million in a refinancing of our senior credit facility with southtrust bank to finance acquisitions and repaid thousand during the year 
we also paid thousand in dividends 
in we added million in financing activities 
we refinanced the senior credit facility to borrow million for the purchase of the rabon animal health business 
during that year we repaid million in indebtedness and distributed thousand from available cash in dividends 
it is our policy to pay out dividends from available cash after taking into consideration our profitability  capital requirements  financial condition  growth  business opportunities and other factors which our board of directors may deem relevant 
working capital we have a working capital line of credit under a revolving credit facility with southtrust bank  but at the end of fiscal and at september   we had no borrowings under that facility 
under that credit facility  we may borrow up to the lesser of million or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable plus a portion of our inventory 
the amount available under the facility at the end of fiscal and at september  was million 
the revolving credit facility contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us  including a limitation that without consent our equity investments or loans cannot exceed thousand 
we are also required to obtain consent prior to replacing our president and chairman of the board of directors  david l 
hatcher  and prior consent for any merger  reorganization or recapitalization 
the revolving credit facility also requires that we satisfy the same financial covenants as our two term loans 
the revolving credit facility has a term ending in january we anticipate no difficulties in renewing that facility 
long term obligations our purchase of the rabon animal health products business in fiscal and our acquisitions in fiscal were financed in part by two term loans under a senior credit facility with southtrust bank 
the principal balance of the company s two term loans with southtrust bank was million at september  and at the end of fiscal the two term loans require us to satisfy financial covenants i a tangible net worth of not less than million at the end of fiscal  increasing to million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of subsequent fiscal years  ii a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to  iii a ratio of liabilities to tangible net worth of not more than to at the end of fiscal  decreasing to to at the end of fiscal and to to at the end of subsequent fiscal years  and iv a coverage ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation of not greater than to at the end of fiscal  decreasing to to at the end of fiscal and to to at the end of subsequent fiscal years 
we believe that the term loans and the revolving credit facility from southtrust bank adequately provide for our anticipated need for liquidity and capital resources in fiscal for our current operations 
we purchased the rabon animal health products business in december that purchase was funded by refinancing and increasing our then existing term loan facility with southtrust bank 
the principal amount of that loan is being amortized monthly over ten years but the maturity date is december  the loan carries interest at a varying rate equal to libor plus 
however  in february  the company entered into an interest rate swap transaction with southtrust bank which effectively fixed the interest rate at for the remainder of the term 
the principal balance outstanding on that loan was million at the end of fiscal we acquired penta distribution assets in december  and creosote distribution assets and the ravap tradename in june the purchases were financed in part by a second term loan from southtrust bank 
the original principal amount of the second term loan was million in december  but the loan was refinanced in june to reflect an additional million advance to fund our acquisitions 
the principal amount of that loan is being repaid monthly over ten years at varying installment amounts  but the maturity date is june  the second term loan carries interest at a varying rate initially equal to libor plus 
the principal amount of the loan was million at the end of fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal  our capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were approximately thousand 
about of those expenditures were incurred to dismantle and move the penta formulation and distribution equipment acquired from wood protection products and to purchase an additional six acres of land next to our plant in mexico for possible future expansion 
our capital expenditures in fiscal were at more normal levels  thousand 
in fiscal we incurred capital expenditures of million  primarily for relocation and construction of a herbicide production facility to matamoros  mexico where we make our msma products 
the msma product category was first acquired in fiscal  but the plant relocation and construction was not completed until fiscal our capital expenditures and operating expenses for environmental matters  excluding testing  data submission and other costs associated with our product task force participation  were approximately thousand in fiscal  thousand in fiscal  and thousand in fiscal the fiscal amount for environmental expenditures were greater than normal because of expenditures related to improvements pertaining to our msma product production facility in fiscal we estimate that our capital expenditures and operating expenses for environmental matters  other than testing  data submission and other costs associated with our product task force participation  will be approximately thousand in fiscal we expensed approximately thousand for testing  data submission and other costs associated with our participation in product task forces in fiscal  and approximately thousand and thousand in fiscal and the increasing expense was due to increased activity in the product reauthorization process being conducted by the epa and the addition of the rabon product line in december epa s work plan for its fiscal year ending september includes consideration of creosote  penta and msma for reregistration 
for those reasons  we believe that total testing  data submission and other costs will be approximately million in fiscal since environmental laws have traditionally become increasingly stringent  costs and expenses relating to environmental control and compliance may increase in the future 
while we do not believe that the cost of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  there can be no assurance that costs of compliance will not exceed current estimates 
we have conducted periodic groundwater sampling at our facility in tuscaloosa  alabama by agreement with the alabama department of the environmental management because a sampling revealed the presence of penta contamination 
in may   the alabama authority concluded that the contamination had been remediated and that no further corrective action was required 
contractual obligations our obligations to make future payments under contracts as of july  are summarized in the following table 
payments due by period total august  to july  august  to july  august  to july  thereafter contractural obligations long term debt operating leases long term liabilities purchase obligations off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities 
new accounting rules accounting pronouncements that became effective in fiscal or that are expected to become effective in fiscal did not have  and are not expected to have  any significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting principles that we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following revenue recognition we essentially have only one revenue recognition transaction in which our chemical products sold in the open market are recognized as revenue as risk of loss and title to the products transfers to customers  which usually occurs at the time a shipment is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for accounts receivable we believe we may not collect in full 
a provision for bad debt expense recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses increases the allowance 
accounts receivable that are written off our books decrease the allowance 
the amount of bad debt expense recorded each period and the resulting adequacy of the allowance at the end of each period are determined using a combination of our historical loss experience  customer by customer analyses of our accounts receivable balances each period and subjective assessments of our future bad debt exposure 
write offs of accounts receivable balances have historically been insignificant 
inventories inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods that we hold for sale in the ordinary course of business 
it uses the first in  first out method to value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
management believes we have not incurred impairments in the carrying value of our inventories 
goodwill and other intangible assets the initial recording of goodwill and other intangibles requires estimation of the fair value of assets and liabilities using fair value measurements  which include quoted market price  present value techniques estimate of future cash flows  and other valuation techniques 
additionally  sfas requires goodwill and other intangible assets to be reviewed for possible impairment on an annual basis  or if circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
determining fair value and the implied fair value is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the recording of intangible assets  whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of the impairment charge 
the company s estimates of fair value are primarily determined using present value techniques of projected future cash flows 
this approach uses significant assumptions such as multi year sales projections with associated expenses 
the company has performed impairment analyses on its goodwill and intangible assets of indefinite life which indicated as of july  an impairment charge was not appropriate 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of long lived assets are evaluated for potential impairment on a product line basis 
we have concluded on the basis of our evaluation that the long lived assets are not impaired 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements certain information included or incorporated by reference in this report is forward looking  including statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of operations 
it includes statements regarding our intent  belief and current expectations and our directors and officers 
forward looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could materially alter results in the future from those expressed in these statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  our ability to maintain existing relationships with long standing customers  our ability to successfully implement productivity improvements  cost reduction initiatives  facilities expansion and our ability to develop  market and sell new products include uncertainties relating to economic conditions  acquisitions and divestitures  government and regulatory policies  technological developments and changes in the competitive environment in which we operate 
persons reading this report are cautioned that such statements are only predictions and actual events or results may differ materially 
in evaluating such statements  readers should specifically consider the various factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the ordinary course of business  primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates 
we generally do not utilize derivative financial instruments or hedging transactions to manage that risk 
however  we did enter into an interest rate swap transaction in february  that effectively fixed the interest rate on one of our term loans at for the remainder of the loan s term 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not affect our earnings or cash flow over the life of the term loan because the interest rate swap serves to fix the interest rate at 
should the financial market s expectations for interest rates in the future increase then the value of the swap  recorded as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets  would increase 
conversely  a drop in the financial market s expectations for future interest rates would cause a drop in the value of that recorded asset 
it is possible that the future expectations for interest rates could decline enough to cause the swap to be recorded no longer as an asset  but as a liability  until the swap expires december at july  the market value of the swap was thousand
