since the majority of cbt s revenue results from use of the public switched telephone network  its operations follow no particular seasonal pattern 
cbt s franchise area is granted under regulatory authority  and is subject to increasing competition from a variety of companies 
cbt is not aware of any regulatory initiative that would restrict the franchise area in which it is currently able to operate 
a significant portion of revenue is derived from pricing plans that require regulatory overview and approval 
in recent years  these regulated pricing plans have resulted in decreasing or fixed rates for some services  partially offset by price increases and enhanced flexibility for other services

the network employs both time division multiple access tdma and global system for mobile communications and general packet radio service gsm gprs technology 
tdma provides both voice and short message service sms data services 
in october  cbw deployed the gsm gprs technology  which provides  in addition to voice communication and sms  enhanced wireless data communication services  such as mobile web browsing  internet access  email and picture messaging 
the gsm gprs is edge compatible  requiring only software upgrades to deliver higher data rates and capacity 
as handsets of one technology cannot generally be used on the network of the other technology  cbw plans to operate both technologies simultaneously until its tdma customer base naturally churns or migrates to gsm gprs service 
based on current estimates  the company expects that it will operate its tdma network at least through cbw s operating territory includes a licensed population licensed pops of approximately million

business outlook there is substantial competition in the telecommunications industry 
competition may intensify due to the efforts of existing competitors to address difficult market conditions through reduced pricing  bundled offerings or otherwise  as well as a result of the entrance of new competitors and the development of new technologies  products and services 
if the company cannot offer reliable  value added services on a price competitive basis in any of its markets  it could be adversely impacted by competitive forces 
in addition  if the company does not keep pace with technological advances or fails to respond timely to changes in competitive factors in the industry  the company could lose market share or experience a decline in revenue and profit margins 
excluding the broadband segment  the company expects revenue to decline in the low single digits compared to  and operating income to be in the range of million to million  as a result of higher sales and marketing expense related to the company defending its market position through incremental wireless and dsl customer acquisitions particularly into service bundles that include an access line 
in support of these expectations  in february the company launched an aggressive marketing campaign titled you add  we subtract  designed to promote further bundled suites of communications services on a single bill for a reduced flat monthly fee 
the company also expects greater depreciation expense related to shortening the estimated depreciable life of its tdma network assets to the end of the company expects capital expenditures to remain at approximately to of future revenue

cbt faces competition from other local exchange carriers  wireless services providers  interexchange carriers  cable and satellite providers and internet service providers 
the company believes cbt will face greater 
table of contents competition as more competitors emerge and focus resources on the greater cincinnati metropolitan area 
in november  time warner cable filed an application with the public utilities commission of ohio to provide local and interexchange voice service in several market areas in ohio  including cincinnati  and expects to begin offering residential service in in march  the local gas and electric supplier announced that it would begin offering high speed internet access over electrical lines to customers in cbt s operating area 
also  the emerging voice over internet protocol voip providers offering service in other areas of the country may begin offering service in cbt s operating territory 
cbw is one of six active wireless service providers in the cincinnati and dayton  ohio metropolitan market areas  including cingular  sprint pcs  t mobile  verizon and nextel  all of which are nationally known and well funded 
the company anticipates that continued competition will likely continue to cause the market prices for wireless products and services to decline in the future 
cbw s ability to compete will depend  in part  on its ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the telecommunications industry 
furthermore  as evidenced by awe s recent announcement that it has agreed to be acquired by cingular  there has been a trend in the wireless communications industry towards consolidation through joint ventures  reorganizations and acquisitions 
the company expects this consolidation to lead to larger competitors with greater resources and more service offerings than cbw 
at this time it is not completely clear what impact the cingular awe merger will have on the operations of cbw or on cingular s awe s desire to remain in the cbw venture 
however  cbw s implementation of gsm gprs should improve the company s ability to compete through preservation and enhancement of existing revenue streams  lower incremental capital expenditures per gross subscriber addition  lower network cost per minute of use  and minimal additional investment in the legacy tdma network 
the company s other subsidiaries operate in a largely local or regional area  and each of these subsidiaries faces significant competition 
cbad s competitors include resellers  competitive local exchange providers and large national long distance carriers such as at t corp  mci and sprint corporation  in addition to emerging voip providers 
public competes with several other public payphone providers  some of which are national in scope and offer lower prices for coin based local calling services 
public has also continued to be adversely impacted by the growing penetration of wireless communications 
brcom s cbts subsidiary competes against numerous other information technology consulting  computer system integration and managed service providers  many of which are larger  national in scope and better financed 
the company intends to continue to utilize its investment in its local wireline communications network and its regional wireless network to provide new and incremental product and service offerings to its customers in the greater cincinnati and dayton  ohio markets and utilize its well regarded brand name to enter new markets near its current operating territory

in addition  certain of our material subsidiaries are subject to debt obligations or regulatory issues that potentially restrict their ability to distribute funds or assets to the company 
if the company s subsidiaries were to be prohibited from paying dividends and making distributions to the company  it would have a material adverse effect on the company and the trading price of the cincinnati bell common stock  preferred stock and debt instruments 
the company s creditors and preferred stockholders will have claims to the assets and earnings of these subsidiaries that are superior to claims of the holders of cincinnati bell common stock 
accordingly  in the event of the company s dissolution  bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization  amounts may not be available for payments to cincinnati bell common stock holders until after the payment in full of the claims of creditors of the company s subsidiaries and preferred stockholders

the company depends on the credit facilities to provide for financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations 
as of december   the company had the ability to borrow an additional million under its credit facilities 
however  the ability to borrow from the credit facilities is predicated on the company s and its subsidiaries compliance with covenants 
failure to satisfy these covenants could severely constrain its ability to borrow under the credit facilities 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all of the covenants of its credit facilities 
as a result of the restatement of the company s previously issued financial statements  discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company was in default on its credit agreement and senior subordinated discount notes notes indenture  and as a result of cross default provisions  the cincinnati bell telephone notes 
in march  the company s credit agreement and notes indenture were amended to provide that the restatement does not constitute an event of default  which eliminated the cross default of the cincinnati bell telephone notes 
the credit facilities and other indebtedness impose significant restrictions on the company 
the company s debt instruments impose  and the terms of any future debt may impose  operating and other restrictions on the company 
these restrictions affect  and in many respects limit or prohibit  among other things  the company s and its subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  
table of contents make investments  enter into transactions with affiliates  sell assets  guarantee indebtedness  declare or pay dividends or other distributions to shareholders  repurchase equity interests  redeem debt that is junior in right of payment to such indebtedness  enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from subsidiaries  issue or sell capital stock of certain of its subsidiaries  and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets and the assets of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
in addition  the company s credit facilities include other more restrictive covenants that may materially limit the company s ability to prepay other debt and preferred stock while debt under the credit facilities is outstanding 
the agreements governing the credit facilities also require the company to achieve specified financial results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios 
the restrictions contained in the terms of the credit facilities and its other debt instruments could limit the company s ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict the company s activities or business plans  limit the means by which the company may fund awe s right to put its interests in cbw to the company  which right begins on december   and adversely affect the company s ability to finance its operations  strategic acquisitions  investments or alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in its interest 
a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the company s inability to comply with the required financial ratios and financial results could result in a default under the credit facilities 
if a default occurs  the lenders under the credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable 
the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings 
additionally  the company s debt instruments contain cross acceleration provisions  which generally cause each instrument to accelerate upon a qualifying acceleration of any other debt instrument 
the company operates in a highly competitive industry and its customers may not continue to purchase services  which could result in reduced revenue and loss of market share 
there is substantial competition in the telecommunications industry 
competition may intensify due to the efforts of existing or new competitors to address difficult market conditions through reduced pricing  bundled offerings or otherwise  as well as a result of the entrance of new competitors and the development of new technologies  products and services 
if the company cannot offer reliable  value added services on a price competitive basis in any of its markets  it could be adversely impacted by competitive forces 
in addition  if the company does not keep pace with technological advances or fails to respond timely to changes in competitive factors in the industry  it could lose market share or experience a decline in its revenue and profit margins 

table of contents maintaining the company s networks requires significant capital expenditures and its inability or failure to maintain its networks would have a material impact on its market share and ability to generate revenue 
during the year ended december   capital expenditures totaled million 
the company may incur significant additional capital expenditures as a result of unanticipated expenses  regulatory changes and other events that impact the business 
if the company is unable or fails to adequately maintain or expand its networks to meet customer needs  there could be a material adverse impact on the company s market share and its ability to generate revenue 
maintenance of cbw s wireless network  growth in the wireless business or the addition of new wireless products and services may require cbw to obtain additional spectrum  which may not be available or be available only on less than favorable terms 
the tdma wireless network currently operates on spectrum  which the fcc has licensed to cbw 
for its gsm network  cbw uses spectrum licensed to the company or to awe 
introduction of new wireless products and services  as well as maintenance of the existing wireless business  may require cbw to obtain additional spectrum in the cincinnati or dayton markets  either to supplement or to replace the existing spectrum 
there can be no assurance that such spectrum will be available to cbw  or will be available on commercially favorable terms 
failure to obtain any needed new spectrum or to retain existing spectrum could have a materially adverse impact on the wireless business as a whole  the quality of the wireless networks  and the ability to offer new competitive products and services 
the regulation of the businesses by federal and state authorities may  among other things  place the company at a competitive disadvantage  restrict its ability to price its products and services and threaten its operating licenses 
several of the company s subsidiaries are subject to regulatory oversight of varying degrees at both the state and federal levels 
pricing plans that require regulatory overview and approval produce a significant portion of cbt s revenue 
different interpretations by regulatory bodies may result in adjustments to revenue in future periods 
in recent years  these regulated pricing plans have resulted in decreasing or fixed rates for some services 
in the future  regulatory initiatives that would put cbt at a competitive disadvantage or mandate lower rates for its services could result in lower profitability and cash flow for the company 
at the federal level  cbt is subject to the telecommunications act of  including the rules subsequently adopted by the fcc to implement the act  which the company expects to impact cincinnati bell telephone s in territory local exchange operations in the form of greater competition 
at the state level  cbt conducts local exchange operations in portions of ohio  kentucky and indiana and  consequently  is subject to regulation by the public utilities commissions in those states 
in ohio  the public utility commission has concluded a proceeding to establish permanent rates that cbt can charge to competitive local exchange carriers for unbundled network elements  although some elements will remain subject to interim rates indefinitely 
the kentucky commission recently initiated a similar case to establish rates for unbundled network elements in kentucky 
the establishment of these rates is intended to facilitate market entry by competitive local exchange carriers 
cbt is also subject to an alternative regulation plan in ohio 
the current plan gives cbt pricing flexibility in several competitive service categories in exchange for its commitment to freeze certain basic residential service rates during the term of the plan 
the term of the current plan will expire on june  cbw s fcc licenses to provide wireless services are subject to renewal and revocation 
although the fcc has routinely renewed wireless licenses in the past  the company cannot be assured that challenges will not be 
table of contents brought against those licenses in the future 
revocation or non renewal of cbw s licenses would result in lower operating results and cash flow for the company 
there are currently many regulatory actions under way and being contemplated by federal and state authorities regarding issues that could result in significant changes to the business conditions in the telecommunications industry 
changes in current or future regulations adopted by the fcc  or state regulators  or other legislative  administrative  or judicial initiatives relating to the telecommunications industry  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the financial markets and the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect the company s operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states of america  us businesses or armed conflict involving the united states of america 
further terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may directly impact the company s physical facilities or those of its customers and vendors 
these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and world financial markets and economy 
they could result in an economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company expects to experience significant change in the wireless communications industry 
the wireless communications industry is experiencing technological change 
this includes digital upgrades  evolving industry standards  ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology  shorter development cycles for new products and changes in customer needs and preferences 
cbw currently offers its services over a digital wireless network using time division multiple access  or tdma  technology 
in october  the company implemented gsm gprs technology  which several competitors  as well as the company s wireless partner awe  have already implemented 
this new technology is currently running concurrent with the tdma technology and will continue to do so through at least december  under the company s current estimates 
however  the prospects of the company s wireless business will depend on the success of its conversion to gsm gprs technology and its ability to anticipate and adapt to future changes in the wireless communications industry 
the purchase of awe by cingular wireless could have a significant impact on the composition and operations of our wireless subsidiary 
awe announced in february that it agreed to be purchased by cingular wireless 
awe owns of cbw  which comprises the substantial portion of the wireless segment 
in connection with the sale  cingular awe announced their intention to accelerate their migration away from tdma technology 
in addition to being a part owner of cbw  awe provides roaming services for tdma and gsm  and allows cbw to use spectrum  under the terms of various commercial agreements 
the parties also have reciprocal non competition obligations as specified in the operating agreement between the company and awe 
at this time it is not completely clear what impact the cingular awe merger will have on the operations of cbw or on cingular s awe s desire to remain in the cbw venture 
however  a decision by cingular awe to exit or limit its involvement in cbw  or to not renew the commercial roaming and spectrum use arrangements beyond their current terms could have a material impact on the business unless cbw were able to obtain alternative commercial arrangements on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  it is unclear whether a decision by cingular awe to accelerate their migration away from tdma would impact the schedule of the company s 
table of contents own tdma migration 
the company currently anticipates completing its migration by the end of an acceleration before then could require additional capital expenditures  costs  expenses and asset impairments and could result in the loss of revenue 
the company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and human safety 
the company s operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and human safety  including those governing the management and disposal of  and exposure to  hazardous materials and the cleanup of contamination  and the emission of radio frequency 
while the company believes its operations are in substantial compliance with environmental and health and human safety laws and regulations  as an owner or operator of property and in connection with the current and historical use of hazardous materials  underground storage tanks and other operations at its sites  the company could incur significant costs resulting from violations or liabilities under such laws  the imposition of cleanup obligations  and third party suits 
the company s share price may be volatile 
the company s share price may fluctuate substantially as a result of periodic variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the company s business or other companies in the telecommunications industry or markets served by the company 
in addition  the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many telecommunications stocks and have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of some of these companies 
fluctuations such as these have affected and are likely to continue to affect the share price of the company s common stock 
in addition  many of the risks described in this section could materially and adversely affect the company s share price 
during and  a number of putative class action and derivative lawsuits were filed against the company and certain of its current and former officers and directors

the company restated its financial statements to reflect the revised accounting for this contract 
in investigating plaintiffs other allegations  the audit committee did not identify any information that warranted any modification or change to the company s financial statements 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and have a material impact on the financial condition  results of operation and cash flow of the company 
the company could be required to pay substantial damages  if the company were to lose any of these lawsuits 
the company s operations are focused on a limited geographic area 
substantially all of the company s revenue is generated by serving customers in the greater cincinnati and dayton  ohio areas

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
the company continually evaluates its estimates  including but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  income taxes  fixed assets  depreciation  access line costs  restructuring  pensions  other postretirement benefits and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies impact the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the company s senior management has discussed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and finance committee 
for a more detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue as services are provided 
local access fees are billed monthly  in advance  while revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
postpaid wireless  switched voice and data and internet product services are billed monthly in arrears  while the revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
equipment revenue is generally recognized upon performance of contractual obligations  such as shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance 
prior to the sale of the broadband assets in the second and third quarter of refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  broadband transport services were billed monthly  in advance  while revenue was recognized as the services were provided 
in addition  the company had entered into indefeasible right of use iru agreements  which represent the lease of network capacity or dark fiber  recording unearned revenue at the earlier of the acceptance of the applicable portion of the network by the customer or the receipt of cash 
the buyer of iru services typically paid cash or other consideration upon execution of the contract  and the associated iru revenue was recognized over the life of the agreement as services were provided  beginning on the date of customer acceptance 
in the event the buyer of an iru terminated a contract prior to the contract expiration and released the company from the obligation to provide future services  the remaining unamortized unearned revenue was recognized in the period in which the contract was terminated 
concurrent with the broadband asset sale  substantially all of the remaining iru obligations were assumed by the buyer 
cost of providing service prior to the sale of the broadband assets refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company maintained an accrued liability related to the broadband business for the cost of circuits leased from other carriers and access minutes of use not yet invoiced in order to appropriately record such costs in the period incurred 
the company determined the estimate of the accrued cost of service liability based on a variety of factors including circuits added or disconnected during the period  expected recovery of disputed amounts and the mix of domestic and international access minutes of use 
if the actual amounts recovered from disputes were less than expected or other charges were greater than expected  an additional accrual and related expense was recorded 
concurrent with the broadband asset sale  the accrued liability for cost of providing service was assumed by the buyer 
income taxes the income tax provision consists of an amount for taxes currently payable and an expense or benefit for tax consequences deferred to future periods 
the ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends upon the company s ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which basis 
table of contents differences and other deductions become deductible and prior to the expiration of its net operating loss carryforwards 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reversed million of deferred tax asset valuation allowance previously established primarily due to the uncertainties surrounding brcom s liquidity that were substantially mitigated 
in the company expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 
as of december   the company had net deferred tax assets of million  which included a valuation allowance of million related to certain state and local net operating loss carryforwards 
the company concluded  due to the sale of the broadband business and the historical and future projected earnings of the remaining businesses  that the company will utilize future deductions and available net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
the company also concluded that it was more likely than not that certain state tax net operating loss carryforwards would not be realized based upon the analysis described above and therefore provided a valuation allowance 
allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable the company establishes the allowances for uncollectible accounts using both percentages of aged accounts receivable balances to reflect the historical average of credit losses and specific provisions for certain large  potentially uncollectible balances 
the company believes its allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate based on the methods previously described 
however  if one or more of the company s larger customers were to default on its accounts receivable obligations  or general economic conditions in the company s operating area deteriorated  the company could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment the company s provision for depreciation of telephone plant is determined on a straight line basis using the whole life and remaining life methods 
provision for depreciation of other property is based on the straight line method over the estimated economic useful life 
repairs and maintenance expense items are charged to expense as incurred 
beginning in  in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  the cost of removal for telephone plant was included in costs of products and services as incurred 
in connection with this accounting change  on january   the company recorded a benefit of million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of taxes  related to the adoption of sfas refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  the company revised the estimated economic useful life of its wireless tdma network due to the implementation of and expected migration to its gsm gprs network 
the company shortened its estimate of the economic useful life of its tdma network to december  the wireless segment recorded additional depreciation expense of million to reflect the acceleration of depreciation for the tdma network 
if the migration to gsm gprs technology occurs more rapidly than the company s current estimates  the company may be required to revise its estimate further or record an impairment charge related to its tdma network 
in  the change in estimate reduced operating income and net income by million and million  respectively 
in  basic and diluted earnings per share were decreased by and  respectively  as a result of this change in estimate 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price consideration over the fair value of assets acquired recorded in connection with purchase business combinations 
indefinite lived intangible assets consist primarily of federal communications commission fcc licenses for spectrum of the wireless segment 
the company determined that its wireless licenses met the definition of indefinite lived intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas as the company believes the need for wireless spectrum will continue independently of technology and the company may renew the wireless licenses in a routine manner every ten 
table of contents years for a nominal fee  provided the company continues to meet the service and geographic coverage provisions required by the fcc 
upon the adoption of sfas on january   the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  million  net of tax  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  related to the broadband segment and ceased amortization of remaining goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to sfas  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
for goodwill  a two step impairment test is performed 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is in excess of the implied fair value of that goodwill  then an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
impairment of long lived assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the company reviews the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets discussed above  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset or group of assets and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed an impairment assessment of its broadband segment long lived assets as a result of the restructuring plan implemented during the quarter and the strategic alternatives being explored  including the potential sale of the broadband business 
this assessment considered all of the contemplated strategic alternatives for the broadband segment  including a potential sale of assets  using a probability weighted approach 
based on this assessment  the company determined that the long lived assets of broadband segment were impaired and recorded a  million non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of these assets 
of the total charge   million related to tangible fixed assets and million related to finite lived intangible assets 
the company recorded a million asset impairment in the fourth quarter of to write down the value of its public payphone assets to fair value 
the company calculated the fair value of the assets utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the best estimate of projected cash flows from the underlying assets 
pension and postretirement benefits the company calculates net periodic pension and postretirement expenses and liabilities on an actuarial basis under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits sfas 
the key assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to these plans 

table of contents the most significant of these numerous assumptions  which are reviewed annually  include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate is selected based on current market interest rates on high quality  fixed income investments at december of each year 
the health care cost trend rate is based on actual claims experience and future projections of medical cost trends 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions and other changes 
revisions to and variations from these estimates would impact assets  liabilities  costs of services and products and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table represents the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions related to the company s pension and postretirement plans pension benefits postretirement and other benefits point increase decrease increase decrease increase decrease increase decrease dollars in millions change in obligation in expense in obligation in expense discount rate expected return on assets health care cost trend n a n a the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  developed using the building block approach  is based on the following the participant s benefit horizons  the mix of investments held directly by the plans  which is generally equities and bonds  and  the current view of expected future returns  which is influenced by historical averages 
the required use of an expected versus actual long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension expense or income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns 
to the extent the company changed its estimate of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  there would be an impact on pension expense or income and the associated net liability or asset 
in its pension calculations  the company utilizes the market related value of plan assets  which is a calculated asset value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and rational manner 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market related value of plan assets over five years 
changes in actual asset return experience and discount rate assumptions can impact the company s operating results  financial position and cash flows 
actual asset return experience results in an increase or decrease in the asset base and this effect  in conjunction with a decrease in the pension discount rate  may result in a plan s assets being less than a plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo 
the abo is the present value of benefits earned to date and is based on past compensation levels 
the company is required to show in its consolidated balance sheet a net liability that is at least equal to the abo less the market value of plan assets 
this liability is referred to as an additional minimum pension liability aml 
an aml  which is recorded and updated on december each year  is reflected as a long term pension liability with the offset recorded as an intangible asset  to the extent the company has unrecognized prior service costs  with the remainder recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet  net of tax 
the actuarial expense calculation for the postretirement health plan is based on numerous assumptions  estimates and judgments including health care cost trend rates and cap related cost sharing 
certain of the company s non management labor contracts contain an annual dollar value cap for the purpose of determining postretirement health care contributions required from retirees 
the company has waived cost sharing in excess of the cap during the current contract period  but will begin collecting certain cost sharing payments from certain non management employees beginning in the caps for certain contracts are set during each bargaining cycle in connection with the negotiation of the overall contract 
in accordance with the provisions of

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company uses a combination of variable rate short term and fixed rate long term financial instruments 
the company has historically employed derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or enter into interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company was required by terms of its credit facility to engage in interest rate swaps once certain thresholds were exceeded with regard to floating rate debt as a percentage of the company s total debt 
the company exceeded this threshold during and  accordingly  entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements on notional amounts totaling million 
the company continued to exceed the above noted threshold in and increased the notional amount to million 
throughout  these agreements expired 
the purpose of these agreements was to hedge against changes in market interest rates to be charged on the company s borrowings under its credit facility 
the march credit facility amendment and restatement eliminated the requirement to maintain a certain threshold of fixed rate debt as a percentage of the company s total debt 
swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts between the parties 
because the notional amounts are not exchanged  the notional amounts of these agreements are not indicative of the company s exposure resulting from these derivatives 
the amounts to be exchanged between the parties are primarily the result of the swap s notional amount and the fixed and floating rate percentages to be charged on the swap 
in accordance with sfas  interest rate differentials associated with the company s interest rate swaps are recorded as an adjustment to interest payable or receivable with the offset to interest expense over the life of the swap 
the company s interest rate swap agreements expired throughout during  the fair value of the interest rate swaps increased resulting in a year to date  after tax net gain of million  which was recognized in other comprehensive income loss 
potential nonperformance by counterparties to the swap agreements exposes the company to a certain amount of credit risk due to the possibility of counterparty default 
because the company s only counterparties in these transactions are financial institutions that are at least investment grade  it believes the risk of counterparty default is minimal 
interest rate risk management the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs
