item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ict is a leading global provider of outsourced business services solutions 
the company provides a comprehensive mix of sales  service  marketing and business services outsourcing solutions 
the company manages its service operations in the us  europe  canada  australia  mexico  barbados and the philippines from which it supports domestic and multinational corporations and institutions  primarily in the financial  insurance  telecommunications  healthcare  information technology  media and consumer electronics industries 
the company also provides various types of hosted crm solutions for use by clients at their own in house facility or on a co sourced basis in conjunction with ict 
the company classifies its operations into two business segments domestic and international 
the operating segments are managed separately because each operating segment represents a strategic business unit that offers its services in different geographic markets 
the domestic segment provides inbound and outbound telesales  as well as database marketing services  marketing research services  technology hosting services and ongoing customer care management services on behalf of customers operating in the company s target industries 
the international segment provides the same services to europe  canada  mexico and australia  and includes business supporting the us hispanic and latin american markets 
this segment also includes business from ict s operations centers in barbados and the philippines  which provide cost effective  near shore and offshore sales and service support for clients the company generally operates under month to month contractual relationships with its teleservices clients 
the pricing component of a contract is often comprised of a base service charge and separate charges for ancillary services 
services are generally based upon an hourly rate for outbound calls and per minute rates for inbound calls 
on occasion  the company performs services for which it is paid incentives based on completed sales 
the company s customer care clients typically enter into longer term  contractual relationships that may contain provisions for early contract terminations 
revenue is earned generally as the services are provided  however certain types of revenue must be deferred and recognized over a period of time  typically the length of the customer contract 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following discussion addresses the company s critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
however  the company is not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with its audit committee 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue as services are performed  generally based on hours of work incurred 
revenue is typically calculated based on contracted hourly rates with customers 
in order to provide its business services solutions  the company incurs certain up front project setup costs specific to each customer contract 
in certain instances  the company can bill the customer for these costs  however  because the delivered item project set up costs does not have stand alone value to the customer  revenue is deferred and recognized as services are provided over the contract term or until contract termination  should that occur prior to the end of the contract term 
to the extent the company has billed these costs and there are no customer issues with collection  the company defers the project set up costs and amortizes such amounts as the services are provided over the 
table of contents remaining contract term or until contract termination 
the amount of the costs that are incurred are deferred only to the extent of the amounts billed 
amounts collected from customers prior to the performance of services are also recorded as deferred revenue 
total deferred revenue was approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively  and is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
management believes that its revenue recognition policies are in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf finalized its consensus on eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on the timing and method of revenue recognition for sales arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
the company adopted eitf issue as of july   on a prospective basis  as provided for by the eitf 
the adoption of eitf issue did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable balances are net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts 
management continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon the company s historical write off experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
other items considered in estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts include the balance of over day receivables  the financial status of the company s customers and general economic conditions 
while management believes the reserve estimate to be appropriate  it may be necessary to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if future bad debt expense exceeds the estimated reserve 
the company is subject to concentration risks as certain of its customers provide a high percent of total revenue and corresponding receivables 
accounts receivable as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively  representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
given the significance of accounts receivable to the company s consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
long lived assets management continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of the company s long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets is used to measure recoverability 
if impairment is indicated  measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets  generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
impairment charges totaling approximately  were recognized as part of the million restructuring charge recorded in the year ended december  for the year ended december   additional impairment charges of  were recognized 
net property and equipment as of december  and december  totaled million and million  respectively  representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
additionally  goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately and of total assets as of december  and december   respectively 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income 
a portion of the company s deferred tax asset relates to net operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes 
management does not believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
accordingly  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million against these assets 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
at december  a non us 
subsidiary of the company had net operating loss carry forward for tax purposes of approximately million that do not expire 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates and assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and adjusts valuation allowances if required 

table of contents restructuring charges as of december   the company had a remaining accrual of million for the amount of estimated costs required to terminate the leases and close the facilities included in the december  restructuring 
the original charge of million consisted of severance  site closure costs and asset impairments 
certain estimates were made in determining the amount of the charge for site closure costs and asset impairments  but did not include estimates for sublease income given the market conditions at that time and the inability to find suitable tenants 
the amount of the charge continues to be subject to change over time if a suitable tenant is identified or to the extent the company is able to negotiate early lease terminations 
during the year ended december   the company negotiated lease termination settlements and entered into a sublease arrangement for certain facilities that were part of the december restructuring 
to reflect the lease termination settlements and sublease arrangement along with other adjustments to the estimates   of the restructuring accrual associated with the facilities was reversed 
during the implementation of the restructuring plan in  management identified additional assets for which the company currently has no plan to utilize in other facilities 
these assets have been classified as assets held for disposal and have been written down to fair value  resulting in an impairment charge of  the  reversal of the restructuring accrual and  asset impairment have been recorded in the restructuring charge line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
on a quarterly basis  management will continue to evaluate and assess the appropriateness of the accrual and will adjust it as necessary 
also during  one individual who was receiving monthly severance as part of the restructuring secured new employment  which partially voided his agreement with the company 
approximately  of his remaining severance was reversed in the fourth quarter 
this reversal was also recorded in the restructuring charge line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
all remaining severance  approximately  is to be paid in the first quarter of accounting for contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company has entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  the company could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships  or from its relationships with its employees 
the company accounts for contingencies such as these in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
requires the company to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of its consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
sfas no 
and its interpretations further states that when there is a range of loss and no amount within that range is a better estimate than any other  that the minimum amount in the range shall be accrued 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires company management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  the accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in the company s results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
as of december   accruals for loss contingencies  excluding estimated legal fees to defend the company against currently pending matters  totaled million and are included in accrued litigation costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the contingency relates to an ongoing lawsuit filed in by a former employee  william shingleton

the increase in direct labor costs is generally attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  program set up costs associated with the ramp up of new programs  and a shift in the company s business mix to include a greater proportion of services revenue  which typically have a higher labor rate per hour 
the overall effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cost of services was approximately million

on april   the circuit court of berkeley county  west virginia entered an order in the ongoing class action lawsuit granting the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on the method of calculation of liquidated damages under the west virginia wage payment and collection act 
the court ruled that  under the act  every class member who was not paid transition time  short breaks or other wages is owed liquidated damages equal to a day s wages for every day the amounts due remained unpaid up to days 
there are recent supreme court rulings  however  which limit an award of punitive damages relative to the compensatory damages awarded in the same matter 
in older cases  the supreme court found that liquidated damages imposed for violations of law are subject to limitations similar to those applicable to punitive damage awards 
accordingly  as a result of the april  court order and taking into consideration subsequent supreme court rulings and lower court rulings  the company recorded a charge of million during the year ended december   representing the company s estimate of compensatory damages  liquidated damages and other costs  including accrued interest

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
to meet disclosure requirements  the company performs a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on its debt and other financial instruments 
information provided by the sensitivity analysis does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that the company would incur under normal market conditions because  due to practical limitations  all variables other than the specific market risk factor are held constant 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable rate line of credit 
a change in market interest rates exposes the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instrument 
borrowings under the company s line of credit are subject to variable libor or prime base rate pricing 
accordingly  a change basis points in the libor rate and the prime rate would have resulted in interest expense changing by approximately  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the rate on million of outstanding borrowings at december  approximated market rates  thus  the fair value of the debt approximates its reported value 
in the past the company has not entered into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or interest rate lock agreements 
however  it may consider these instruments to manage the impact of changes in interest rates based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and the company s ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner 
foreign currency risk the company has operations in canada  ireland  the united kingdom  australia  barbados  mexico  and the philippines that are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of income statements of these operations from local currencies to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
the company s foreign operations represented of the company s consolidated revenue for the year ended december  additionally  the foreign operations performed of the production hours for the domestic business segment 

table of contents the company s most significant foreign currency exposures to be hedged occur when revenue is generated in one foreign currency and corresponding expenses are generated in another foreign currency 
the company s most significant exposure has been with its canadian operations  where revenues are generated in us dollars usd and the corresponding expenses are generated in canadian dollars cad 
when the value of the cad increases against the usd  cad denominated expenses increase and operating margins are negatively impacted 
partially offsetting this exposure is indigenous canadian business and associated profitability where usd profits will be higher in a period of a strong cad 
in june  the company finalized a strategy to hedge a portion of anticipated operating costs and payables associated with the cad  primarily payroll expenses  rental expenses and other known recurring expenses  on a monthly basis to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of foreign currencies will continue to present economic challenges for the company and could negatively impact overall earnings 
a change in the value of the usd relative to foreign currencies could have had an impact of approximately  on the company s annual earnings in
