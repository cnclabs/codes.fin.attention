outlook management believes that near term growth in the laser macro business depends  especially in north america and europe  on the general investment cycle for capital goods 
revenues from a technical license will contribute to sales in the next fiscal year by approximately million 
in the marking and micro businesses management sees after the fourth quarter peak some softening of the demand in the semiconductor sector  but the company does not consider it an indication of a deepening downward trend 
the company believes that its broad product portfolio and its diversified customer base should help mitigate a worsening of business conditions in single industrial or geographical markets in the future 
the recent acquisitions of prc and lee laser should further strengthen its position in the north american market for industrial lasers  increase its customer base in the us and asia and generally further consolidate the company s worldwide market position in industrial lasers 
management will continue to invest in increasing its sales and service activities in asia

there are no financial covenants which would restrict the company from drawing money under these lines of credit 
additionally  the company has outstanding short term and long term debt with a german bank  which was used to finance part of the acquisition  and to refinance the existing debt  of baasel lasertech 
at september   million was outstanding under this credit agreement

net sales and costs and related assets and liabilities are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the operations  thereby serving to reduce the company s exposure to exchange gains and losses 
exchange differences upon translation from each operation s functional currency to us dollars are accumulated as a separate component of equity 
the currency translation adjustment component of shareholders equity had the effect of increasing total equity by million at september  as compared to million at september  the fluctuation of the euro and the other relevant functional currencies against the us dollar has had the effect of increasing or decreasing as applicable reported net sales  as well as cost of goods sold and gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses  denominated in such foreign currencies when translated into us dollars as compared to prior periods 
the following table illustrates the effect of the changes in exchange rates on the company s fiscal  and net sales  gross profit and income from operations 
fiscal fiscal fiscal at at at exchange exchange exchange actual rates actual rates actual rates in millions net sales gross profit income from operations between fiscal and  the euro yearly average strengthened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this strengthening was to increase net sales and gross profit by million and million  respectively  because approximately of sales are denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro 
however  because approximately of operating expenses are also denominated in these other currencies  this same strengthening of the euro had the effect of increasing operating expenses  thereby only increasing income from operations by million

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for uncollectible customer accounts receivable based on historical experience 
additionally  an allowance is made based on an assessment of specific customers financial condition and liquidity 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
no individual customer represents more than of total accounts receivable 
any increase in allowance will impact operating income during a given period 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  after provisions for excess and obsolete inventory salable at prices below cost 
provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on current assessments about historical experience and future product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
these factors are impacted by market conditions  technology changes  and changes in strategic direction  and require estimates and management judgment that may include elements that are uncertain 
the company evaluates the adequacy of these provisions quarterly 
although the company strives to achieve a balance between market demands and risk of inventory excess or obsolescence  it is possible that  should conditions change  additional provisions may be needed 
any changes in provisions will impact operating income during a given period 
warranty reserves the company provides reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties when revenue is recognized 
the company relies upon historical experience  expectation of future conditions  and its service data to estimate its warranty reserve 
the company continuously monitors these data to ensure that the reserve is sufficient 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims such costs may include material  labor and travel costs  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
increases in reserves will impact operating income during the period 
while such expenses have historically been within its expectations  the company cannot guarantee this will continue in the future 
pension obligations the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
assumptions are made about interest rates  expected investment return on plan assets  total turnover rates  and rates of future compensation increases 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop our valuations 
the company generally reviews these assumptions at the beginning of each fiscal year 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions that the company may use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension benefits expense the company has recorded or may record 
the discount rate enables the company to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the rate the company has selected represents the market rate of high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity as of september   the company maintained a cash equivalents portfolio of million  consisting mainly of non taxable interest bearing securities and demand deposits all with maturities of less than three months 
if short term interest rates were to increase or decrease by  there would be no material impact on interest income due to the low level of interest rates in the current year 
at september   the company had million of variable rate debt on which the interest rate is reset every six months  million of variable rate debt on which the interest rate is set annually and million of fixed rate debt 
maturities of this debt are as follows million is due in  million is due in  million is due in  and million is due in a change in the variable interest rates of the company s debt would result in an increase or decrease in pre tax interest expense of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and forward exchange options generally of less than one year duration to hedge a portion of its foreign currency risk on sales transactions 
at september   the company held euro forward exchange options with notional amounts of million 
the gains or losses resulting from a change in currency exchange rates would result in a pretax gain of million 
additionally  the company entered into currency and interest swap agreements of total notional amount million swiss franc to minimize the interest expense on short and long term debt 
as of september   an amount of million swiss franc equivalent to million based on the exchange rate at september  was outstanding under these swap agreements 
the gains or losses resulting from a change in currency exchange rates would result in an increase of million or a decrease of million of net income after tax
