we undertake no obligation to revise the forward looking statements included in this annual report to reflect any future events or circumstances 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company committed to the clinical development and commercialization of new therapeutics to serve unmet medical needs 
on february   we announced the completion of our merger with genesoft pharmaceuticals  a privately held pharmaceutical company based in south san francisco  california 
our product portfolio is now led by the fda approved fluoroquinolone antibiotic factive gemifloxacin mesylate tablets  indicated for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis 
for the near term  we intend to focus our efforts on the launch of commercial sales of factive tablets for these indications 
we anticipate the launch of factive will occur in the second half of in addition  we are developing a novel antibiotic candidate  ramoplanin  which is currently in clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of serious hospital acquired infections 
ramoplanin is in a phase iii trial for the prevention of bloodstream infections caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci and in a phase ii trial for the treatment of clostridium difficile associated diarrhea 
in the first quarter of and past fiscal years  we also received revenues from our genomics services business from selling  as a contract service business  high quality genomic sequencing information to our customers 
as part of our continued evolution into a focused biopharmaceutical company  on march   we completed the sale of our genomics services business to privately held agencourt bioscience corporation agencourt 
as part of the agreement  we transferred our sequencing operations  including certain equipment and personnel to agencourt 
we received an up front cash payment of  and shares of agencourt s common stock 
we will also receive a percentage of revenues from our former commercial and government customers  transferred to agencourt  for a period of two years from the date of sale 
we retain rights to our pathogenome tm database product  including all associated intellectual property  subscriptions and royalty rights on products developed by subscribers 
furthermore  we retained the capabilities necessary to satisfy our existing research needs 
we do not expect the sale of the genomics services business to have a significant impact on our net loss during the next year because of reductions in costs associated with this sale and our rights to receive royalties on gene sequencing revenue earned by agencourt that is related to the transferred business for a period of two years from the date of sale 
in connection with the sale of our genomics services business  we determined that certain equipment related to this segment would no longer be used and was abandoned subsequent to the sale 
as a result  we revised the estimated useful lives of this equipment and recorded additional depreciation expense of  during the fourth quarter of we also evaluated and wrote down our excess inventory of disposables related to the genomics services business by  during the fourth quarter of additionally  through this divestiture  we eliminated approximately full time positions  of which approximately employees were not offered employment with agencourt 
we recorded a charge of approximately  in the first quarter of  of which approximately  was related to the transfer of assets to agencourt and approximately  was associated with the reduction in work force  such as severance costs and outplacement services 
as of december   all payments related to both severance and outplacement services had been made 
in december  the company sold its pending applications related to the organism streptococcus pneumoniae to aventis pasteur for a one time cash payment of  the company has recorded this payment as other income in its consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  previously  we received payments from our product discovery alliances based on license fees  contract research and milestone payments during the term of our alliances 
we anticipate that our alliances will result in the discovery and commercialization of novel pharmaceutical  vaccine and diagnostic products 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  it will be necessary for our product discovery partner to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  obtain regulatory clearances  manufacture  sell  and distribute the product 
accordingly  we do not expect to receive royalties based upon product revenues for many years  if at all 
we anticipate that we will also generate revenue from the sale of factive tablets following its launch in the second half of the merger with genesoft will be accounted for as a purchase by us under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
under the purchase method of accounting  we are considered the acquirer and the assets and liabilities of genesoft will be recorded  as of the date of the merger of february   at their respective fair values and added to those of our company 
reported financial condition and results of operations of our company issued after february  will reflect genesoft s balances and results after completion of the merger  but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of genesoft 
following february   the earnings of the combined company will reflect purchase accounting adjustments  including in process research and development charges and amortization and depreciation expense for acquired tangible and intangible assets 
the most significant of the intangible assets identified will have finite lives and relate to factive 
these amounts will be amortized over their expected useful lives 
goodwill will also be recorded  however  pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill will not be amortized but subject to annual impairment review 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over the next several years due to the implementation of manufacturing  distribution  marketing and sales capabilities  as well as continued research and development efforts  preclinical testing and clinical trials major research and development projects factive gemifloxacin mesylate tablets in october  genesoft  now a subsidiary of ours  entered into a license and option agreement with lg life sciences to develop and commercialize gemifloxacin  a novel quinolone antibiotic  in north america  france  germany  the united kingdom  luxembourg  ireland  italy  spain  portugal  belgium  the netherlands  austria  greece  sweden  denmark  finland  norway  iceland  switzerland  andorra  monaco  san marino and vatican city 
the term of the agreement extends at least through gemifloxacin s patent life which currently expires in with respect to the principal patents for gemifloxacin  and the term could extend further depending upon several factors  including whether we obtain patent extensions and the timing of our commercial sale of the product in a particular country 
the product was approved for sale in the united states in april for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity 
under the terms of our agreement  lg life sciences has agreed to supply and we are obligated to purchase from lg life sciences all of our anticipated commercial requirements for factive bulk drug substance 
lg life sciences is expected to supply the factive bulk drug substance from its manufacturing facility in south korea 
lg life sciences has an agreement with sb pharmco pursuant to which sb pharmco will supply finished factive product to lg life sciences 
the term of this agreement ends on june  but  subject to the satisfaction of certain requirements  may be extended by lg life sciences to september  we are currently in discussions with new providers of finished products to assume these responsibilities for subsequent periods 
we estimate that it will take to months to qualify a new provider of finished products 
we expect to obtain quantities of factive tablets from sb pharmco that will provide us with sufficient inventory until the new provider can be qualified 
we are also in the process of building a sales and marketing force in order to permit the launch of factive tablets in the second half of since the launch of factive tablets is expected to take place in the second half of  we do not expect sales of factive tablets to have a significant impact on the company s revenues in as a post marketing study commitment  the fda has required a prospective  randomized study comparing factive tablets  patients to an active comparator  patients in patients with cap or abecb 
this study will include patients of different ethnicities  to gain safety information in populations not substantially represented in the existing clinical trial program  specifically as it relates to rash 
patients will be evaluated for clinical and laboratory safety 
this phase iv trial is expected to commence proximate to the product launch in the us our ability to successfully launch factive tablets in the second half of is subject to a number of risks  including the results of the phase iv trial described above  our ability to successfully hire the sales and marketing staff needed for the launch  the ability of our manufacturing partners to timely produce the needed quantities of the drug in compliance with regulations and competition in the marketplace from competing anti infective products 
if we are unable to successfully launch factive tablets in the second half of  our operations  financial position and liquidity would be negatively affected to a significant  and possibly material  degree 
we are also seeking to expand the commercial opportunities for factive through additional development and clinical study plans for the product 
as part of the factive development program  several studies in the acute bacterial sinusitis  or abs  arena were completed 
we are in the process of discussing with the fda activities related to the filing of an nda 
we anticipate filing an nda for this indication in our ability to achieve this goal  however  is subject to a number of risks  including safety risks related to the drug  such as rash  our ability to hire qualified clinical development and regulatory personnel and the possibility that the fda may find that our clinical data fails to establish that the drug is effective or safe to treat this indication 
as a result of these many risks and uncertainties  we can not predict when material cash inflows from our abs program will commence  if ever 
if we fail to meet our goal of filing the nda by  our market for factive will be restricted and this would have a negative impact on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
in addition  we are developing an intravenous formulation of gemifloxacin 
we expect that this intravenous formulation will undergo a phase i bioequivalence study in the coming months 
pending a successful outcome of the first study  we plan to conduct a single phase iii trial of the intravenous formulation before pursuing market approval from the fda 
ramoplanin our ongoing clinical trials and other development activities for ramoplanin have constituted our most significant research and development project comprising of total research and development expenditures for fiscal development activity and associated expense did not commence until the fourth quarter of upon our acquisition of an exclusive license for the product  of total research and development expenditures for fiscal and of total research and development expenditures for fiscal expenses for ramoplanin comprise of the total research and development expense since inception of the project 
in october  we acquired an exclusive license in the united states and canada for a novel antibiotic  ramoplanin  from biosearch italia spa  which merged with versicor inc versicor in march subsequently  versicor changed its name to vicuron pharmaceuticals inc vicuron 
we have assumed responsibility for development of ramoplanin in the united states 
the product candidate is currently in a phase iii clinical trial for the prevention of bloodstream infections caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci vre  as well as a phase ii clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of ramoplanin to treat clostridium difficile associated diarrhea cdad 
our license agreement with vicuron provides us with exclusive rights to develop and market oral ramoplanin in the united states and canada 
vicuron will retain all other rights to market and sell ramoplanin 
in addition  we are obligated to purchase bulk material from vicuron  fund the completion of clinical trials and pay a royalty on product sales 
upon commercialization the combined total of the bulk product purchases and royalties is expected to be approximately of our net product sales 
as of december   the status of the ramoplanin clinical program was as follows in a phase iii clinical trial for the prevention of bloodstream infections caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci vre 
in a phase ii clinical trial to assess safety and efficacy of ramoplanin to treat clostridium difficile associated diarrhea cdad 
in a pilot study to examine ramoplanin s potential role in controlling the spread of nosocomial bacteria 
other supportive clinical trials  chemistry manufacturing controls cmc  and development activity  such as formulation  scale up and validation  required for registration are ongoing or being planned 
the initial goal of the ramoplanin program is to obtain marketing approval from the fda for the vre and cdad indications 
we are also likely to explore programs for other indications to be determined 
the successful commercialization of ramoplanin is subject to many risks and uncertainties  including delays in the progress of our clinical trials  and increased cost  due to the pace of enrollment of patients in the trials  our inability to obtain product approval due to negative  inconclusive or insufficient clinical data and our inability to successfully market our product due to competition from other competing drugs 
as a result of these many risks and uncertainties  we can not predict when material cash inflows from our ramoplanin project will commence  if ever 
a failure to obtain a marketing approval for ramoplanin and to successfully commercialize the drug would have a significant negative impact on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
biopharmaceutical alliances another major research and development focus of ours has been the support we have provided to fulfill our research obligations with our pharmaceutical company partners under our strategic alliances 
the research and development expense to support these alliances was of total research and development expenses in fiscal  of total research and development expenses in fiscal and of total research and development expenses in fiscal research and development expense to support our alliances was of the total research and development expense from january  through december  our first alliance was formed in a summary of the specific biopharmaceutical alliances that have composed our research and development program  including date initiated  alliance goal and status of each alliance  follows biopharmaceutical alliances goal status astrazeneca  august develop pharmaceutical  vaccine and diagnostic products effective against gastrointestinal infections or any other disease caused by helicobacter pylori h 
pylori 
the contract research phase of the alliance concluded in august and the program transitioned into astrazeneca s pipeline 
the program is currently in the lead optimization phase 
schering plough  december identify new gene targets for the development of novel antibiotics utilizing our staphylococcus aureus s 
aureus genomic database 
we completed our research obligations in march and validated drug targets and assays were turned over to schering plough 
schering plough has advanced the program into high throughput screening for drug candidates 
schering plough  december develop new pharmaceuticals for the treatment of asthma through the identification of genes and associated proteins 
in december  we completed our research obligations and schering plough has advanced the program into high throughput screening for drug candidates 
schering plough  september develop new pharmaceutical products to treat fungal infections 
we completed our research obligations in march and validated drug targets and assays were turned over to schering plough 
schering plough has advanced the program into high throughput screening for drug candidates 
biom rieux  september develop  manufacture and sell in vitro pathogen diagnostics products for human clinical and industrial applications 
in november  we completed our contract research obligations under the terms of this agreement 
biopharmaceutical alliances goal status wyeth  december develop drugs based on our genetic research to treat osteoporosis 
in december  we completed our research obligations and wyeth has advanced the program into high throughput screening for drug candidates 
amgen  december identify and develop novel therapeutic agents for bone diseases  including osteoporosis based on our genetic research both companies have agreed to conclude the research collaboration effective april  with the conclusion of this research program  the company will retain certain intellectual property and licensing rights related to its gene discovery under this alliance 
our ability to obtain the goal for each of these alliances is subject to numerous risks  including our inability to realize the potential of our initial discoveries due to scientific failures or lack of skilled personnel 
in addition  we are heavily dependant upon our alliance partners to carry out product discovery  clinical development and commercialization activities 
our success in achieving our goals and obtaining further milestone payments depends  for example  upon whether our alliance partner identifies any compounds  through high throughput screening and lead optimization that warrant clinical development  whether any such compounds demonstrate the required safety and efficacy in clinical trials in order to support a regulatory approval and whether they are able to successfully manufacture and commercialize the product 
due to these uncertainties  we can not be certain if we will obtain additional milestone payments under our alliances or predict when material cash inflows from products generated by these alliances will commence  if ever 
internally funded research program as part of our strategic decision to concentrate on development and commercialization of our own products  we adopted a plan in to substantially reduce our research effort in internally funded early stage target discovery programs 
under this plan  we eliminated full time positions and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in this charge consisted of a reduction in work force  such as severance costs  outplacement services and a non cash charge for the acceleration of vesting of previously granted stock options  as well as impairment charges related to the value of laboratory and computer equipment no longer used in operations 
prior to our strategic shift away from early stage drug discovery  we conducted our own internally funded research programs  falling into two primary categories the discovery and research of potential drug candidates  primarily in the anti infective area 
depending on the potential indication  we sought partners to support further development of our discoveries 
to date  our internal efforts have produced two novel lead series  which have reached the optimization stage 
the acquisition of assets  primarily population resources  combined with our disease gene identification platform with the goal of making discoveries that would facilitate new biopharmaceutical alliances 
as a combined category  these research efforts represented of total research and development expenditures in fiscal  of expenditures in fiscal and of expenditures in fiscal these efforts comprised of the total research and development expense during january  through december  our current portfolio of internal drug discovery programs focuses on bacterial infections and the growing need to develop antibacterial compounds with novel mechanisms of action 
our research program is now focused on the optimization of second generation  orally available pdf inhibitors with the potential to target the broader community based antibiotic market 
several compounds have been identified with improved properties  including good activity against h 
influenzae 
with continued success  we anticipate selecting a development candidate and initiating ind enabling studies 
additionally  as a result of our internal drug discovery efforts  we have identified two novel chemical series ready to enter the lead optimization phase with a partner 
these two lead series are aimed at novel  broad spectrum targets and have the potential to be new classes of antibacterials 
in addition to these lead compounds  we have identified hit series on six additional antimicrobial screens 
our ability to achieve our goals for our internally funded research program is subject to numerous risks  including our inability to make new discoveries due to scientific failures or lack of skilled personnel 
even if we succeed in identifying novel lead series or making genetic discoveries related to a disease  we may not be successful in developing these discoveries further due to lack of internal resources and the inability to find a strategic partner in an increasingly competitive environment for strategic alliances 
due to all of these uncertainties  we can provide no assurance that we will ever receive any material cash inflows from this program 
critical accounting policies estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
our preparation of this report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition biopharmaceutical revenues consist of license fees and contract research and milestone payments from alliances with pharmaceutical companies 
genomics services revenues consist of government grants  fees and royalties received from custom gene sequencing and analysis services and subscription fees from the pathogenome tm database 
revenues from contract research  government grants  and custom gene sequencing and analysis services are recognized over the respective contract periods as the services are performed  provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
the percentage of services performed related to contract research  government grants and custom gene sequencing and analysis services is based on the ratio of the number of direct labor hours performed to date to total direct labor hours the company is obligated to perform under the related contract  as determined on a full time equivalent basis 
revenues from pathogenome tm database subscription fees are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
amounts received for license fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
milestone payments will be recognized upon achievement of the milestone as long as the milestone is non refundable  is deemed to be substantive and the company has no other performance obligations related to the milestone 
unbilled costs and fees represent revenue recognized prior to billing 
deferred revenue represents amounts received prior to revenue recognition 
clinical trial expense accrual our clinical development trials related to ramoplanin are primarily performed by outside parties 
it is not unusual at the end of each accounting period for us to estimate both the total cost and time period of the trials and the percent completed as of that accounting date 
we also adjust these estimates when final invoices are received 
during  we adjusted our accrual for clinical trial expenditures to reflect our most current estimate of liabilities outstanding to outside parties  resulting in a favorable change in estimate in the accrual for clinical development expenditures 
we believe that the estimates that we made as of december  are reflective of the actual expenses incurred as of that date 
however  readers should be cautioned that the possibility exists that the timing or cost of the ramoplanin clinical trials might be longer or shorter and cost more or less than we have estimated and that the associated financial adjustments would be reflected in future periods 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues decreased from  in to  in biopharmaceutical revenues decreased from  in to  in  which reflects primarily lower contract research revenue as a result of the completion last year of our research obligations with schering plough  partially offset by sponsored research revenue and a milestone payment earned from our alliance with amgen  which we entered into in december revenues from genomics services decreased from  in to  in primarily due to the sale of our genomics services business to agencourt in march  as well as the expiration of our government grants with the national human genome research institute to participate in the human genome and mouse rat genome sequencing projects 
revenue from the genomics services business will terminate in upon the expiration of our agreement with agencourt 
there will be a shift in the revenue mix in we expect our revenues derived from both our biopharmaceutical alliances and genomic services to continue to decrease in comparison to prior years and an increase in commercial product revenues as we launch the sale of our factive tablets in the second half of costs and expenses total costs and expenses decreased from  in to  in cost of services decreased from  in to  in due to the sale of the genomics services business to agencourt in march research and development expenses include internal research and development expenses  research funded pursuant to arrangements with our strategic alliance partners  as well as clinical development costs and expenses 
research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel and the cost of materials used in sequencing activities and research and development 
other research and development expenses include fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  information technology and facilities costs 
research and development expenses decreased from  in to  in this decrease was primarily due to i the reduction in our effort in internally funded early stage drug discovery research programs totaling  under our restructuring plan  which was implemented in may  ii the decrease in cost and expenses associated with the decrease in biopharmaceutical revenue of approximately  and iii the reduction in expenses incurred in the clinical development of ramoplanin of approximately  the reduction in clinical development expenses is primarily due to a decrease in expenditures to outside parties of  partially offset by higher support expenditures such as personnel  consulting and material costs of  as part of our effort to reduce costs and expenses  we have substantially reduced our research effort in internally funded early stage target discovery programs 
in connection with the scale back of our activities  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  approximately  was related to a reduction in work force and included severance costs  outplacement services and a non cash charge for the acceleration of vesting of previously granted stock options for employees affected by the initiative 
the restructuring charge also included approximately  of impairment charges related to the value of laboratory and computer equipment no longer used in operations 
during  we also recorded a one time charge to convertible debt retirement expense of  for the early conversion of convertible notes payable issued to two institutional investors in march  which consisted of  for the fair value of the incremental shares issued under the amendment  redemption and exchange agreement dated june  with the investors   for the incremental fair value of the exchange warrants using the black scholes option pricing model  as well as  of unamortized closing costs related to the original agreement with the investors and  of unamortized cost related to the value of the original warrants issued to the investors 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from  in to  in driven principally by the restructuring plan  which resulted in a reduction in support staff and personnel related expenditures  consulting fees and hiring expenses 
our spending patterns will continue to evolve 
we expect the expenses in early stage research to continue to decrease over the year  as we reduce our focus in this arena 
however  in order to realize the commercial launch of factive tablets in the second half of  we will experience a significant increase in hiring as we build a sales and marketing organization  expand the medical development organization to support additional factive development and commercialization  continue support for the development of ramoplanin and build the infrastructure necessary to support these expansions 
other income and expense interest income decreased from  in to  in reflecting lower interest rate yields from investments  as well as a decrease in funds available for investment 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in reflecting lower interest expense incurred this year due to the early retirement of the convertible notes payable  as well as the pay off of an equipment financing arrangement in the first quarter of in  we recorded a gain on the sale of fixed assets of  in  we recorded a gain on the sale of fixed assets of approximately  generated from the sale of certain scientific and computer equipment of approximately  partially offset by a loss on the transfer of fixed assets associated with sale of the genomics services business to agencourt of approximately  other income includes a payment from aventis pasteur for the transfer to aventis of our patent portfolio relating to streptococcus pneumoniae s 
pneumoniae  as well as a realized gain related to the sale of vicuron common stock 
we expect an increase in interest expense in due to the issuance of million of convertible promissory notes to note holders of genesoft in connection with the merger 
the accrued interest is not due until the earlier of i the conversion of the promissory notes into shares of our common stock or ii the maturity date of five years from the closing date of the merger 
years ended december  and revenues total revenues decreased from  in to  in biopharmaceutical revenue decreased from  in to  in primarily due to the absence in of milestone payments that were earned in under our product discovery alliances with schering plough and wyeth 
the decrease in biopharmaceutical revenue also reflects lower sponsored research revenue as a result of the completion of our research obligations under our two anti infective alliances with schering plough in march revenue from genomics services decreased from  in to  in primarily due to lower revenues recognized under our government grants with the national human genome research institute to participate in the human genome and mouse rat genome sequencing projects  as well as lower subscription fees earned under our pathogenome database business as a result of third parties not renewing their database subscriptions 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses increased from  in to  in cost of services decreased from  in to  in primarily due to decreased costs and expenses associated with the above mentioned decrease in genomics services revenue 
the decrease consisted primarily of lower labor and material costs 
research and development expenses include internal research and development  research funded pursuant to arrangements with our strategic alliance partners  as well as clinical development costs and expenses 
research and development expenses increased from  in to  in this planned increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses incurred in the clinical development of ramoplanin of approximately  as well as increased investment in our internal drug discovery programs  specifically in the area of anti infective and chronic human diseases  of  these increases in research and development expenses were partially offset by a decline in research funded under our product discovery alliances of approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in reflecting an expansion in the areas of corporate development and sales and marketing  as well as severance related charges of approximately  associated with our decision to reduce expenditures by eliminating full time staff positions in the areas of early stage research and administration 
interest income and expense interest income decreased from  in to  in reflecting lower interest rate yields from investments  as well as a decrease in funds available for investment 
interest expense increased from  in to  in the increase in interest expense was due to an increase in our outstanding balances under long term obligations from approximately million at december  to million at december  the increase in our long term obligations resulted primarily from the march sale of convertible notes payable in a private placement transaction  which resulted in gross proceeds of million 
interest expense also includes approximately  related to the amortization of deferred issuance costs and warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes payable 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash have been payments received from product discovery alliances  subscription fees  government grants  borrowings under equipment lending facilities and capital leases and proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities 
beginning in  we also anticipate generating cash from the sale of factive tablets following its launch in the second half of this year 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of approximately  on february   subsequent to year end  in conjunction with the merger with genesoft  we sold million shares of our common stock at per share resulting in proceeds received of approximately million  net of issuance costs 
in october  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share resulting in proceeds of approximately million  net of issuance costs 
in connection with this private placement  the company issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
these warrants remain exercisable for a period of five years 
additionally  we sold  shares of common stock to amgen in  a strategic alliance partner  resulting in gross proceeds of approximately in march   we sold convertible notes payable to two institutional investors in a private placement transaction  raising million in gross proceeds 
the investors also received a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
additionally  we are obligated to issue a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to our placement agent in this transaction 
the warrant is exercisable over a three year term which commenced upon the closing of the notes payable transaction 
in june  we entered into an amendment  redemption and exchange agreement with the two institutional investors providing for i the redemption in cash of a portion of the convertible notes due december   ii the conversion of the remaining portion of the convertible notes into our common stock and iii the issuance to the investors of new warrants in exchange for warrants previously held by the investors 
under the terms of the agreement  we redeemed an aggregate of  in principal amount of the convertible notes for a cash payment of  to the investors  and the related accrued and unpaid interest on such principal amount of the convertible notes for a cash payment of an aggregate of  to the investors 
the conversion price of the remaining  in principal amount of the convertible notes was amended to equal per share and the investors converted the remaining amount of the convertible notes  plus related accrued and unpaid interest  into  shares of our common stock 
we also issued new warrants in exchange for the warrants that were previously issued to the investors 
the new warrants have a term of five years from the issuance date  are immediately exercisable and allow the investors to purchase in the aggregate up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the new warrants include provisions for adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise in the event of stock splits  stock dividends  reverse stock splits  and issuances by us of shares of our capital stock at prices below the exercise price or the fair market value of the common stock if higher than such exercise price 
we had also granted the investors a right of participation to purchase up to of the amount of securities sold to investors in non registered or shelf capital raising transactions subject to certain exceptions  provided that if any such transaction exceeds  then for the portion of the transaction that exceeds  the investors have the right to purchase up to of such excess amount sold to investors 
in addition  each investor shall have the right to purchase at least  of securities in any such transaction 
the rights described in this paragraph are effective until the second anniversary of the closing date of the transaction 
we received payments of approximately   and  in  and  respectively  from our product discovery partners consisting of up front license fees  contract research funding  subscription fee  milestone payments and expense reimbursement 
we have various arrangements under which we have financed certain office and laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements 
we had an aggregate of approximately  outstanding under our borrowing arrangements at december  this amount is repayable over the next months  with  repayable over the next months 
under these arrangements  we are required to maintain certain financial ratios  including minimum levels of unrestricted cash 
we had no additional borrowing capacity under these capital lease agreements at december  our operating activities used cash of approximately  in primarily due to our net loss for operations and decreases in accounts payable  clinical trial expense accrual and deferred revenues 
these uses of cash were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable  unbilled costs and fees  prepaid expenses  as well as non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization  restructuring charge  convertible debt retirement expense  and interest expense 
our operating activities used cash of approximately  in primarily due to our net loss from operations and an increase in accounts receivables  unbilled costs and fees as well as a decrease in deferred revenue 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in interest receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets  as well as an increase in accounts payables and accrued liabilities 
our operating activities used cash of approximately  in primarily due to a net loss from operations and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets  as well as a decrease in deferred revenue 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in interest receivable  accounts receivable and unbilled costs and fees  as well as an increase in accounts payables and accrued liabilities 
our investing activities provided cash of approximately   and  in  and  respectively  primarily through the conversion of marketable securities to cash and cash equivalents and proceeds received from sale of property and equipment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as specified in our investment policy guidelines  investments are made primarily in high grade corporate bonds with effective maturities of two years or less  and us government agency securities 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  however  the conservative nature of our investments mitigates our interest rate exposure  and our investment policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  and type of instrument 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is limited
