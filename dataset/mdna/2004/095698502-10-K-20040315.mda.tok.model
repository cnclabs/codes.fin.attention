table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section below in the item entitled risk factors and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
we provide software designed to enable companies to increase revenues by proactively guiding sales people  channel partners and customers through sales interactions 
our revenues are derived from the licensing of our software and the sale of related services 
the license agreement for our software typically provides for an initial fee for use of the software in perpetuity  with use limited by the number of servers cpus  business unit  geographic area  brand or other similar limitations 
service revenues are principally derived from consulting services  maintenance and training 
our maintenance agreements typically are payable in advance  entitle customers to receive software updates  maintenance releases and technical support  and have a one year term 
consulting services and training are generally sold on a time and materials basis 
we market our application suite primarily through a direct sales force 
we also engage in alliances with systems integrators and technology vendors to assist us in marketing and selling our software and related services 
some of our customers use systems integrators to implement our product  and systems integrators are a significant influence in our customers purchasing decisions 
we primarily target our products to customers competing in the commercial and consumer markets 
while the majority of our revenues to date have been derived from customers in the united states  international revenues accounted for of our revenues for and  and for we believe that international revenues will fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in the near term 
our quarterly operating results have experienced seasonal fluctuations in the past 
quarterly results fluctuate based on several factors  including our customers fiscal years  budgeting cycles  sales incentive plans  slow summer purchasing patterns and general economic conditions in markets where we conduct business 
to date  we have derived a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers 
in  two customers each accounted for more than of consolidated revenues 
no single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues for or we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our quarterly total revenues 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of total revenues in  of revenues in and of revenues in the loss of a major potential or existing customer or the delay or cancellation of anticipated significant license contracts would adversely affect our revenues and operating results in a particular quarter 
failure to obtain a significant number of new customers or additional orders from existing customers in any period would adversely affect our business and operating results 
our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations of future revenues over the long term  and are largely fixed in the short term 
as such  a delay in completion of new customer license contracts or the recognition of revenues from one or more license contracts could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in significant variation in our quarterly results of operations 
overview of marked an improvement for blue martini software  in that our license revenues increased significantly and our net loss decreased as compared to we nearly doubled our license revenues to million in from million in we increased the total number of customers that have licensed our software from companies as of december  to over companies as of december  we leveraged our e commerce heritage to reposition ourselves as a leading provider of intelligent selling systems  systems that are designed to enable companies to sell more 
we implemented a new go to market strategy  allowing us to reach decision making executives of potential customers 
we improved our relationships with our partners  resulting in more significant joint customer wins than in 
table of contents despite these improvements  the weak global economy adversely affected our operating performance during throughout much of  and  economic conditions in the united states and other countries we operated in either deteriorated or stabilized at depressed levels 
further  political uncertainties  including hostilities involving the united states  increased corporations general cautiousness in setting their capital spending budgets 
these uncertain and weak economic conditions greatly impacted the information technology industry 
many corporations have increased efforts to identify and realize potential cost savings in these difficult economic times  and as a result  have delayed their information technology spending 
in addition  many companies have curtailed their information technology spending due to past capital expenditures anticipating growth that did not materialize 
these factors negatively affected our operations and financial performance 
many of our customers and potential customers have delayed initiating the purchasing process  increased evaluation time to complete a software purchase and reduced their capital expenditure budgets 
we believe that our greatest challenges as a company are to close sales transactions more expeditiously  and to increase our sales pipeline 
during  our ability to sell was harmed by turnover in the leadership and staffing of our sales force 
in  we need to communicate better to our potential customers the immediate value we believe our solutions offer  we need to provide potential customers with a clear path to achieve that potential value  and we must grow our relationships with consulting and system integrator partners 
we also need to increase our sales force productivity and ensure that new members of our sales team become productive within a reasonable period 
we also strive to improve our overall performance by strengthening our competitive position  controlling costs  effectively managing our cash flow and better aligning our management and organizational structure to support our sales efforts 
the results of operations section below discusses our results in more detail 
results of operations revenues license change change to to license revenue in thousands percentage of total revenues the increase in license revenues in dollar terms in as compared to was due to an increase in average size of license transactions per customer 
our average size of license transactions per customer more than doubled  from approximately  in to approximately  in in  we added new customers  comparable with the number of new customers added in the increased size of license transactions per customer in compared to is a result of our segment and vertical focus  our point solution selling strategy  and improved relationships with our business partners 
the decrease in license revenues in as compared to was due to a decrease in average size and number of license transactions due in part to the overall global and business conditions that adversely impacted information technology spending  particularly by companies in our target markets 
our business is affected by the economic and business conditions of these target markets and the level of demand for information technology within these industries  resulting in an increase in the average length of our sales cycles  a marked increase in competitive pricing pressure and a decrease in the average revenues derived from license transactions as well as in the total number of such license transactions in compared to in addition  we began offering software products acquired from the cybrant acquisition in the second quarter of because our professional services related to these arrangements were deemed essential to the functionality of the software  we initially accounted for license revenues from the cybrant software products using the percentage 
table of contents of completion method under statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in the fourth quarter of  upon repeated successful implementations of the cybrant application  we determined that our professional services were not essential to the functionality of the software  and as such  in the fourth quarter of  we began to recognize license transactions relating to the cybrant software products upon delivery  instead of using the percentage of completion method  subject to meeting all other revenue recognition criteria 
although marked an improvement in our license revenues  customers in our target markets remained cautious with respect to their capital spending 
we expect these conditions to persist in the foreseeable future  for that reason  we have adopted strategies that we believe will allow us to maintain or improve our results even if the economic recovery is slow or delayed 
we are committed to improving the performance of our sales operations and continuing to increase our license revenues in to support our sales efforts  we have eliminated certain positions to create an efficient and effective sales organization and are making changes in both our sales and marketing organizations to achieve a consistent increase of the sales pipeline  consistent increase of pipeline to license conversion rates  higher average selling prices  and shorter time frame for new members of our sales force to become productive 
these changes will include new sales training programs  better selling methodology and a more targeted approach to partnering  as well as new sales and marketing leadership 
service change change to to service revenue in thousands percentage of total revenues service revenues include revenues from consulting professional services  technical support maintenance and to a lesser extent training activities 
in absolute dollar terms  services revenues decreased in from primarily as a result of driving consulting services to our partners 
our maintenance revenues in were comparable with the decrease in service revenues in dollar terms in compared to was due primarily to reductions in both our maintenance revenues and our consulting service engagements 
the reduction in maintenance revenue in was primarily a result of a decrease in new license revenues and a decrease in renewal rates from our existing customer base as customers continued to manage their costs 
the reduction in consulting revenues was primarily due to a decrease in the scope and the size of service engagements resulting from an overall reduction in license activities 
we expect our service revenues  in dollar terms  to grow in at a lower rate than the growth in license revenues 

table of contents cost of revenues license change change to to cost of license in thousands percentage of total revenues cost of license revenues generally consists of royalty payments to third parties  amortization of prepaid royalties and amortization of purchased intangible assets for technology that is either embedded in or bundled with our software 
cost of license revenues for includes amortization of intangible assets acquired in the cybrant acquisition as well as accelerated amortization totaling  related to technology rights in the form of prepaid royalties for which we reduced the estimated useful lives 
cost of license revenues represented of license revenues in  in and in the decrease in costs of license revenues in dollar terms in from was due to the decrease in the amortization of purchased intangible assets as we wrote off the majority of these assets as part of the impairment evaluation in see impairment discussion below under the heading impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
the decrease in costs of license revenues in dollar terms in from was due to the reduction in royalties expense arising from the reduction in license revenues  which was partially offset by the assets we wrote off as part of the impairment evaluation in as of december   all purchased technologies have been fully amortized 
accordingly  based on agreements currently in place  we expect the cost of license revenues in to be comprised of a fixed amount of  per quarter and a variable amount estimated to be between and of license revenues for payments required under technology license arrangements 
service change change to to cost of service in thousands percentage of total revenues cost of service revenues consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  costs of services provided by third party subcontractors engaged by us  allocated overhead costs  and depreciation of equipment used to provide consulting services  technical support and training 
allocated overhead costs for costs of services and other expense categories include facilities  information systems  and other corporate infrastructure costs 
cost of service revenues represented  and of service revenues for  and  respectively 
the decrease in from the and the decrease in from resulted primarily from reductions in force and other cost saving actions implemented in these periods 
in addition  in  as part of the allocation of the total credit of million arising from the expiration of a potential reimbursement obligation related to a prior executive officer  we recorded a credit of  see note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion 
because our cost of service revenues are relatively fixed  our cost of services  when expressed as a percentage of related service revenues  may fluctuate in the near term  based primarily on our related service revenues 

table of contents operating expenses sales and marketing change change to to sales and marketing in thousands percentage of total revenues headcount sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  and other personnel related expenses associated with our direct sales and marketing personnel  allocated overhead costs  and costs of marketing programs including trade shows  advertisements  promotional activities and media events 
the and expense also included amortization of deferred marketing costs of million and million  respectively  related to warrants issued to a system integrator 
the decreases in from and in from were due primarily to the reduction in the deferred marketing amortization expense  lower spending on marketing and advertising programs and lower personnel related expenses resulting from reductions in force and other cost saving actions 
further  in  as part of the total credit of million arising from the expiration of a potential reimbursement obligation related to a prior executive officer  we recorded a credit of  see note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion 
in addition  the unamortized balance of deferred marketing costs of  was written off as part of the impairment evaluation in we expect that sales and marketing expenses in will increase from reflecting additional variable costs related as we commit to improve our sales operations and continue to increase our license revenues 
research and development change change to to research and development in thousands percentage of total revenues headcount research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses for engineering personnel  allocated overhead costs  costs of contractors  and depreciation of equipment used in the development of our software products 
development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized  subject to recoverability 
to date  all costs related to the development of our software have been expensed as incurred 
the decrease in from was primarily due to the decrease in average headcount in to compared to in and a credit of  arising from the expiration of a potential reimbursement obligation related to a prior executive officer in the credit of  is an allocation to research and development of the million credit  which is discussed in further detail in note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the decrease in from was primarily due to decreases in personnel related expenses resulting from reductions in force  which started in and continued in and a credit of  arising from a joint research and development effort with an alliance partner in we expect that research and development expenses in will be at a level similar to as we continue to enhance our suite of applications while at the same time manage our cost structure 

table of contents general and administrative change change to to general and administrative in thousands percentage of total revenues headcount general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our finance  human resources  legal  and other administrative functions 
these costs consist principally of salaries and other personnel related expenses  professional fees  provision for doubtful accounts  equipment depreciation  and allocated overhead costs 
the decreases in from and were primarily due to the reductions in force  a credit of  arising from the expiration of a potential reimbursement obligation related to a prior executive officer and other cost saving actions  which started in and continued in and the credit of  is an allocation to general and administrative of the million total credit  which is discussed further in note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we expect that general and administrative expenses in will be at a level similar to stock based compensation stock based compensation in thousands stock based compensation consists of the net amortization of deferred stock compensation relating to stock options that vest over time and the stock based compensation expense associated with immediately vested stock options and warrants granted to non employees 
deferred stock compensation represented the difference between the exercise price of stock option grants to employees and the deemed fair market value of our common stock at the time of grant 
deferred stock based compensation was amortized to expense over the period during which the common stock and stock options vest using an accelerated method allowed by generally accepted accounting principles 
the reported expense is net of adjustment for accelerated deferred stock compensation amortization previously recognized for terminated employees 
at december   the deferred stock compensation balance had been fully amortized 
we recorded deferred stock compensation of  and  in and  respectively  using the intrinsic value method  which is based on the difference between the exercise price of stock option grants to employees and the deemed fair market value of our common stock at the time of grant 
we did not record any deferred stock compensation in in  we granted immediately vested stock options and warrants to certain non employees resulting in charges of  which were valued based on the black scholes option pricing model 
deferred stock compensation expense in included a charge of  for the variable plan accounting associated with a stock option exchange program initiated in  under which  outstanding employee stock options with exercise prices at or above per share approximately of the total eligible options were exchanged for replacement stock options at the fair market value of per share  which vested over a five month period ending in may and expired in september the charge reflected the net increase in our stock market price above the option exercise price through the date the underlying options were exercised or expired 
as of december   there were no variable stock awards outstanding and we expect no further variable plan award expenses in the near future 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
in september  a sharp decline in our stock price resulted in our market capitalization being significantly below our net asset value 
we determined that this circumstance triggered a review of our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  we performed an impairment analysis of our property and equipment  intangible assets and other long lived assets  other than 
table of contents goodwill  and determined that the carrying amount of property and equipment  intangible assets and other long lived assets exceeded their respective fair values 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
the remaining balances in property and equipment and acquisition related technology and intangibles are depreciated and amortized  respectively  over their remaining estimated lives  mostly through the end of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment if a sfas no 
triggering event has occurred 
accordingly  we performed an impairment analysis of goodwill arising from the cybrant acquisition 
as we have determined that we operate in a single segment with one reporting unit  the fair value of our reporting unit was determined based on our market capitalization on the date of the impairment testing 
as a result of this analysis  we wrote off all million of goodwill in we estimated the fair value of our long lived assets based on a combination of the market  income and replacement cost approaches 
in the application of the impairment testing  we were required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates 
the impairment charge to goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets from the impairment review resulted in a write off of the net book value as follows in thousands goodwill acquisition related technology other intangible assets property and equipment total further  in september  we recorded a benefit of  representing purchase price adjustments resulting from the final resolution of acquisition related costs  acquired liabilities and the retirement of shares held in escrow relating to the cybrant acquisition 
in process research and development 
approximately  of the purchase price in the cybrant acquisition in april represented the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was charged to expense upon the acquisition date 
the value assigned to purchased in process research and development comprises development projects that were labeled at the acquisition time as versions and of the cybrant product that were valued by employment of a discounted cash flow model using discount rate of 
version was commercialized in  version was commercialized in restructuring charges restructuring charges in thousands decrease in headcount during  and  we implemented restructuring plans intended to strengthen our future operating performance and competitive position by preserving cash and reducing costs 
as part of these restructurings  we reduced our employee force by approximately employees in  employees in and approximately employees in some of the restructuring actions also included vacating excess facilities 
these actions resulted in net restructuring charges of  in  million in and million in 
table of contents as of december   the company has accrued restructuring charges of million related to excess facilities  which will be paid through these accrued charges reflect estimates with respect to the time it will take to sublease the facilities  sublease terms  and sublease rates 
should there be changes in real estate market conditions or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the remaining vacant facilities  adjustments to the idle facilities lease losses reserve may be necessary in future periods based upon then current actual events and circumstances 
the following tables summarize the activity related to restructuring activities in and in thousands accrued at december  total expense non cash charges cash payments accrued at december  lease cancellations idle facility severance and related charges accrued at december  total expense non cash charges cash payments accrued at december  lease cancellations idle facility severance and related charges interest income and other  net interest income and other  net consists of interest income from cash  cash equivalents and short term investments partially offset by interest expense associated with capital leases and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
interest income and other  net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decline in interest income in the three years from to was primarily due to lower interest rates and the decline in balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
foreign currency transaction losses were immaterial in and and approximately  in we expect interest income to decrease as the amount of cash and cash equivalents available for investment decreases as cash is used in operations and as prevailing interest rates remain low 
income taxes from inception to december   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any tax provision or benefit 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal and million of california state net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through the california net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through because of our limited operating history  our losses incurred to date and the difficulty in forecasting our future results  management does not believe that the realization of the related deferred income tax asset is more likely than not 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax assets

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
we incurred net losses in each quarter since inception and may continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future 
no conclusions about our future results should be drawn based on the results of our operations for any quarter  as quarterly results are not indicative of the results for a full fiscal year or any other period 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash and cash equivalents and short term investments working capital stockholders equity as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  down from million as of december  our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds  commercial paper and us treasury and government agency securities 
all of our investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value based on quoted market prices in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
during  net cash used in operating activities was million compared to million in and million in the decreases in net cash used in operating activities in from and in from were due primarily to the decrease in our net losses in each of the years resulting from extensive headcount reductions and other cost saving actions 
these reductions in net losses were partially offset by the reduction of non cash charges such as depreciation  amortization of deferred stock compensation  restructuring and impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
our accounts receivables decreased in as we proactively managed collections of outstanding balances 
our days sales outstanding in  and were  and days  respectively  reflecting our efforts 
net cash provided by investing activities were million in and million in  principally related to the net sale of short term investments partially offset by fixed asset purchases 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  related to the net sale of short term investments  partially offset by purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets 
we do not expect any major capital expenditures in the near future 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  resulting from proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
in  net cash used in financing activities was  consisting of repayments of debt and capital lease obligations offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
most of the proceeds from the stock options exercises were related to options from the stock option exchange program instituted in december that expired in september see discussion in note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
cash provided by financing activities was million in and principally related to the net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
depending on the level of employee stock option and purchase activity and the prevailing market price for our stock  net cash provided by or used in financing activities may vary in the near term 
in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of our outstanding common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased and retired approximately  shares of our common stock in open market transactions at prevailing market prices for a total cost of approximately  including commissions 
if we repurchase our outstanding common stock  additional cash will be used 
based on current conditions  we do not anticipate repurchasing additional shares under this program in the near term 
we expect that for the foreseeable future  our operating costs and expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may use our cash resources to fund acquisitions or invest in other businesses  technologies or product lines 
we currently anticipate that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated operating requirements for at least the next months 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that this additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on reasonable terms and not dilutive to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we could have to accept financing on terms we viewed as unreasonable or that were dilutive to our stockholders  or to pursue alternative options  such as seeking a merger or acquisition  or in the worst case  winding down our operations 
if we were to seek additional financing today  we do not believe it would be available on reasonable terms 

table of contents the existence or even the anticipation of an uncertain economic environment by potential customers in the markets in which we operate has affected the demand for our applications  caused pricing pressures for our products  increased customer requests for extended payment terms  and impacted our sales activity during  and  and may continue to do so in future periods  which could in turn affect our liquidity 
commitments our principal commitments as of december  consisted of obligations under operating leases  letter of credit agreements  and royalty agreements 
we expect to fulfill our commitments through our working capital 
letters of credit 
at december    of cash equivalents is held in trust as security for a letter of credit for guarantee of lease payments for leased office space 
such cash equivalents will be restricted until the expiration of the lease term in royalties 
we license and incorporate into our products technologies from third party software providers

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts and accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements 
we have identified the following as critical estimates employed in applying critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we allocate revenue on software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the residual method prescribed by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe for all undelivered elements in the arrangement and the residual value is allocated to the license 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element  including maintenance  to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
vsoe for maintenance is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates 

table of contents we identified two critical accounting estimates with respect to applying our revenue recognition policy in and in the near future 
the first critical accounting estimate relate to determining whether an option provided to the customer to purchase specified software products in the future represents an element of the present arrangement or is a separate arrangement 
we evaluate whether these options provide the customer with significant incremental discounts to the optional software 
we primarily consider the discount of the optional products relative to the discount of the delivered software products and the price paid by other customers for the same software in similar configurations  however  there is judgment involved in determining whether discounted prices on the optional software are incremental and significant 
in cases where the optional software is discounted at a higher rate than the delivered element  we defer some of the revenue related to the delivered element and recognize the deferred revenue when the optional software is delivered or when the option expires 
to date  we did not have to defer any such revenues 
the second critical accounting estimate with respect to our revenue recognition policy related to estimating percentage of completion for certain services transactions that require such estimation 
we review each transaction at quarter end and apply an estimate of percentage of completion to the contract amount to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
we calculate the percentage based on contractual milestones met or  when the contract does not involve milestones  on hours incurred relative to total estimated hours to complete a project 
we evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates based on the type of services we render and our overall role in a project 
in cases where the percentage of completion method is appropriate  the license revenue will be deferred and recognized based on the percentage completion of the project 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
accounts receivable is recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance and sales return reserve by considering the accounts receivable aging  customer concentrations  the customer s expected ability to pay  our collection history with each customer  available information regarding customer satisfaction and current economic trends 
we review any outstanding past due balances to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors discussed above 
in addition  we maintain a general allowance for doubtful accounts for all invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and the realization reserve represent our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowance or reserve in the future 
accrued liabilities 
the idle facility lease losses were based on our lease commitments offset by our best estimate expected sublease income and related costs 
these estimates are based upon management s estimate of the time required to sublet the facility and the amount of sublease income that will be generated once the facility is sublet 
should there be changes in real estate market conditions or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the remaining vacant facilities  adjustments to the idle facilities lease losses reserve may be necessary in future periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  we adopted the provision of sfas no 
as of july  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition  which codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab no 
 revenue recognition  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the changes noted in sab no 
did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents factors that may impact future operating results risks related to our financial condition we have incurred losses throughout our operating history 
these losses may continue for the foreseeable future  and we may not achieve profitability 
in  we incurred net losses of million  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur losses on both a quarterly and annual basis  and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
moreover  we expect to continue to incur significant costs of services and substantial operating expenses 
therefore  we will need to significantly increase our revenues to achieve and maintain profitability and a positive cash flow 
we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
our declining cash balance and volatile stock price have affected our potential and current customers and partners perception of our viability  which in turn could affect our ability to close sales and partnership transactions 
concerns about our perceived financial viability were a factor in multiple potential and actual customer transactions and partner relationships during and and to a lesser extent in we attribute these concerns primarily to the following we are not yet profitable and thus must use our cash balance offset by revenues to fund our operations  our stock price experienced a dramatic decline from to  our stock price has been  and continues to be  volatile  and many of our competitors are better funded  more established  or significantly larger than we are 
we will continue to use our cash balance offset by revenues to fund our operations until we achieve profitability which may not occur  thus  we expect our cash balance will continue to decline during therefore  if these conditions do not improve significantly in the next year  we expect these concerns about our perceived viability to continue 
risks related to our products if we fail to keep pace with technological innovation  improve our existing products  or develop new products  our application suite could become obsolete and our revenues would decline 
the market for our application suite is marked by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  internet related technology enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in client demands and evolving industry standards 
new products based on new technologies or new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
to succeed  we will need to enhance our current application suite and develop new products on a timely basis to keep pace with developments related to internet technology and to satisfy the increasingly sophisticated requirements of our clients 
enterprise application software technology is complex  and new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods  we cannot be certain that we will successfully develop and market new products  new product enhancements or new products compliant with present or emerging internet technology standards 
our future revenues will depend  in significant part  on our ability to successfully develop and license new and enhanced versions of our application suite  and our ability to continue diversifying our offerings by developing and licensing new products 
if we are not able to successfully improve our existing products and develop new products  or if we develop new products and they do not achieve market acceptance  or if we were to experience delays in either  our revenues are likely to decline 
if we fail to release new versions and upgrades of our application suite in a timely manner  customers may license competing products and our revenues may decline 
we may fail to introduce or deliver new products on a timely basis  if at all 
in the past  we have experienced delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of enhancements to our application suite 
to date  these delays have not had a material impact on our revenues 
if we are unable to ship or implement new products or enhancements to our application suite when planned or at all  or fail to achieve timely market acceptance of these new products or enhancements  we may suffer lost sales and thus reduce our revenues 
our future operating results will depend on demand for our application suite  including new and enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced 
if our application suite does not successfully function for customers with large numbers of transactions  customers or product offerings  we may lose sales and suffer decreased revenues 
our application suite must be 
table of contents able to accommodate a large number of transactions  customers and product offerings 
large scale usage presents significant technical challenges that are difficult or impossible to predict 
to date  our application suite has been deployed on a large scale by only a limited number of customers and  therefore  we can make no assurances that our application suite is able to meet our customers demands for large scale usage 
if our customers experience difficulty with our application suite during periods of high traffic or usage  the reputation of our products would suffer and our revenues would be likely to decline accordingly 
our interactive selling application may not be capable of handling our customers needs 
our interactive selling system is based on a powerful configuration engine that has proven successful for a number of customers 
nonetheless  it is possible that our system could fail to successfully meet a customer s needs if the customer s configuration requirements are extremely complex  exceptionally broad in scope  or not fully understood by us 
loss or inability of key technologies licensed to us by third parties could affect our ability to license our product 
our products incorporate technologies licensed from third party software providers 
in particular  we license array database modeling and configuration technology from array technology a s  and we license a rules engine from blaze software inc that automates the execution of business processes according to criteria set by our customers 
we may not be able to maintain or renew our license agreements for these technologies on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
the loss of these technologies could harm our ability to license our products and increase our costs until we identify or develop substitute technologies  license them  and integrate them into our product  even if substitute technologies are available  we may not be able to license those technologies on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
if our product does not operate with the wide variety of hardware  software and operating systems used by our current and potential customers  our revenues would be harmed 
we currently serve a customer base that uses a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  software applications and operating systems 
our application suite will gain broad market acceptance only if it can support a wide variety of hardware  software applications  systems  and standards  including those developed in the future 
defects in our application suite could diminish demand for our application suite and result in loss of revenues  decreased market acceptance  injury to our reputation and product liability claims 
as is not unusual for software companies  we have in the past discovered software errors and performance problems with various versions of our application suite after release  and  as a result  have experienced injury to our reputation  increased expenses  delays in the shipment of our application suite and our customers have experienced difficulty in deploying and operating our application suite 
errors in our application suite may be caused by defects in third party software incorporated into our application suite 
if so  we may not be able to fix these defects without the cooperation of these software providers 
since these defects may not be as significant to our software providers as they are to us  we may not receive the rapid cooperation that we may require 
we may not have the contractual right to access the source code of third party software and  even if we access the source code  we may not be able to fix the defect 
since our customers use our application suite for critical business applications such as e commerce  any errors  defects or other performance problems of our application suite could damage our customers businesses 
consequently  these customers could delay or withhold payment to us for our software and services  which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable 
in addition  these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  a product liability claim brought against us would likely be time consuming and costly and harm our reputation  and thus our ability to license to new customers 
even if a suit is not brought  correcting errors in our application suite could increase our expenses 
a customer suit is pending against us alleging that our products failed to perform as represented 
the company believes that it has meritorious defenses against these allegations and intends to defend itself vigorously 
see part i  item  legal proceedings 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or become subject to intellectual property infringement claims  we may lose a valuable asset or incur costly and time consuming litigation 
our success depends in part on the development and protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely primarily on a 
table of contents combination of trade secret  copyright  trademark  and patent laws  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights and technology  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain the source code to our software or use other information that we regard as proprietary or could develop software competitive to ours 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our product 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we have one issued patent and several pending patent applications 
it is possible that some of the patents that we have applied for will not be issued  and even if issued  that some or all may be successfully challenged 
it is also possible that we may not develop additional proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any patent issued to us may fail to provide us with competitive advantage  and that the patents of others may materially harm our ability to do business 
in the future  a third party may bring suit claiming that our current or future products infringe its patents  trade secrets or copyrights 
any claims  with or without merit  could be costly and time consuming to defend  divert our management s attention  or cause product delays 
we have only one currently issued patent that we could use defensively against any company bringing such a claim 
if our product was found to infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to be able to sell our product 
royalty and licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all  which could materially harm our business 
risks related to our market and our ability to sell the current economic downturn has significantly affected demand for our products and services and may continue to adversely impact future revenues 
the existence of economic downturns in the markets in which we operate has decreased the demand for our applications  caused pricing pressures for our products  and affected our sales activity during  and in  we signed new license contracts  a decrease from new license contracts signed in  in  we signed new license contracts  a further decrease from  and in  we signed new license contracts  comparable to due in part to the macroeconomic conditions during  and  customers reduced their information technology budgets and postponed or cancelled planned projects  including the evaluation and purchase of new applications  upgrades to existing applications  and purchase of related services 
as a result  our revenues have been negatively impacted  and may continue to be in the future 
the existence or even the anticipation of an uncertain economic environment by potential customers in the markets in which we operate affected the demand for our applications  caused pricing pressures for our products  increased customer request for extended payment terms  substantially reduced our sales activity during and  and continued to affect sales in we expect it will continue to do so in future periods  which could in turn materially reduce our liquidity 
in addition  ongoing financial  political  economic  and other uncertainties have further weakened the global economy 
additional terrorist attacks  continued war or increased outsourcing of technology projects overseas could adversely affect our business  including revenues  financial condition  and results of operations 
our budgeting and forecasting depend on estimates of revenue growth in our target markets 
thus  the prevailing economic and political uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate anticipated license contract signings and future revenues 
the future performance of the overall domestic and global economies and the resolution of current international tension involving the united states will likely have a significant impact on our overall performance 
to the extent that the current downturn continues or increases in severity or scope  we believe demand for our products and services  and therefore future revenues  could be further reduced 
we may not be able compete effectively with current and potential competitors 
we compete in the highly competitive crm market  which is subject to rapid technological change 
we believe that our products  which are externally focused on increasing our customers sales to their own customers  are fundamentally different from traditional crm offerings  which focus internally on managing and reporting a customer s sales efforts and 
table of contents opportunities 
we may not be able to articulate the value we believe we offer with sufficient clarity and distinctiveness to generate interest in our target markets 
a principal source of competition is the internal information technology departments at potential customers  which may develop systems that provide for some or all of the functionality of our applications 
our products also compete with products  components  or solutions offered by art technology group  inc  broadvision  inc  e 
phipany  inc  firepond  inc  microsoft corporation  oracle corp  peoplesoft  inc  sap ag  selectica  inc  siebel systems  inc  trilogy software  inc  unica corporation and vignette corporation 
compared to us  many of these competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial resources 
this may place us at a disadvantage in responding to our competitors pricing strategies  technological advances  advertising campaigns  strategic partnerships and other initiatives 
competitive pressures and our perceived viability in this market may make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers  and may require us to reduce the price of our products which could reduce our revenues and result in increased operating losses 
the sales cycle for our products is long and variable  which makes it difficult to predict our future revenues and may cause our operating results to vary significantly 
our revenues and results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
for example  certain indicators that we relied upon in developing our license revenue forecasts  such as our historical pattern of transaction timing and anticipated sales cycles  did not prove reliable during  or during these periods  we continued to see extended sales cycles  our average sales period was six to twelve months in   and the period between initial contact with a prospective customer and the licensing of our application suite varies and can range from three to more than twelve months 
because of this variable sales cycle  the timing of revenues from the licensing of our application suite is difficult to forecast 
factors affecting our sales cycle  many of which are beyond our control  include many of our license agreements close within the last few weeks of each quarter  customers consider a number of factors related to our products and services  as well as our financial condition  before committing to purchase our application suite 
as a result  we spend significant time and resources informing prospective customers about our company  application suite  and other offerings  which may not result in a completed transaction but may nonetheless impact our operating margins  the licensing of our application suite is often an enterprise wide decision by our customers that involves many factors and decision makers  thus  if our customer s management  budget  or strategy changes  our ability to conclude license agreements may be affected  because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenues are derived from a small number of customers  delays in the signing of one or more large license agreements or the loss of a significant customer order may materially affect revenues and our operating results  due in part to macroeconomic conditions  customers remain cautious about spending  and have increased requests for contract terms that affect our ability to recognize revenue 
these conditions may persist in the future  customer approval processes are unpredictable  delays in approvals  even after selection of a vendor  could impact the timing and amount of revenues recognized in a quarterly period  we have recently changed several aspects of our sales leadership  strategy and process with the intention of improving our sales pipeline and results  including changes in the way we generate leads  hiring of additional salespeople and changes in the way we target and approach accounts 
we expect that it may take up to twelve months to see positive results from these changes  although these changes may not show positive results during that period or at all 
as a result of these changes  our ability to market and license our software may be limited accordingly  and the number  timing and significance of enhancements to our application suite  and the introduction by us or our competitors  of new software may affect customers purchasing decisions 
because of this variation in sales cycle length  it is difficult for us to predict revenues and thus our operating results could be hard to estimate 
for example  if our license results do not meet our internal expectations  our service offerings would be affected since service revenues lag licenses and our services revenues would be reduced  which would harm our overall results since service expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 

table of contents a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues  and this pattern is likely to continue for the foreseeable future  as a result  our revenues could decline due to the loss or delay of a single customer order  the delay in recognizing revenue associated with a single customer order  or the failure to collect revenue associated with a single customer 
each quarter during our operating history  a relatively small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of that quarter s total revenues 
we expect this to continue in the future 
thus  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues and operating results 
the timing of recognition of customer revenue may also affect our results 
customer payments that do not meet our revenue recognition policy requirements are recorded as deferred revenue 
although new agreements may not result in revenues in the quarter in which the agreement was signed  commissions and royalties may nonetheless become payable on such agreements during that quarter  which would impact our operating results 
we may not successfully establish ourselves in international markets or generate significant revenues abroad  which could result in slower revenue growth and harm our business 
in  we generated approximately of our total revenues from sales outside the united states 
we have sales offices in  france  japan  netherlands  and the united kingdom  and have also generated sales in other countries 
we may add others in the future 
if we are not successful in continuing to license our application suite in international markets  or if we do not increase sales from outside the united states  we could experience slower revenue growth and our business could be harmed 
we anticipate devoting additional resources and management attention to expanding international opportunities 
our international expansion carries with it a number of additional challenges  including greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  expenses associated with foreign operations and compliance with applicable laws  difficulty and costs of managing a global technical support service that provides around the clock support  political or economic changes or instability in a specific country or region  expenses associated with localizing our product for foreign countries  differing intellectual property rights and the enforcement of such rights  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  different sales cycles and collection periods or seasonal reductions in business activity  multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  and foreign currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations 
increasing government regulation of personal data  the internet  imposition of sales and other taxes on products sold by our customers over the internet and privacy concerns could reduce the license of our application suite and harm our business 
federal  state or foreign agencies may adopt laws or regulations affecting personal data or the use of the internet as a commercial medium 
we expect that laws and regulations relating to user privacy  pricing  content and quality of products and services could indirectly affect our business 
current federal legislation limits the imposition of state and local taxes on internet related sales at this time 
congress may choose not to renew this legislation  in which case state and local governments would be free to impose taxes on electronically purchased goods 
the imposition of new sales or other taxes could limit the growth of internet commerce in general and  as a result  the demand for our application suite and services 
businesses use our application suite to capture information regarding their customers when those customers contact them on line with customer service inquiries 
privacy concerns may cause visitors to withhold personal data  which would limit the effectiveness of our application suite 
more importantly  even the perception of privacy concerns  whether or not valid  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our application suite 
risks related to system integrators our failure to develop and maintain strong relationships with consulting and system integrator firms csis would harm our ability to market our application suite  which could reduce future revenues and increase our expenses 
an increasing portion of our sales are influenced by the recommendation of our application suite by systems integrators  consulting firms and other third parties that help deploy our application suite for our customers 

table of contents losing the support of these third parties may limit our ability to penetrate our existing or potential markets 
these third parties are under no obligation to recommend or support our application suite and could recommend or give higher priority to their own products and services or those of other companies 
our inability to gain the support of csis or a shift by these companies toward favoring competing products could negatively affect our software license and service revenues 
some csis also engage in joint marketing and sales efforts with us 
if our relationships with these csis fail  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing of our application suite 
in many cases  these parties have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and influence the decisions of these customers 
a number of our competitors have longer and more established relationships with these csis than we do  and as a result those csis may be more likely to recommend competitors products and services and increase our expenses 
our failure to develop and maintain strong relationships with systems integrators would harm our ability to implement our application suite 
systems integrators assist our customers with the installation and deployment of our application suite  in addition to those products of our competitors  and perform custom integration of computer systems and software 
if we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with systems integrators  we would be required to hire additional personnel to install and maintain our application suite  which would result in higher expenses and delays in our ability to recognize revenue 
other risks changes in accounting policies created and interpreted by authoritative agencies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
our accounting policies that may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows revenue recognition accounting for business combinations stock based compensation goodwill and other intangible assets accounting changes to these or other rules or the questioning of current practices may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business 
see the discussion under use of estimates and critical accounting policies in thus annual report for additional information about our critical accounting policies and some risks associated with these policies 
we may have difficulty retaining or recruiting qualified personnel  which could impact the development and license of our application suite 
difficulty in hiring or retaining qualified personnel  or failure by newly hired personnel to develop necessary skills or reach expected levels of productivity  may weaken our ability to develop and market our application suite 
our success also depends on the continued contributions of key engineering  sales and marketing  management  and professional services personnel 
in particular  losing the services of monte zweben  our chairman and chief executive officer  would be difficult to replace 
our ability to increase our sales will depend on our ability to recruit  train and retain top quality sales people who can target prospective customers senior management and generate and service large accounts 
in our industry  competition for qualified sales personnel is intense 
our chairman and ceo maintains significant control over blue martini software  which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate strategy and other issues 
our directors  executive officers  and holders of or more of our outstanding common stock owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  monte zweben  our chairman and chief executive officer  together with related entities  owned approximately of our common stock as of this date 
these stockholders  acting together  and mr 
zweben  
table of contents individually  will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combination transactions 
this control may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that could discourage or prevent a takeover 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
these provisions include establishment of a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board may be elected at one time  authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent and requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporations law and the terms of our stock option plans may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange through december   approximately of our revenues were denominated in united states dollars and were primarily from customers in the united states and canada  and approximately of our revenues were in various international currencies from various international customers 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has not been material 
we expect that future license and service revenues will continue to be derived from international markets and may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
through december   we have maintained our international operations and have hired personnel in europe and asia pacific 
we have incurred limited operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
our future operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
in the future  we expect to engage in international sales denominated in both the united states dollar and in foreign currencies 
an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  may use economic hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we can make no assurances that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
through december   the company had not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities 
fixed income securities at december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of million compared to million at december  our exposure to financial market risk  including changes in interest rates  relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
this exposure is limited by the establishment and strict monitoring of compliance with our investment policy which provides for investments in fixed income securities with maturities not exceeding months 
this policy also establishes credit quality standards and limits investment exposure to any one issuer 
we do not invest in any derivative instruments 
due mainly to the relatively short term nature of our available for sale investment portfolio  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates
