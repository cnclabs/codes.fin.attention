item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
you should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
significant accounting policies are discussed in footnote to the consolidated financial statements  item inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
as such  materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operation and financial position include the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model

in and  no earn outs were earned 
in october  we and all of our domestic subsidiaries jointly and severally secured a syndicated line of credit totaling million with a consortium of banks led by bank of america  na line of credit 
on june   we and the banks amended the loan agreements governing the line of credit the loan agreements  pursuant to which amendment i the banks suspended certain of our covenants under the loan agreements  including those that prohibited us from consummating the convertible senior notes offering note without the banks consent  and ii the banks obligations to extend credit under the line of credit were simultaneously suspended 
the amendment contemplates that we and the banks will attempt to negotiate revised terms for the line of credit  to be reflected in a further amendment to the loan agreements  while waiving the requirement for obtaining consent for this offering 
neither we nor the banks  however  have any obligation to enter into such further amendment to the loan agreements 
the amendment did not otherwise effect our right under the loan agreements to voluntarily reduce or terminate the line of credit 
there have never been any outstanding borrowings under the line of credit since its inception 
in february  our board of directors approved a buyback of up to million of our common stock 
as of december   we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock for a total of approximately million 
on may   we purchased certain product lines  related assets and assumed certain liabilities of p m 
the total purchase price of approximately million consisted of cash paid in the amount of million and liabilities of million and resulted in goodwill of million 
results of operations have included p m from the date of acquisition 
pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement  dated june   we sold an aggregate of million of convertible senior notes due june  the holders of the notes may convert the notes into shares of our common stock at any time at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to certain circumstances described in the notes 
we will pay cash interest on the notes at an annual rate of of the principal amount at issuance  from the issue date to june   payable on june and december of each year  commencing on december  after june   we will not pay cash interest on the notes 
at maturity  on june  
table of contents  we will redeem the notes at their accreted principal amount  which will be equal to  per  principal amount at issuance 
we may redeem the notes at our option in whole or in part beginning on june   at of their accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  payable in cash 
holders of the notes may also require us to repurchase all or part of their notes on june   for cash  at a repurchase price of of the principal amount per note plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any

any repurchases at june  and june  may be paid in cash  in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next months 
although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent we grow significantly in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
exchange rates sales from our united states and hong kong operations are denominated in us dollars and our manufacturing costs are denominated in either us or hong kong dollars 
domestic sales from our united kingdom operations and operating expenses of all of our operations are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar or british pound us dollar exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations between the united states and hong kong and united kingdom currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 

table of contents historically and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize our market risk 
interest rate risk as of december   we do not have any outstanding balances on our line of credit 
on june   we issued convertible notes payable of million with a fixed interest rate of per annum 
accordingly  we are not generally subject to any direct risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in hong kong and in the united kingdom 
sales by these operations made on a fob china or hong kong basis are denominated in us dollars 
however  purchases of inventory and hong kong operating expenses are typically denominated in hong kong dollars and domestic sales and operating expenses made in the united kingdom are typically denominated in british pounds  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the british pound or hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
the british pound gave rise to the other comprehensive loss in the balance sheet at december  the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we do not believe that near term changes in these exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of the hong kong dollar or british pound
