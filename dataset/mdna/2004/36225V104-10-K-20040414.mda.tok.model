spin off of national patent development corporation in july  the company announced that it was actively considering a spin off of certain of its non core assets into a separate corporation to be named national patent development corporation npdc 
the spin off  when effective  will result in the company being separated into two independent  publicly held companies 
gp strategies will own and operate the manufacturing process business and information technology business through its subsidiary  general physics corporation  and retain the interest in gse 
npdc will own and operate the optical plastics business through its subsidiary  mxl  and will own the interest in five star and certain other non core assets 
on november   the company filed a ruling request with the internal revenue service the irs  which enables the company to do a tax free spin off of certain non core assets  including mxl and five star 
each holder of the company s common stock would receive one share of npdc common stock for each share of the company s common stock held and each holder of the company s class b capital stock would receive one share of npdc common stock for each share of class b capital stock held 
on march   the irs issued a favorable tax ruling for the spin off 
on february  the company filed documents with the securities and exchange commission relating to the proposed spin off and the company anticipates that the spin off will occur at the conclusion of the sec review process 
the spin off is expected to result in several benefits to the company and its shareholders 
by engaging in the spin off  the company would improve its access to capital and significantly improve its borrowing capacity  thereby satisfying its need to raise additional funds as well as achieving other corporate benefits 
having two separate public companies will enable financial markets to better evaluate each company more effectively  thereby enhancing stockholder value over the long term for both companies and making the stock of each more attractive as currency for future acquisitions 
the spin off will provide npdc s management with increased strategic flexibility and decision making power to realize significant growth opportunities 
having a separate management and ownership structure for npdc will provide equity based compensation that is more closely related to the business in which its employees work

management discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include contract revenue and cost recognition  valuation of accounts receivables  accounting for investments  impairment of long lived and intangible assets and income tax recognition of deferred tax items which are summarized below 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
contract revenue and cost recognition 
revenue recognition general physics contract revenue and cost recognition 
general physics provides services under time and materials  cost plus fixed fee and fixed price contracts 
each contract has different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  requiring general physics to make judgments and estimates about recognizing revenue 
in general  revenue is recognized on these arrangements as the services are performed 
under time and material contracts  as well as certain cost plus fixed fee and certain fixed price contracts  the contractual billing schedules are based on the specified level of resources general physics is obligated to provide 
as a result  on those level of effort contracts  the contractual billing amount for a given period acts as a measure of performance and  therefore  revenue is recognized in that amount 
for other fixed price contracts  the contractual billing schedules are not based on the specified level of resources general physics is obligated to provide 
these arrangements typically do not have milestones or other reliable measures of performance 
as a result  revenue on these arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred over the term of the contract 
general physics believes this methodology provides a reasonable measure of performance on these arrangements since performance primarily involves personnel costs and the customer is required to pay general physics for the proportionate amount of work and cost incurred in the event of contract termination 
revenue for unpriced change orders is not recognized until the customer agrees with the changes 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as a current asset 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as a current liability 
generally contracts provide for the billing of costs incurred and estimated earnings on a monthly basis 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered when making estimates of total contract cost  contract profitability  and progress towards completion 
if sufficient risk exists  a reduced profit methodology is applied to a specific client contract s percentage of completion model whereby the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the amount of costs incurred until such time as the risks have been partially or wholly mitigated through performance 
general physics estimates of total contract cost and contract profitability change periodically in the normal course of business  occasionally due to modifications of contractual arrangements 
in addition  the implementation of cost saving initiatives and achievement of productivity gains generally results in a reduction of estimated total contract expenses on affected client contracts 
such changes in estimate are recognized in the period the changes are determined 
for all client contracts  provisions for estimated losses on individual contracts are made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
as part of general physics on going operations to provide services to its customers  incidental expenses  which are commonly referred to as out of pocket expenses  are billed to customers 
out of pocket expenses include expenses such as airfare  mileage  hotel stays  out of town meals  and telecommunication charges 
general physics policy provides for these expenses to be recorded as both revenue and direct cost of services in accordance with the provisions of eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
gse revenue recognition 
the majority of gse s revenue is derived through the sale of uniquely designed systems containing hardware  software and other materials under fixed price contracts 
in accordance with statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  the revenue under these fixed price contracts is accounted for on the percentage of completion method  based on contract costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete 
estimated contract earnings are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses  and the cumulative effect of any change is recognized in the period in which the change is identified 
estimated losses are charged against earnings in the period such losses are identified 
as gse recognizes revenue under the percentage of completion method  it provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based on historical and projected claims experience 
gse s longer term contracts generally provide for a one year warranty on parts  labor and any bug fixes as it relates to software embedded in the systems 
gse s system design contracts do not provide for post customer support service pcs in terms of software upgrades  software enhancements or telephone support 
in order to obtain pcs  the customers must purchase a separate contract at the date of system installation 
such pcs arrangements are generally for a one year period renewable annually and include customer support  unspecified software upgrades  maintenance releases 
gse recognizes revenue from these contracts ratably over the life of the agreements in accordance with statement of position software revenue recognition 
revenues from certain consulting or training contracts are recognized on a time and material basis 
for time and material type contracts  revenue is recognized based on hours incurred at a contracted labor rate plus expenses 
five star and mxl revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of product to customers 
allowances for estimated returns and allowances are recognized when sales are recorded 
valuation of accounts receivables provisions for allowance for doubtful accounts are made based on historical loss experience adjusted for specific credit risks 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of the historical loss experience of the company and its subsidiaries  judgments about customer credit risk  and the need to adjust for current economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total gross trade receivables was and at december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives result in a charge to operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived tangible assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by determining the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the measurement of the future net cash flows to be generated is subject to management s reasonable expectations with respect to the company s future operations and future economic conditions which may affect those cash flows 
in accordance with sfas no 
 which the company adopted in  goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company conducted a transitional goodwill impairment test upon adoption of sfas no 
as of january   and its annual goodwill impairment test as of december  and the goodwill impairment test requires the company to identify its reporting units and obtain estimates of the fair values of those units as of the testing date 
the company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
the company estimates these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value in both tests conducted in and indicating the underlying goodwill of each unit was not impaired at the respective testing dates 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment tests are based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the estimated fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for impairment and conduct formal tests when impairment indicators are present 
a decline in the fair value of any reporting units below its carrying value is an indicator that the underlying goodwill of the unit is potentially impaired 
this situation would require the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine whether the unit s goodwill is impaired 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is required for the amount which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would become the new cost basis of the unit s goodwill
