overview and outlook general in  we made significant progress towards achieving our strategic objective to solidify our leadership position in the marine  fitness  bowling and billiards industries by introducing innovative products in all our market segments  focusing on cost reduction initiatives through global sourcing and realignment of our manufacturing footprint  acquiring and investing in businesses that will expand and enhance our product offerings particularly in the areas of boat parts and accessories  marine electronics and billiards  strengthening our relationships with our dealers by providing additional products and services that will make them more successful  improve the customer experience and  in turn  make brunswick more successful  and attracting and retaining talented individuals who are responsible for executing and delivering on our commitment to enhance value for our shareholders 
while these activities are ongoing  we have begun to see results from our efforts reflected in our financial performance 
sales in increased percent to  million  primarily due to growth in boat  marine engine and fitness equipment businesses  additional sales associated with acquisitions and the impact of a weaker us dollar 
in addition  we benefited from improved demand for marine products in the second half of the year 
operating earnings for increased percent to million  primarily due to the same factors that drove the sales gain  as well as effective cost management efforts 
these factors helped offset higher pension  health care and insurance costs  a litigation charge recorded in connection with a cross trainer patent infringement lawsuit  and increased research and development expenses 
non operating income increased to million  up from million in  largely as a result of higher earnings from joint ventures and equity investments and interest income 
in  the company reduced its effective tax rate to percent  down from percent in  as a result of a prepayment of million after tax with respect to an outstanding tax case and higher foreign and state earnings generated in lower effective tax rate jurisdictions 
see the results of operations section below for further discussion 
accomplishments in support of our strategic objectives in include new products completion of the development of verado  a family of supercharged four stroke outboard engines  continued roll out of the bayliner  a boat  motor  and trailer package with a manufacturers suggested retail price of  and the launch of the bayliner at a suggested retail price of  introduction of new fitness products  including the signature line of fitness equipment  and introduction of vector  a bowling center management system 
manufacturing realignment start of the phased shut down of our paso robles  california  fitness equipment manufacturing plant scheduled for completion in spring and the consolidation of the production from this facility into our ramsey  minnesota  plant  and

dealer services introduced brunswick acceptance company  a joint venture that provides wholesale financing to our marine dealers 
looking ahead to  we expect retail demand for marine products to increase in the range of to percent  which would be the first annual improvement in retail demand since we estimate that industry growth  coupled with market share gains  success of new products  improved pricing and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in  would result in an to percent increase in our marine sales in fitness and bowling billiards segment sales are expected to increase in the high single digits  again due to new product introductions and the incremental sales from acquisitions 
overall  sales are expected to increase to percent 
operating earnings are expected to improve in  benefiting from higher volumes as well as our ongoing focus on effective cost management 
while we expect pension expense to be down compared with  higher health care and insurance spending will substantially offset this benefit 
we will also incur costs relating to the opening of a second boat manufacturing plant in mexico and an outboard engine plant in china as part of our manufacturing footprint realignment efforts 
the company expects non operating income to decrease as a result of a reduction in interest income 
our effective tax rate in is expected to remain at approximately the same level as matters affecting comparability acquisitions

also  gross margins in benefited from the company standardizing its vacation policy across its divisions 
refer to note  standardization of vacation policy  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for further discussion 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in pension  health care and insurance costs  higher sales of low horsepower and low emission outboard engines  which carry lower margins  severance and outplacement costs recorded in the marine engine segment  and unfavorable manufacturing variances in the fitness segment associated with the closing of the paso robles  california  facility and inefficiencies related to the transfer of production to and new product introductions at ramsey  minnesota 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased by basis points in compared with this increase is almost entirely attributable to the acquisitions completed in and  which accounted for approximately one half of the increase in sg a  and higher pension  health care and insurance costs

the increase in marine engine segment sales was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of sterndrive and outboard engines in the domestic market 
these higher shipments in were largely due to a change in the rate at which dealers and boatbuilders adjusted their engine inventories  rather than higher retail sales 
in  dealers and boatbuilders significantly reduced their wholesale purchases to lower their inventory levels 
reductions in dealer and boatbuilder inventories during occurred at a much lower rate 
improved pricing in the domestic market  increased parts and accessories sales  and an increase in international sales  due in part to favorable currency trends from a weaker us dollar  also helped drive sales growth in the marine engine segment in the decline in operating earnings and margins in was primarily due to higher variable compensation  pension and insurance costs  and a change in the mix of product sold toward low emission two stroke and four stroke outboard engines  which carry lower profit margins

the higher wholesale shipments reflect a more normal purchasing pattern by dealers  whereas in  dealers curtailed purchases in an effort to reduce field inventories 
additionally  revenues from the land n sea and attwood acquisitions accounted for approximately one third of the increase in sales 
the increase in operating earnings in was due to higher sales volumes  cost reduction efforts and improved pricing partially offset by a sales mix shift toward smaller boats  which carry lower margins 
also benefiting the operating earnings comparison was reduced losses at the segment s us marine division  discussed below 
the overall performance of the boat segment was adversely affected in  and by operations at the company s us marine division  which manufactures bayliner  maxum and meridian pleasure boats and trophy offshore fishing boats 
operating losses for the division were million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively  compared with operating earnings of million in in and  losses at us marine were primarily due to sales reductions  operating inefficiencies associated with shifting boat production from five facilities closed throughout to remaining manufacturing plants  the launch of the meridian yacht brand  and the start up of a new plant in mexico to manufacture small boats 
the decrease in the operating loss from to was partially due to reduced discounting and higher sales 
the improvement from to is attributable to increased sales volumes  cost reduction efforts and reduced discounting  partially offset by the reinstatement of variable compensation 
capital expenditures in and were primarily related to investments in new and existing boat models  as well as projects to improve production efficiencies and product quality 
vs 
the increase in boat segment sales in was primarily due to a full year of sales from the acquisitions of princecraft  sealine and hatteras  which were completed in this sales increase was partially offset by a decline in sales from other boat companies 
the decline was driven by weak retail demand  most notably for larger cruisers and yachts

the increase in fitness segment sales was primarily due to increased domestic commercial sales to health club chains and the military  and higher international sales as a result of the weaker us dollar 
domestic commercial product sales benefited from share gains attributable in part to the success of new product and new model introductions  such as cardiovascular equipment and strength training systems 
the increase in sales was partially offset by decreased retail sales at the company s omni fitness stores as a result of various store divestitures  primarily on the west coast and in ohio 
the decline in operating earnings and operating margins was primarily attributed to the previously mentioned litigation charge

critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on the company s reported results 
revenue recognition and sales incentives 
the company s revenue is derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  primarily upon shipment to customers  once the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotional activities  rebates and manufacturer coupons 
the estimated liability for sales incentives is recorded at the later of the time of program communication to the customer or at the time of sale in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products 
the liability is estimated based on the costs for the incentive program  the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if actual costs are different from estimated costs  the recorded value of the liability would be adjusted 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible receivables based upon currently known bad debt risks and records general reserves based on past transaction history with customers  customer payment practices and economic conditions 
actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of net receivables 
changes to the allowance for uncollectible amounts may be required if a future event or other circumstance results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectibility 
table of contents of a specific account 
the company also records a reserve based on historical  current and estimated future purchasing levels in connection with its long term notes receivables for the company s supply agreements 
these assumptions are re evaluated if sufficient product purchases are not made 
a change in this reserve may be required if the estimate of future purchasing levels will not be realized 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand and conditions  historical usage rates  model changes and new product introductions 
if model changes or new product introductions create less than favorable market conditions  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventories may need to increase 
refer to note  significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the basis of accounting for inventories 
warranty reserves 
the company records a liability for standard product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the liability is recorded using historical warranty experience to estimate projected claim rates and expected costs per claim 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
the company s warranty reserves are affected by product failure rates and material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if these estimated costs differ from actual product failure rates  and actual material usage and labor costs  a revision to the warranty reserve would be required 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
litigation 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to claims and litigation  including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures 
the company accrues for litigation exposure based upon its assessment  made in consultation with counsel  of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim 
in light of existing reserves  the company s litigation claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
if current estimates for the cost of resolving any specific claims are later determined to be inadequate  results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required 
the company records a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company establishes its reserve based on its best estimate within a range of losses 
if the company is unable to identify the best estimate  the company records the minimum amount in the range 
environmental 
the company accrues for environmental remediation related activities for which commitments or clean up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated 
all accrued amounts are generally determined in coordination with third party experts on an undiscounted basis and do not consider recoveries from third parties until such recoveries are realized 
the ultimate exposure for these claims has remained consistent with the prior year 
in light of existing reserves  the company s environmental claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for details of existing reserves 
self insurance reserves 
the company records a liability for self insurance obligations  which include employee related health care benefits and claims for workers compensation  product liability  general liability and auto liability 
the liability is estimated based on claims incurred as of the date of the financial statements 
in estimating the obligations associated with self insurance reserves  the company primarily uses loss development factors based on historical claim experience  which incorporate anticipated exposure for losses incurred  but not yet reported 
these loss development factors are used to estimate ultimate losses on incurred claims 
actual costs associated with a specific claim can vary from an earlier estimate 
if the facts were to change  the liability recorded for expected costs associated with a specific claim may need to be revised 
pension and postretirement benefit reserves 
pension  postretirement and postemployment costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  the annual rate of increase in compensation for plan employees  the increase in costs of health care benefits and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a 
table of contents periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit reserves are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  respectively 
refer to note  pension and other postretirement benefits  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the assumptions used and for changes in the accrued benefit 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred taxes are provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 
the company estimates its probable tax obligations based on historical experience and current developments in tax laws and litigation 
the judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation  as well as changes due to new tax regulations and the company s interpretations of those regulations 
these factors may cause the tax rate for the company to increase or decrease 
see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for further discussion 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fin this interpretation clarifies the requirements for a guarantor s accounting for  and disclosures of  certain guarantees issued and outstanding 
fin also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee 
fin is effective for guarantees entered into or modified after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
this interpretation provides guidance on how to identify variable interest entities and how to determine whether or not those entities should be consolidated 
the company is required to apply fin by the end of the first reporting period after march   for entities which were created before february  the adoption of fin was immediate for variable interest entities created after january  the company has not created any significant variable interest entities since january  the company is evaluating its interests in entities created before february   but does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on the financial statements 
forward looking statements certain statements in this annual report are forward looking as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements in this annual report may include words such as expect  anticipate  believe  may  should  could  or estimate 
these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations as of the date of this filing 
these risks include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  stock market performance and consumer confidence levels  and the impact on demand for the company s products  particularly in the united states and europe the company s revenues may be affected by weak domestic and international market conditions and the fluctuating stock market 
global political uncertainty may adversely affect consumer confidence during and beyond 
competitive pricing pressures across all of the company s product lines  introduction of lower priced alternatives by other companies can hurt the company s competitive position 
the company s efforts toward cost containment  commitment to quality products  and excellence in operational effectiveness and customer service are designed in part to offset this risk 

table of contents the ability to maintain effective distribution the company sells the majority of its products through third parties such as dealers  retailers and distributors 
maintaining good relationships with superior distribution partners  and establishing new distribution channels  where appropriate  is key to the company s continued success 
the success of global sourcing and supply chain management initiatives the company has launched a number of initiatives to strengthen its sourcing and supply chain management activities 
the success of these initiatives will play a key role in the company s continuing ability to reduce costs 
the ability to successfully integrate acquisitions the company has acquired a number of new businesses since and intends to continue to acquire additional businesses to complement its existing portfolio 
the company s success in effectively integrating these operations  including their financial  operational and distribution practices and systems  will affect the contribution of these businesses to the company s consolidated results 
the impact of weather conditions on sales of marine products and retail bowling center revenues sales of the company s marine products are generally more robust just before and during spring and summer  and favorable weather during these months tends to have a positive effect on consumer demand 
conversely  poor weather conditions during these periods can retard demand 
in addition  severely inclement weather on weekends and holidays  particularly during the winter months  can adversely affect bowling retail revenues 
financial difficulties experienced by dealers and independent boatbuilders as the main distribution channel for the company s products  dealer health is critical to the company s continued success 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s engine sales are made to independent boatbuilders 
as a result  the company s financial results can be influenced by the availability of capital and the financial health of these independent boatbuilders 
changes in currency exchange rates the company manufactures its products predominately in the united states  though international manufacturing and sourcing are increasing 
a strong us dollar can make the company s products less price competitive relative to locally produced products in international markets 
the company is focusing on international manufacturing and global sourcing  in part  to offset this risk 
the recent trend of a weak us dollar has had a positive impact on international sales of the company s products 
the effect of interest rates and fuel prices on demand for marine products the company s marine products  particularly boats  are often financed  and increases in interest rates can retard demand for these products and affect dealers cost of carrying inventory 
higher fuel costs can also hurt demand for the company s marine products 
the impact of financial markets on pension expense and funding levels the company has made  and will continue to make as necessary  contributions to meet its pension funding obligations 
the company s pension expense is affected by the performance of financial markets where pension assets are invested 
these costs will continue to increase if the performance of financial markets is weak 
the company s ability to maintain market share and volume in key high margin product lines  particularly in its marine engine segment the company derives a significant portion of its earnings from sales of higher margin products  especially in its marine engine business 
changes in sales mix to lower margin products  including low emission engines  as well as increased competition in these product lines  could adversely impact the company s future operating results 
the company is focusing on cost containment efforts  new product development and global sourcing initiatives  as well as operational improvements  to mitigate this risk 

table of contents the ability to maintain product quality and service standards expected by the company s customers the company s customers demand high quality products and excellent customer service 
the company s ability to meet these demands through continuous quality improvement across all of its businesses will significantly impact the company s future results 
the success of marketing and cost management programs and the company s ability to develop and produce competitive new products and technologies the company is constantly subject to competitive pressures  particularly from asian competitors in the outboard engine market 
the company s continuing ability to respond to these pressures  particularly through cost containment initiatives  marketing strategies  and the introduction of new products and technologies that succeed in the marketplace  is key to the company s continued success 
the company s ability to develop product technologies that comply with regulatory requirements the company s marine engine segment is subject to emissions standards that require ongoing efforts to bring the company s engine products in line with regulatory requirements 
the company believes that these efforts are on track and will be successful  but unforeseen delays in these efforts could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
adverse foreign economic conditions as the company continues to focus on international growth  it will become increasingly vulnerable to the effects of political instability  economic conditions and the possibility of military conflict in key world regions 
the ability to maintain good relationships with its labor unions the company employs union members in a number of its divisions 
good relationships with labor unions contribute to the company s ability to maintain an experienced and stable workforce 
inventory adjustments by the company  its major dealers  retailers and independent boatbuilders if the company s dealers and retailers  as well as independent boatbuilders who purchase the company s marine engine products  adjust their inventories downward  in response to weakness in retail demand  wholesale demand for the company s products diminishes 
in turn  the company s inventory reduction efforts have focused on reducing production  which results in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs and thus lower margins 
inventory reduction by dealers and customers can hurt the company s short term results of operations and limit the company s ability to meet increased demand when the us economy recovers 
the company s ability to complete environmental remediation efforts and resolve claims and litigation at the cost estimated as discussed in part i  item above  the company is subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of operations 
these claims include several environmental proceedings  some of which involve costly remediation efforts over extended periods of time  as well as certain litigation matters which if not resolved in the company s favor  could require significant expenditures by the company 
the company believes that it is adequately reserved for these obligations  but significant increases in the anticipated costs associated with these matters could hurt the company s results of operations in the period or periods in which additional reserves or outlays are deemed necessary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
the company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks in accordance with guidelines established by the company s management 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure related to transactions  assets and liabilities that are subject to risk from foreign currency rate changes 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the euro  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar  
table of contents australian dollar and new zealand dollar 
hedging of anticipated transactions is accomplished with financial instruments whose maturity date  along with the realized gain or loss  occurs on or near the execution of the anticipated transaction 
hedging of an asset or liability is accomplished through the use of financial instruments as the gain or loss on the hedging instrument offsets the gain or loss on the asset or liability 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the effect that changes in interest rates have on the fair market value of the company s debt and to lower the company s borrowing costs 
the company s net exposure to interest rate risk is primarily attributable to fixed rate debt instruments 
interest rate risk management is accomplished through the use of fixed to floating interest rate swaps and floating rate instruments that are benchmarked to us and european short term money market interest rates 
raw materials used by the company are exposed to the effect of changing commodity prices 
accordingly  the company uses commodity swap agreements to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases of certain raw materials  including aluminum and natural gas 
the company uses a value at risk var computation to estimate the maximum one day reduction in pre tax earnings related to its foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price sensitive derivative financial instruments 
the var computation includes the company s debt  foreign currency hedge contracts  interest rate swap agreements  commodity swap agreements and futures contracts 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated reduction in fair market value that the company could incur on its derivative financial instruments from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates or commodity prices using the var estimation model 
the var model uses the monte carlo simulation statistical modeling technique and uses historical foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates and prices in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and includes substantially all market risk exposures 
the estimated potential losses shown in the table below  for a time period of one day and confidence level of percent  have no effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in millions risk category foreign exchange interest rates commodity prices the percent confidence level signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices could move in the company s favor 
the var model assumes that all movements in rates and commodity prices will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  as actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in global financial markets
