the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  with phillips designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes 
because phillips was designated as the acquirer  its operations and results are presented in this annual report for all periods prior to the close of the merger 
from the merger date forward  the operations and results of conocophillips reflect the combined operations of the two companies 
business environment and executive summary our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our exploration and production e p and refining and marketing r m segments 
our earnings normally are less impacted by results from the midstream  chemicals and emerging businesses segments 
crude oil and natural gas prices  along with refining margins  play the most significant roles in our profitability 
these prices and margins are driven by market factors over which we have no control 
however  from a competitive perspective  there are other important factors that we must manage well to be successful  including operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely  consistently and in an environmentally sound manner 
safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations 
consistently high utilization rates at our refineries  minimizing downtime in producing fields  and maximizing the development of our reserves all enable us to capture the value the market gives us in terms of prices and margins 
finally  our operations are conducted in a manner that emphasizes our environmental stewardship 

table of contents controlling costs and expenses 
since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell  keeping our operating and overhead costs low  within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship  is a top priority 
we monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly  on both an absolute dollar basis and a per unit basis 
low operating and overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries  as such  cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs 
selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars 
we participate in capital intensive industries 
as a result  we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields  develop newly discovered fields  maintain existing fields  or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes 
we invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars 
however  there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns 
our capital spending in totaled billion  and we anticipate capital spending to be approximately billion in evaluating our asset portfolio 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices 
we also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our growth strategy and should be sold or otherwise disposed 
this management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns 
hiring  developing and retaining a talented workforce 
we want to attract  train  develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics 
many of our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of our operating segment sections that follow 
these include crude oil and natural gas prices and production  natural gas liquids prices  refining capacity utilization  and refinery output 
we also use the return on capital employed measure 
other significant factors that can and or do affect our profitability include property and leasehold impairments 
as mentioned above  we participate in capital intensive industries 
at times  these investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward  when crude oil or natural gas prices decline significantly for long periods of time  or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write down to fair market value 
also  at times we invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which  if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful  could lead to material impairment of leasehold values 
goodwill 
as a result of recent mergers and acquisitions  we have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet 
although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required  future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative affect on the company s profitability 
tax jurisdictions 
as a global company  our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures 
accordingly  our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of earnings within our global operations 

table of contents segment analysis the e p segment s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices 
these are commodity products  the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control 
we benefited from favorable crude oil prices in  which contributed significantly to what we view as strong results from this segment in for a discussion of factors impacting crude oil and natural gas prices in  as well as our view of the potential movement of these prices into  see the outlook section 
at year end  we estimated that a per barrel change in crude oil prices would have an estimated million annual impact on net income 
for natural gas  the corresponding impact is approximately million for a cent per thousand cubic feet price change 
the midstream segment s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices 
the most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our percent equity investment in duke energy field services  llc defs 
higher natural gas liquids prices improved results from this segment in in early  we approved the disposal of some of our non defs midstream assets located in the lower states that are not associated with our e p operations 
refining margins  refinery utilization  cost control  and marketing margins primarily drive the r m segment s results 
refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks  and the sales prices for refined products  which are subject to market factors over which we have no control 
refining margins in were much improved over  resulting in improved r m profitability 
see the outlook section for further discussion of refining margins in and our view of their potential movement into at year end  we estimated that a cent per barrel change in refining margins would have an estimated million annual impact on net income 
for wholesale marketing margins  the corresponding impact is approximately million for a cent per gallon margin change 
our refineries operated at percent of rated capacity in  and our goal in is to operate at about the same level 
the chemicals segment consists of our percent interest in chevron phillips chemical company llc cpchem 
the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which cpchem has little or no control 
the chemicals and plastics industry has been in a cyclical downturn for the last several years 
in this difficult market environment  cpchem has placed great emphasis on safety  cost control and managing its capacity utilization 
in addition  cpchem is investing in feedstock advantaged areas in the middle east with access to large  growing markets  such as asia 
with its low cost structure  we feel cpchem is well positioned to benefit from improved margins when the chemicals industry emerges from its downturn 
the emerging businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations 
we do not expect the results from this segment to be material to our consolidated results 
however  the businesses in this segment allow us to support our primary segments by staying current on new technologies that could become important drivers of profitability in future years 
at december   we had a debt to capital ratio of percent 
we have made a priority of using funds available after paying dividends and capital spending to reduce debt 
we reduced our debt by billion in we feel that by lowering our debt to capital ratio over the next several years to about percent  we can improve our cost of capital and further position ourselves for growth opportunities in the future

income statement analysis vs 
the merger affects the comparability of the and periods 
includes a full year of conocophillips operations  while includes only four months of combined operations 
prior to august   our results reflect phillips operations only 
accordingly  the merger significantly increased sales revenues and purchase costs due to higher volumes of products being bought and sold  equity earnings due to an increased number of equity affiliates  production and operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses due to the increased size and scope of operations following the merger  partially offset by lower merger related costs in depreciation  depletion and amortization due to the increased depreciable asset base  taxes other than income taxes due to higher gasoline sales  production volumes and property and payroll taxes  and interest and debt expense due to higher debt levels following the merger 
in addition to the merger impact  sales and other operating revenues and purchase costs increased because of higher prices for key products such as crude oil  natural gas  automotive gasoline and distillates 
these are commodity products and their price levels are determined by market factors 
our share of earnings from affiliates acquired in the merger accounted for the majority of the increase in the equity earnings 
of these  the e p joint ventures in canada petrovera and venezuela petrozuata  along with cfj properties in our r m segment  provided the largest equity earnings 
on february   we sold our interest in the petrovera joint venture 
of the equity affiliates held prior to the merger  our equity earnings from defs improved on higher natural gas liquids prices  and our earnings from hamaca  an e p heavy oil joint venture in venezuela  increased due to higher crude oil production 
a higher net gain on asset sales was primarily responsible for the increase in other income in during we sold several e p operations that did not fit into our long term growth strategy 
in addition  included gains attributable to insurance demutualization benefits 
see the corporate and other section of segment results for additional information on these insurance benefits 
selling  general and administrative expenses in included a million charge for the write off of in process research and development costs acquired in the merger 
the absence of such a significant charge in the period reduced the impact of the merger on this line item 
property impairments increased by million in  compared with the impairments were recorded as a result of asset status changes from held for use to held for sale  producing properties that failed to meet recoverability tests  and tax law changes in norway affecting asset removal costs

now  the co venturers in the facilities must fund all removal costs  but can deduct the removal costs  as incurred  under the petroleum tax act  at the marginal tax rate in effect at the time of removal 
these changes required us to recognize an additional liability for the government s share  prior to repeal of the act  of the future removal costs  with a corresponding increase in properties  plants and equipment pp e  and to establish a net deferred tax asset for the temporary differences between the financial basis and tax basis of all of our norwegian removal assets and liabilities

off balance sheet arrangements receivables monetization at december   certain credit card and trade receivables had been sold to two qualifying special purpose entities qspes in revolving period securitization arrangements 
these arrangements provided for us to sell  and the qspes to purchase  certain receivables and for the qspes to then issue beneficial interests of up to billion to five bank sponsored entities 
all five bank sponsored entities are multi seller conduits with access to the commercial paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to us 
we have no ownership interests  nor any variable interests  in any of the bank sponsored entities

the two trusts were established to raise funds for general corporate purposes 
on may   we redeemed all of the outstanding subordinated debt securities held by trust i  which triggered the redemption of the million of trust preferred securities of trust i at par value  per share

with the completion of these facilities  water injection is now possible on all three wellhead platforms and gas lift is possible on the n and e wellhead platforms 
these facilities became operational in the fourth quarter of we continued with the appraisal and development of key gas fields in indonesia 
in  we announced the successful test of the suban delineation well on the southwest flank of the suban gas field  located in the corridor psc of south sumatra 
we also completed the successful test of the north sumpal well in the sakakemang block located in south sumatra  and continued on the construction of the south jambi gas project in the south jambi b block also located in south sumatra 
in addition  we continue to develop the offshore belanak and other fields in the block b psc in the natuna sea  for which a floating production storage and offloading vessel is under construction 
the vessel is expected to be completed in the first half of in may  initial results showed that the first exploratory well drilled in block  offshore angola  was a dry hole 
in view of this information  we reassessed the fair value of the remainder of the block and determined that our investment in the block was impaired by million  both before and after tax 
in december  the second exploration well was drilled in block  offshore angola 
the well encountered non commercial gas and was plugged and abandoned 
in view of this information  we fully impaired our remaining investment in the block 
in  we obtained a percent interest in block and a percent interest in block  both offshore nigeria 
first exploration drilling is planned for block in the second quarter of other capital spending for e p during the three year period ended december   supported the eldfisk waterflood development in norway  the jade field development in the united kingdom  the acquisition and development of coalbed methane and conventional gas prospects and producing properties in the us lower  and

capital budget e p s capital budget for continuing operations is billion  percent higher than actual expenditures in twenty six percent of e p s capital budget is planned for the united states  with percent of that slated for alaska 
we have budgeted million for worldwide exploration capital activities in  with percent of that amount  million  allocated to the united states 
outside the united states  significant exploration expenditures are planned in kazakhstan  venezuela  the united kingdom and norway 
we plan to spend million in for our alaskan operations 
a majority of the capital spending will fund prudhoe bay  greater kuparuk and western north slope operations including additional work on the alpine capacity expansion project  orion and west sak field developments construction of endeavour class tankers  and the exploratory activity discussed above 
in the lower  offshore capital expenditures will be focused on the continued development of the magnolia  ursa and princess fields in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
onshore capital will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves within core areas  such as the san juan basin of new mexico and the lobo trend of south texas 
e p is directing billion of its capital budget to international projects 
the majority of these funds will be directed to developing major long term projects  including the bayu undan liquids and gas development projects in the timor sea  the hamaca heavy oil project in venezuela  additional development of oil and gas reserves in offshore block b and onshore south sumatra blocks in indonesia  the second phase of bohai bay in china  projects in the caspian region  including baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline  projects in canada  including syncrude  surmont heavy oil and the mackenzie delta gas development  and the qatargas lng facility in qatar 
in addition  funds will be used to expand the company s positions in the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea 
costs incurred for the years ended december    and  relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were  million   million  and  million  respectively 
as of december   estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the years through were projected to be  million   million  and million  respectively 
r m capital spending for continuing operations for r m during the three year period ending december   was primarily for refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields  to meet new environmental standards  to improve the operating integrity of key processing units  and to install advanced process control technology  as well as for safety projects 
total capital spending for continuing operations for r m for the three year period was billion  representing percent of our total capital spending for continuing operations 

table of contents key projects during the three year period included construction of a polypropylene plant at the bayway refinery in new jersey  construction of a fluid catalytic cracking unit and a s zorb sulfur removal technology s zorb unit at the ferndale  washington  refinery  expansion of the alkylation unit at the los angeles refinery  capacity expansion and debottlenecking projects at the borger  texas  refinery  completion of a commercial s zorb unit at the borger refinery  an expansion of capacity in the seaway crude oil pipeline  and installation of an advanced central control building and associated technologies at the borger facility 
in early  we completed three major projects a polypropylene plant at the bayway refinery in linden  new jersey  and both a fluid catalytic cracking unit and a s zorb unit at the ferndale  washington  refinery 
the bayway polypropylene plant utilizes propylene feedstock from the bayway refinery to make up to million pounds per year of polypropylene 
the plant became operational in march at ferndale  the fluid catalytic cracking unit significantly improves gasoline production per barrel of crude input and the new s zorb unit reduces sulfur in gasoline 
both became fully operational in also in  we made investments related to clean fuels  safety and environmental projects throughout our refining system 
we completed projects at our refineries in ponca city  oklahoma and roxana  illinois  to produce the low sulfur gasoline required by the environmental protection agency epa 
we also began construction of a new diesel hydrotreater at the rodeo facility of our san francisco area refinery that is expected to produce reformulated california highway diesel an estimated one year ahead of the june deadline 
in july  we completed the acquisition of certain refining assets in hartford  illinois  from premcor 
the operations of these assets are being integrated into the operations of our nearby wood river refinery 
the overall production of the refinery will only increase slightly  but integration of the new assets will enable the refinery to process heavier  lower cost crude oil 
startup of the integrated facilities is expected in the second quarter of internationally  we continue to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations  including a replacement reformer at our humber refinery in the united kingdom and marketing growth in select countries in europe and asia 
capital budget r m s capital budget for continuing operations is billion  a percent increase over spending of billion in domestic spending is expected to consume percent of the r m budget 
we plan to direct about million of the r m capital budget to domestic refining  primarily to fund clean fuels projects in order to comply with new epa standards for refined products 
worldwide  clean fuels spending for our r m business is expected to be about million  or percent of the total refining budget 
our us marketing and transportation businesses are expected to spend about million  while the remaining budget will fund projects in our international refining and marketing businesses in europe and the asia pacific region 

table of contents emerging businesses capital spending for emerging businesses during was primarily for construction of the immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the company s humber refinery in the united kingdom 
we expect the plant to be operational in mid emerging businesses capital budget of million is primarily dedicated to the completion of the immingham plant 
contingencies legal and tax matters we accrue for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
based on currently available information  we believe that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
all significant litigation arising from the march   explosion and fire that occurred in an out of service butadiene storage tank at the k resin styrene butadiene copolymer sbc plant has now been resolved 
environmental we are subject to the same numerous international  federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations  as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production industry  and refining  marketing and transportation of crude oil and refined products businesses 
the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include  among others  the federal clean air act  which governs air emissions  federal clean water act  which governs discharges to water bodies  federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  which imposes liability on generators  transporters  and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur  federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which governs the treatment  storage  and disposal of solid waste  federal oil pollution act of opa  under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located  and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the united states  federal emergency planning and community right to know act epcra  which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments  federal safe drinking water act  which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells  and 
table of contents us department of the interior regulations  which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in us waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations  as well as potential liability for pollution damages 
these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and  in the case of discharges to water  establish water quality limits 
they also  in most cases  require permits in association with new or modified operations 
these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process  which can be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency s processing of the application 
many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 
many states and foreign countries where we operate also have  or are developing  similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities 
while similar  in some cases these regulations may impose additional  or more stringent  requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders 
the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards  such as air emission standards  water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations  continue to evolve 
however  environmental laws and regulations  including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change  are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate 
notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 
under the clean air act  the epa has promulgated a number of stringent limits on air emissions and established a federally mandated operating permit program 
violations of the clean air act and most other environmental laws and regulations in the united states are enforceable with civil and criminal sanctions 
the epa also has promulgated specific rules governing the sulfur content of gasoline  known generically as the tier ii sulfur rules  the first phase requirements of which became applicable to our gasoline as of january to meet the requirements  we are implementing a compliance strategy that relies on the use of a combination of technologies  including our proprietary s zorb technology 
the epa also has promulgated rules regarding the sulfur content in highway diesel fuel  which become applicable in in april  the epa proposed a rule regarding emissions from non road diesel engines and limiting non road diesel fuel sulfur content 
if promulgated  this rule would significantly reduce non road diesel fuel sulfur content limits as early as we are currently evaluating s zorb systems for removing sulfur from diesel fuel in special applications 
the refining industry is actively considering several advanced and conventional technologies for complying with these rules 
because the non road rule is not final  we are still evaluating and developing capital strategies for future compliance 
additional areas of potential air related impact are the proposed revisions to the national ambient air quality standards naaqs and the kyoto protocol 
in july  the epa promulgated more stringent revisions to the naaqs for ozone and particulate matter 
since that time  final adoption of these revisions has been the subject of litigation american trucking association  inc et al 
v 
united states environmental protection agency that eventually reached the us supreme court during the fall of in february  the us supreme court remanded this matter  in part  to the epa to address the implementation provisions relating to the revised ozone naaqs 
if adopted  the revised naaqs could result in substantial future environmental expenditures for us 
in  an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement  known as the kyoto protocol  which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations 
the united states has not ratified the treaty codifying the kyoto protocol 
table of contents but may in the future 
in addition  other countries where we have interests  or may have interests in the future  have made commitments to the kyoto protocol and are in various stages of formulating applicable regulations 
currently  it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs that we could incur to comply with such regulations  but such expenditures could be substantial 
we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations 
such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents 
remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present conocophillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the united states 
federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards 
in addition to other cleanup standards  many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe for both soil and groundwater 
mtbe standards continue to evolve  and future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of mtbe contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial 
at rcra permitted facilities  we are required to assess environmental conditions 
if conditions warrant  we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations 
in contrast to cercla  which is often referred to as superfund  the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us 
over the next decade  we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required  but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years 
longer term  expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 
we  from time to time  receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute 
on occasion  we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties 
these requests  notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us  but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations 
as of december   we reported we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at sites around the united states 
in the report  sites from phillips and conoco were listed separately resulting in eight duplicate listings 
these duplicate listings are consolidated in this report 
at december   we had combined the eight duplicate listings  reclassified one existing site  and resolved six sites 
additionally  we had received new notices of potential liability  leaving sites where we have been notified of potential liability 
for most superfund sites  our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us  versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties  is relatively low 
although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites  other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations  and where they have not  or where potentially responsible parties could not be located  our share of liability has not increased materially 
many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned 
prior to actual cleanup  those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions  apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation 
in some instances  we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability 
actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval 
there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant  and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures  neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites  in the aggregate  is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 

table of contents expensed environmental costs were million in and are expected to be about million in and million in capitalized environmental costs were million in and are expected to be about million and million in and  respectively 
remediation accruals we accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
these accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a purchase business combination  which we do record on a discounted basis 
many of these liabilities result from cercla  rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct  or once conducted  operations or at sites where conocophillips generated waste was disposed 
the accrual also includes a number of sites we have identified that may require environmental remediation  but which are not currently the subject of cercla  rcra or state enforcement activities 
if applicable  we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries 
in the future  we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra 
considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs  and under adverse changes in circumstances  potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of december  remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site  depending on the mix of unique site characteristics  evolving remediation technologies  diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies  and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties 
therefore  it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 
at december   our balance sheet included a total environmental accrual related to continuing operations of  million  compared with million at december  the increase in accruals from year end  primarily resulted from evaluation of conoco environmental liabilities during the purchase price allocation period 
we expect to incur the majority of these expenditures within the next years 
notwithstanding any of the foregoing  and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses  environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
however  we currently do not expect any material adverse affect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
other we have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities  alternative minimum tax credits  and loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will  more likely than not  be realized 
uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs 
based on our historical taxable income  our expectations for the future  and available tax planning strategies  management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income 
the alternative minimum tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely to reduce our regular tax liability

historically  in accordance with sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  we have capitalized the cost of oil and gas leasehold interests and  consistent with industry practice  reported these assets as part of tangible e p properties  plants and equipment 
if such interests were deemed to be intangible assets by the eitf  mineral rights to extract oil and gas for both proved and unproved properties would be classified separately from e p properties  plants and equipment as intangible assets on our balance sheet 
this interpretation by the eitf would only affect the classification of oil and gas mineral rights on our balance sheet and would not affect total assets  net worth  results of operations or cash flows 
e p properties  plants and equipment at december  and  included approximately billion and billion  respectively  of mineral rights to extract oil and gas  net of accumulated depletion  that would be reclassified on the balance sheet as intangible assets  if the interpretation that the sec requested the eitf to consider was applied 
we plan to continue to classify oil and gas mineral rights as e p properties  plants and equipment until further guidance is provided by the eitf 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
see note accounting policies 
table of contents in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies 
certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
these critical accounting policies are discussed with the audit and compliance committee on an annual basis and are presented below 
oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
the acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information  prior to the discovery of proved reserves  is expensed as incurred  similar to accounting for research and development costs 
however  leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet  pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect 
property acquisition costs for individually significant leaseholds  management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date 
for leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small  management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area 
for prospects in areas that have had limited  or no  previous exploratory drilling  the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high 
this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost  and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense 
this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds  and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively 
by the end of the contractual period of the leasehold  the impairment probability percentage will have been adjusted to percent if the leasehold is expected to be abandoned  or will have been adjusted to zero percent if there is an oil or gas discovery that is under development 
see the supplemental oil and gas operations disclosures about costs incurred and capitalized costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in acquisition activity  and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties 
exploratory costs for exploratory wells  drilling costs are temporarily capitalized  or suspended  on the balance sheet  pending a judgmental determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort 
this judgment usually is made within two months of the completion of the drilling effort  but can take longer  depending on the complexity of the geologic structure 
accounting rules require that this judgment be made at least within one year of well completion 
if a judgment is made that the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities  the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and are reported in exploration expense 
exploratory wells that are judged to have discovered potentially economic quantities of oil and gas and that are in areas where a major capital expenditure eg  a pipeline or offshore platform would be required before production could begin  and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory work in the area  remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as additional exploratory appraisal work is under way or firmly planned 
for complicated offshore exploratory discoveries  it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal work on the potential oil and gas field 
unlike leasehold acquisition costs  there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended exploratory well costs 
management continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges that the potential field does not warrant further exploratory efforts in the near term 

table of contents see the supplemental oil and gas operations disclosures about costs incurred and capitalized costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in exploration activity and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties  as well as the wells in progress disclosure for the number and geographic location of wells not yet declared productive or dry 
proved oil and gas reserves engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  accounting rules require supplemental disclosure of proved oil and gas reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understanding the perceived value and future cash flows of a company s oil and gas operations 
the judgmental estimation of proved oil and gas reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit of production calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that field 
there are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as proved 
our reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines 
we have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates 
proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and seismic information about each field 
also  as required by authoritative guidelines  the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut in for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of oil and gas prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date 
this estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves 
therefore  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
canadian syncrude reserves canadian syncrude proven reserves cannot be measured precisely 
reserve estimates of canadian syncrude are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in place crude bitumen volume  the mining plan  historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors  installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits 
the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting the bitumen and upgrading it into a light sweet crude oil 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  these estimates are used in determining depreciation expense 
impairment of assets long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group 
if  upon review  the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group  the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value 
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets  at an entire complex level for downstream assets  or at a site level for retail stores 
because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets  the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group 
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes  prices and costs  considering all available information at the date of review 
see note property impairments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 

table of contents asset retirement obligations and environmental costs under various contracts  permits and regulations  we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at production sites 
the largest asset removal obligations facing us involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world  and oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska 
the estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset 
estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult 
most of these removal obligations are many years in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria will have to be met when the removal event actually occurs 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as well as political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
see note accounting policies and note asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
business acquisitions purchase price allocation accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business 
for most assets and liabilities  purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value 
the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties  plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and  for major business acquisitions  typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
we have  if necessary  up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation 
intangible assets and goodwill in connection with the acquisition of tosco corporation on september   and the merger on august   we recorded material intangible assets for tradenames  air emission permit credits  and permits to operate refineries 
these intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives and so are not amortized 
this judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future 
if  due to changes in facts and circumstances  management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives  amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis 
as long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives  they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests  which requires management s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets 
see note acquisition of tosco corporation  note merger of conoco and phillips  and note property impairments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
also in connection with the acquisition of tosco and the merger  we recorded a material amount of goodwill 
under the accounting rules for goodwill  this intangible asset is not amortized 
instead  goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step accounting test 
the first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value including the goodwill of the reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year 
if  however  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment to record  if any 
in this second step  the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of the reporting unit 
the various purchase business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting 
table of contents unit s assets and liabilities 
the residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit  and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower 
the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 
a component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
however  two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics 
we have determined that we have three reporting units for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment 
these are worldwide exploration and production  worldwide refining and worldwide marketing 
our midstream  chemicals and emerging businesses operating segments were not assigned any goodwill from the merger because the two predecessor companies operations did not overlap in these operating segments so we were unable to capture significant synergies and strategic advantages from the merger in these areas 
in our exploration and production operating segment  management reporting is primarily organized based on geographic areas 
all of these geographic areas have similar business processes  distribution networks and customers  and are supported by a worldwide exploration team and shared services organizations 
therefore  all components have been aggregated into one reporting unit  worldwide exploration and production  which is the same as the operating segment 
in contrast  in our refining and marketing operating segment  management reporting is primarily organized based on functional areas 
because the two broad functional areas of refining and marketing have dissimilar business processes and customers  we concluded that it would not be appropriate to aggregate these components into only one reporting unit at the refining and marketing operating segment level 
instead  we have identified two reporting units within the operating segment worldwide refining and worldwide marketing 
components in those two reporting units have similar business processes  distribution networks and customers 
if we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that the components within these three reporting units are no longer economically similar  the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re assigned using a relative fair value approach in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation 
in addition  the sale or disposition of a portion of these three reporting units will be allocated a portion of the reporting unit s goodwill  based on relative fair values  which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition 
because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  management has to apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the first step of the periodic goodwill impairment test 
management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income  and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance 
in addition  if the first test step is not met  further judgment has to be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation 
again  management has to use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance 
at year end  the estimated fair values of our worldwide exploration and production  worldwide refining  and worldwide marketing reporting units  excluding those included in discontinued operations  ranged from between percent to percent higher than recorded net book values including goodwill of the reporting units 
however  a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of the billion of goodwill 

table of contents inventory valuation prior to the acquisition of tosco in september and the merger in august  our inventories on the last in  first out lifo cost basis were predominantly reflected on the balance sheet at historical cost layers established many years ago  when price levels were much lower 
therefore  prior to  our lifo inventories were relatively insensitive to current price level changes 
however  the acquisition of tosco and the conocophillips merger added lifo cost layers that were recorded at replacement cost levels prevalent in late september and august  respectively 
as a result  our lifo cost inventories are now much more sensitive to lower of cost or market impairment write downs  whenever price levels fall 
we recorded a lifo inventory lower of cost or market impairment in the fourth quarter of due to a crude oil price deterioration 
while crude oil is not the only product in the company s lifo pools  its market value is a major factor in lower of cost or market calculations 
we estimate that additional impairments could occur if a percent percent blended average of west texas intermediate brent crude oil prices falls below per barrel at a reporting date 
the determination of replacement cost values for the lower of cost or market test uses objective evidence  but does involve judgment in determining the most appropriate objective evidence to use in the calculations 
projected benefit obligations determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement 
this also impacts the required company contributions into the plans 
the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events  including estimated retirement dates  salary levels at retirement  mortality rates  lump sum election rates  rates of return on plan assets  future health care cost trend rates  and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees 
due to the specialized nature of these calculations  we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations 
for employee retirement income security act qualified pension plans  the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets 
due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies  the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects 
ultimately  we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns  but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time 
benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions 
a percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by million  while a percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million 
outlook after adjusting for asset dispositions  e p s worldwide production for is expected to be about the same level as it was in the dispositions contributed approximately  barrels of oil equivalent per day to production 
for  production increases in asia pacific and latin america are expected to offset net declines in the united states  canada and the north sea 
in r m  the optimization of spending related to clean fuels project initiatives will be an important focus area during in addition  we expect our average refinery crude oil utilization rate for to average about the same as in 
table of contents crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which we have no control  such as global economic conditions  political events  demand growth  inventory levels  weather  competing fuels prices  and availability of supply 
crude oil prices rose significantly in due to supply disruptions during the year in several producing countries and the delays in the return of iraqi crude production to the market in the face of rising global oil demand 
as a result of these factors  global oil inventories remained at exceptionally low levels throughout low oil inventories  coupled with economic recovery and the prospects for higher oil demand growth are expected to keep prices elevated through the first half of us natural gas prices weakened moderately during the second half of from the very strong levels experienced during the second quarter  but the annual average was significantly higher in versus prices weakened in the second half due to a strong buildup of natural gas inventories during the summer and early fall  as mild weather  weak industrial demand and fuel switching reduced natural gas demand 
at the same time  high prices and the startup of a mothballed regasification terminal increased lng imports to the united states 
however  natural gas prices rose moderately in december  reflecting continuing concerns about the adequacy of gas supplies in the united states 
supply adequacy concerns are expected to keep prices above historical levels in refining margins are subject to movements in the price of crude oil and other feedstocks  and the prices of petroleum products  which are subject to market factors over which we have no control  such as the us and global economies  government regulations  military  political and social conditions in oil producing countries  seasonal factors that affect demand  such as the summer driving months  and the levels of refining output and product inventories 
us and international refining and marketing margins rose in versus  due to improved refined product demand and a series of supply disruptions 
us refining margins were above the five year historical average in as a result of refinery outages in several regions of the united states  a product pipeline rupture in arizona  and labor strikes in venezuela  which removed both crude and refined products from the market 
combined with strong product demand  product inventories were drawn down to extremely low levels in the first half of the year  which elevated refining margins 
stronger demand in the face of tight supplies also improved marketing margins in versus the sustainability of current refining and marketing margins depends on the continued recovery of the global economy and refined product demand growth 
in february  the venezuelan government implemented a currency exchange control regime 
the government has published legal instruments supporting the controls  one of which establishes official exchange rates for the us dollar 
the devaluation of the venezuelan currency by approximately percent in february did not have a significant impact on our venezuelan operations  however  future changes in the exchange rate could have a significant impact on our venezuelan operations 
in addition  our venezuelan operations remain subject to civil unrest in the country 
our venezuelan operations contributed approximately million to our net income 
in june  we and our co venturers in the mackenzie gas project in canada announced that funding and participation agreements have been reached and a preliminary information package was submitted to relevant regulatory authorities 
the mackenzie gas project involves natural gas production facilities  compression and gathering pipelines in the mackenzie delta area  and a pipeline system in the mackenzie river valley 
the filing of the information package is a key step in the process leading to the submission of applications for the development of the natural gas fields and pipeline facilities 
regulatory applications are expected to be filed in first gas production is currently targeted to commence in late in july  we signed a heads of agreement with qatar petroleum for the development of qatargas  a large scale lng project located in qatar and servicing the us natural gas market 
this provides the framework for the necessary agreements and the completion of key feasibility studies 
qatargas would be an integrated project  jointly owned by us and qatar petroleum  consisting of facilities to produce and liquefy gas from qatar s north field 
the lng would be shipped from qatar  and we would be 
table of contents responsible for regasification and marketing within the united states 
average daily gas sales volumes are projected to be approximately billion cubic feet per day with startup anticipated in the timeframe 
in late october  we signed a heads of agreement with the nigerian national petroleum corporation  eni and chevrontexaco to conduct front end engineering and design work for an lng facility to be constructed in nigeria s central niger delta 
the participants have agreed to form an incorporated joint venture  brass lng limited  to undertake the project 
the engineering and design studies are expected to be completed in  and the facility is targeted to be operational in in december  we signed a statement of intent with qatar petroleum regarding the construction of a gas to liquids plant in ras laffan  qatar 
the statement of intent initiates detailed technical and commercial pre front end engineering and design studies and establishes principles for negotiating a heads of agreement for an integrated reservoir to market plant 
more definite agreements are expected in also in december  we announced the signing of an agreement with freeport lng development  lp to participate in its proposed lng receiving terminal in quintana  texas 
we would acquire billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity in the terminal for our use and obtain a percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture 
the terminal will be designed with a storage capacity of billion cubic feet and a send out capacity of billion cubic feet per day 
pending government approvals  construction is scheduled to begin in the second half of  with commercial startup in mid in addition  we and our co venturer are pursuing a proposed lng receiving terminal in harpswell  maine 
the proposal calls for construction of the terminal at a site previously used as a us navy fuel depot 
lng would be converted back to natural gas at the terminal for delivery through a new pipeline that would connect the terminal to the existing pipeline grid 
depending on receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals  construction could begin in  with the facility operational by cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements can be identified by the words expects  anticipates  intends  plans  projects  believes  estimates and similar expressions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instrument market risk we and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices  foreign exchange rates or interest rates 
we may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power  natural gas  crude oil and related products  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  or to exploit market opportunities 
our use of derivative instruments is governed by an authority limitations document approved by our board that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the chief executive officer 
the authority 
table of contents limitations document also authorizes the chief executive officer to establish the maximum value at risk var limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily 
the chief financial officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  while the executive vice president of commercial monitors commodity price risk 
both report to the chief executive officer 
the commercial group manages our commercial marketing  optimizes our commodity flows and positions  monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses  and selectively takes price risk to add value 
commodity price risk we operate in the worldwide crude oil  refined products  natural gas  natural gas liquids  and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities 
these fluctuations can affect our revenues  as well as the cost of operating  investing  and financing activities 
generally  our policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities  however  executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production  as well as refinery margins 
our commercial group uses futures  forwards  swaps  and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain  which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives balance physical systems 
in addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration  exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity  providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand  meet customer needs 
consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices  we use swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts  which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers  to a floating market price  manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil  natural gas  refined product and electric power transactions  and enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business 
for the months ended december  and  the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or income from continuing operations 
we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued  including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december   as derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
using monte carlo simulation  a percent confidence level and a one day holding period  the var for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at december  and  was immaterial to our net income and cash flows 
the var for instruments held for purposes other than trading at december  and  was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows 

table of contents interest rate risk the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the debt tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates  the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
the carrying amount of our floating rate debt approximates its fair value 
the fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices

table of contents in october and early november  we executed certain interest rate swaps that had the effect of converting billion of debt from fixed to floating rate 
under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of million of notes due  million of notes due  and million of notes due these swaps qualify for the shortcut method of hedge accounting  so over the term of the swaps we will not recognize gain or loss due to ineffectiveness in the hedge 
interest rate derivatives expected maturity date notional average pay rate average receive rate year end variable to fixed fixed to variable remaining years fixed to variable total fair value position year end variable to fixed variable to fixed remaining years total fair value loss position foreign currency risk we have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from operations in over countries around the world 
we do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes  although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk 
examples include firm commitments for capital projects  certain local currency tax payments and dividends  and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year 
at december   we held foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between european subsidiaries and a us subsidiary 
although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates  we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by sfas no 
as a result  the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings 
since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower  there would be no impact to income from an adverse hypothetical percent change in the december   exchange rates 
the notional and fair market values of these positions at december   were as follows 
table of contents millions of dollars notional fair market value foreign currency swaps sell us dollar  buy euro sell us dollar  buy british pound sell us dollar  buy danish krone sell us dollar  buy norway kroner sell us dollar  buy swedish krona at december   conocophillips had the following significant foreign currency derivative contracts approximately million in foreign currency swaps hedging the company s european commercial paper program  with a fair value of million  approximately million in foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between uk subsidiaries and a uk subsidiary  with a fair value of million  and approximately million in foreign currency swaps hedging the company s firm purchase and sales commitments for gasoline in germany  with a negative fair value of million 
although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates  the company elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by sfas no 
as a result  the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings 
assuming an adverse hypothetical percent change in the december   exchange rates  the potential foreign currency remeasurement loss in non cash pretax earnings from these swaps  intercompany loans  and commercial paper would be approximately million 
in addition to the intercompany loans discussed above  at december   us subsidiaries held long term sterling denominated intercompany receivables totaling million due from a uk subsidiary 
a norwegian subsidiary held million of intercompany us dollar denominated receivables due from its us parent at december  the potential foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses in non cash pretax earnings from a hypothetical percent change in the year end exchange rates from these intercompany balances was million
