income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax expense benefit represents the change during the period in the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized

during the year ended december   we wrote down assets determined to be impaired by approximately million 
the asset write down related to one of our full service car wash sites in texas and two full service car wash sites in arizona 
we have determined that due to poor demographics and increased competition in the geographic areas of these sites  their future expected cash flows will not be sufficient to recover their respective carrying values 
during the quarter ended june   we further wrote down the assets related to one of the full service car wash sites in arizona which we partially wrote down at december   by an additional  the additional write down was the result of the impending loss of a significant customer of this site resulting in an additional reduction of the future expected cash flows of this site and the ability to recover the site s carrying value 
the company closed the facility effective september  we continue to market the remaining two sites for sale and have written down these two assets to their estimated fair market values 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas  we recorded an impairment of approximately million related to our northeast region reporting unit of our car and truck wash segment

of the million of revenues for the year ended december   million or was generated from car wash and detailing  million or from lube and other automotive services  and million or from fuel and merchandise sales 
the decrease in wash and detailing revenues was principally due to closing or divesting of three of our car wash locations and a lube facility during  the temporary closure of a car wash location in arizona due to fire damage  a departure from historic revenue levels within the northeast region due to several significant snow storms in the first quarter of  an increase in inclement weather  particularly on weekends  within the texas region and the impact of a slower economy 
overall car wash volumes declined in from  including from the closing or divesting of the three car wash locations noted above 
partially offsetting this decline in volume  the company experienced an increase in average wash and detailing revenue per car to in  from in this increase in average wash and detailing revenue per car was the result of management s continued focus on aggressively selling detailing and additional on line car wash services 
the increase in fuel and merchandise revenues is the result of more aggressive pricing on fuel to attract traffic into our car wash facilities and the addition of higher quality merchandise in our car wash lobbies

as to the decline in revenues from lube and other automotive services  we discontinued the practice of providing a free wash to lube customers  resulting in decreased lube revenues but benefitting our overall site gross margin performance 
the decline in fuel and merchandise revenues was the result of instituting certain minimum gross margin criteria which reduced fuel sales and the sale of certain low margin merchandise 
security products pursuant to a management agreement  we earned  in and  in these amounts are included under revenues from operating agreements

during and  the costs of previously capitalized expenditures related to proposed acquisitions totaled approximately  and  respectively

during the year ended december   we wrote down assets determined to be impaired by approximately million 
the asset write down related to one of our full service car wash sites in texas and two full service car wash sites in arizona 
we have determined that due to poor demographics and increased competition in the geographic areas of these sites  their future expected cash flows will not be sufficient to recover their respective carrying values 
during the quarter ended june   we further wrote down the assets related to one of the full service car wash sites in arizona which we partially wrote down at december   by an additional  the additional write down was the result of the impending loss of a significant customer of this site resulting in an additional reduction of the future expected cash flows of this site and the ability to recover the site s carrying value 
the company closed the facility effective september  we continue to market the remaining two sites for sale and have written down these two assets to their estimated fair market values 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas  we recorded an impairment of approximately million related to our northeast region reporting unit of our car and truck wash segment

interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december   was million compared to million for this decrease in our interest expense was the result of a decrease in interest rates on approximately of our long term debt which has interest rates tied to the prime rate and a reduction in our outstanding debt as a result of normal principal payments 
interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december   was million compared to million for this decrease in our interest expense was the result of a decrease in interest rates on approximately of our long term debt which has interest rates tied to the prime rate and a reduction in our outstanding debt as a result of normal principal payments 
other income other income for was  compared to  for included in is a  gain on the sale of a car wash facility in our northeast region 
other income for was  compared to  for the primary reason for the decrease was that the figure included a  gain on the sale of a car wash facility in august of income taxes we recorded income tax benefit expense of   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively

no income tax benefit was recorded for the northeast region reporting unit goodwill impairment due to the non deductibility of the goodwill 
at december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
components of the net operating loss carryforwards include million from continuing operations and million from acquired net operating losses attributable to the acquisition of colonial full service car wash  inc liquidity and capital resources liquidity cash and cash equivalents were million at december  the ratio of our total debt to total capitalization  which consists of total debt plus stockholders equity  was at december   at december   and at december  our business requires a substantial amount of capital  most notably to pursue our expansion strategies  including our current expansion in the electronic surveillance products business  and for equipment purchases and upgrades for our car and truck wash segment 
we plan to meet these capital needs from various financing sources  including borrowings  internally generated funds  and the issuance of common stock if the market price of the company s stock improves 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately  at december   working capital was a negative million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
the change in working capital at december  is primarily attributable to renewal and reclassification to non current liabilities of approximately million of year amortizing loans with our current lender 
this was partially offset by reclassification to current liabilities of approximately million of additional loans due and up for renewal in june through october  the company intends to renew these loans with the current lender 
although the company has been successful in renewing similar loans with the current lender in the past  including the renewal of the above mentioned loans in totaling million for a five year renewal period  there can be no assurance that our lender will continue to provide us with renewals or with renewals at favorable terms 
we estimate aggregate capital expenditures for our car and truck wash segment  exclusive of acquisitions of businesses  of approximately  for the year ending december  in october  we purchased a building as a warehouse  production and administrative facility for our new electronic surveillance products operations 
in october  we purchased additional warehouse and office space adjacent to the original facility 
we financed a portion of the  total purchase price of our facility with a long term mortgage of approximately  additionally  we have spent approximately million to date in developing our electronic surveillance products division  including the acquisition costs of micro tech and vernex and the cost of developing and purchasing inventory for our expanded product line 
we will continue to expend significant cash for the purchasing of inventory as we introduce new electronic surveillance products in the future 
debt capitalization and other financing arrangements at december   we had borrowings of approximately million 
we had three letters of credit outstanding at december   totaling  as collateral relating to workers compensation insurance policies 
we maintain a revolving credit facility to provide financing for additional electronic surveillance product inventory purchases 
during and  we refinanced on a long term basis under favorable terms the majority of our short term debt related to our and acquisitions 
several of our debt agreements  as amended  contain certain affirmative and negative covenants and require the maintenance of certain levels of tangible net worth and the maintenance of certain debt coverage ratios on a consolidated level 
at december   we were not in compliance with our consolidated debt coverage ratio related to our gmac notes payable 
with respect to the gmac notes payable  the company has received a waiver of acceleration of the notes through january  additionally  the company has entered into amendments to the bank one term loan agreements as of december  the company is currently in compliance with these covenants as amended 
the company initiated certain temporary and permanent cost savings measures in march of  including reductions in payroll expense and certain operating costs to enable it to maintain compliance with the bank one consolidated debt coverage ratio 
these savings through december  totaled approximately  additional temporary and permanent cost saving measures were intiated in march of  including further reductions in payroll expenses and certain operating costs  along with an increase in prices within the car and truck wash segment to enable the company to maintain compliance with the bank one consolidated debt coverage ratio 
the amended debt coverage ratio with bank one requires the company to maintain a consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to debt service collectively the debt coverage ratio of to at december  and in the future 
as of march   the preliminary operating results for the quarter ended march  indicate that we should meet the bank one required debt coverage ratio as of march   however  we cannot provide assurance that favorable operating trends will continue through march  if we default on any of the bank one covenants or the gmac covenant in the future  the company will need to obtain further amendments or waivers from these lenders 
if the company is unable to obtain waivers or amendments in the future  bank one debt totaling million and gmac debt totaling million recorded as long term debt at december  would become due on demand 
the company s ongoing ability to comply with its debt covenants under its credit arrangements and refinance its debt depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of cash flow 
our cash flow has been and could continue to be adversely affected by weather patterns and economic conditions 
in the event that non compliance with the debt covenants should reoccur  the company would pursue various alternatives to successfully resolve the non compliance  which might include  among other things  seeking additional debt covenant waivers or amendments  or refinancing debt with other financial institutions 
although the company believes that it would be successful in resolving potential non compliance with its debt covenants  or refinancing its current debt  there can be no assurance that further debt covenant waivers or amendments would be obtained or that the debt would be refinanced with other financial institutions on favorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain renewals of our loans or refinancings on favorable terms  our ability to operate would be materially and adversely affected 
the company is obligated under various operating leases  primarily for certain equipment and real estate within the car and truck wash segment 
certain of these leases contain purchase options  renewal provisions  and contingent rentals for a proportionate share of taxes  utilities  insurance  and annual cost of living increases 
future minimum lease payments under operating leases with initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year as of december  are as follows million  million     and thereafter million 
the following are summaries of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt  including capital      leases minimum operating lease payments     amounts expiring per period other commercial commitments total thereafter line of credit standby letters of credit there were no borrowings outstanding under the company s line of credit at december  or on april   we executed a master facility agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion pursuant to which fusion agreed to enter into up to two equity purchase agreements  each with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the master facility agreement expired on february  the first equity purchase agreement was executed by fusion on april  proceeds from purchased shares through december  totaled approximately million 
there were no purchased shares in or cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled  for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities in was impacted by working capital used for the expansion of the new electronic surveillance products division and the effect of increased inclement weather  especially in the northeast and texas regions  along with the impact of a slower economy 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities totaled  for the year ended december  the use of cash in reflects million for capital expenditures  including  relating to ongoing car care operations and  for the expansion of the new electronic surveillance products division 
these expenditures were offset partially by  of cash proceeds from the sale of a car wash facility in our northeast region 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  this reflects routine principal payments on debt of million  proceeds from the issuance of stock under the company s stock option plans of  and  for the purchase and retirement of shares of our common stock 
seasonality and inflation the company believes that its car washing and detailing operations are adversely affected by extended periods of inclement weather 
in particular  long periods of rain and cloudy weather adversely affect our car wash volumes and related lube and other automotive services as people typically do not wash their cars during such periods 
additionally  extended periods of warm  dry weather may encourage customers to wash their cars themselves which also can adversely affect our car wash business 
the company has mitigated the risk of unfavorable weather patterns by having operations in diverse regions 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had  and are not expected to have  any material adverse effect on its results of operations in the near future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are not materially exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity prices 
interest rate exposure a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates  and as such  changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results unless and until such debt would need to be refinanced at maturity 
substantially all of our variable rate debt obligations are tied to the prime rate  as is our incremental borrowing rate 
therefore  a one percent increase in the prime rate would not have a material effect on the fair value of our variable rate debt at december
