item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we primarily derive revenue from recurring akamai services sold to customers under contracts of a duration of more than one year  which we refer to as recurring revenue or long term contracts 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
having a consistent and predictable base level of revenue is important to our financial success 
accordingly  to be successful  we must eliminate or reduce loss of monthly recurring revenue due to customer cancellations of terminations  increase our base level of recurring revenue contracts on a quarter over quarter basis and build on that base by adding new customers in the future and increasing the number of features and functions our customers purchase 
at the same time  we must ensure that our expenses do not substantially exceed our revenue 
accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price  quality and the attractiveness of our services and technology 
see factors affecting future operating results elsewhere in the annual report on form k 
our improved financial results in as compared to and reflect our ability to increase our monthly recurring revenue while reducing the expenses needed to support such growth 
the following sets forth  as a percentage of revenue  consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated revenue cost of revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of other intangible assets amortization of goodwill restructuring benefits charges impairment of goodwill total cost and operating expenses loss from operations interest income interest expense other income loss on early extinguishment of debt gain loss on investments  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss since our inception  we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology  build our worldwide network  sell and market our services and software and support our operations 
in recent years  we have incurred significant restructuring expenses related to employee severance payments and facility lease settlements 
we have not yet achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis  however  we have observed the following known trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operation in the future during each quarter in  the dollar volume of the recurring revenue contracts that we have booked exceeded the dollar volume of the contracts we lost through cancellations  terminations and non payment 
a continuation of this trend would lead to increased revenue for us 

table of contents during  one customer  microsoft corporation  accounted for greater than of our total revenue 
we expect to continue to do business with this customer under a long term contract signed during  and we expect that the revenue from that customer will again be greater than of our total revenue in we expect revenue derived from companies outside the united states will be between and of our total revenue in during recent quarters  we have reduced our network bandwidth costs per unit by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions in the market 
these price reductions contributed to reductions to our cost of revenue 
we believe bandwidth costs will increase as traffic delivered on our network increases 
however  we expect to continue to improve management of our network 
if successful  bandwidth cost per unit would slightly decrease 
during  depreciation of our long lived assets decreased on a quarterly basis mostly due to these assets becoming fully depreciated 
although we expect that the amortization of internal use software development costs  which we include in cost of revenue  will increase in the future  we expect that total depreciation and amortization expense will continue to decrease in due to a decline in equipment purchases in compared to prior years 
additionally  we believe that depreciation will continue to decrease due to a reduction from previous levels as we replace our equipment at lower cost as compared to historical cost 
we expect a net decline in equity compensation costs in as equity awards issued in previous years become fully vested 
this reduction is primarily due to equity compensation charges incurred in connection with issuances of restricted common stock as part of our exchange offer  these restricted shares will become fully vested in may any change in the accounting rules related to employee stock awards requiring that we record expense for employee stock awards at fair value would increase our net loss in the future because we have a significant number of employee options outstanding and expect to continue to grant new options in the future 
the amount of any increase resulting from the change in the method of accounting for employee stock options is not determinable at this time due to the number of variables under consideration when determining fair value of stock awards 
we do not anticipate significant investment losses or gains in the future as our portfolio is currently comprised primarily of high grade debt instruments 
while operating expenses decreased in each of the past three years  we do not expect significant decreases to continue 
we expect a slight increase in operating costs due to a rise in selling related costs and an increase in headcount 
we have restructured our excess leased facilities to align future rent obligations to market rates and to eliminate excess capacity 
we do not anticipate significant restructuring charges in the future  however  we will continue to pursue modifications or settlements on our long term leases if we believe it to be in the best interests of akamai and our stockholders 
in december and january  we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
in december and january  we issued million in principal amount of our convertible senior notes 
in february  we commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to an additional million in principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes 
if the tender offer is fully successful  we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations will not exceed million in we expect to incur additional losses related to the extinguishment of debt in as a result of the repurchase of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in january and  if successful  our tender offer to repurchase up to an additional million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes announced in february 
table of contents based on our analysis of the aforementioned known trends and events  we expect to generate net income during  however  our future results will be affected by many factors identified below in factors affecting future operating results  including our ability to increase our revenue by adding customers through long term contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations  maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenue  address future capital expenditure requirements at costs that are within our expectations  and maintain the prices we charge for our services 
as a result  there is no assurance that the aforementioned trends will continue or that we will achieve our expected financial objectives 
recent events in november  we entered into an agreement with cable and wireless internet services  or cwis  leading to the dismissal of lawsuits filed by cwis against us in boston  san francisco and london alleging that our services infringe several different cwis patents 
we did not admit liability or make any payments in connection with these dismissals 
as part of the settlement  we also agreed to dismiss several lawsuits that we had brought against cwis 
in addition  akamai and cwis agreed not to sue each other for a period of five years with respect to the patents and their respective service offerings that had been at issue in these cases 
in december  we forgave  of  due under a note receivable that had been issued to us by an employee that enabled this employee in  to purchase shares of our common stock 
we recorded the forgiveness of  as equity related compensation 
the remaining  due on the note was paid in full in december in december  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes in exchange for million in cash  which reflected a purchase discount of to the initial purchaser of the notes and other offering expenses 
the notes are due in december  however  we have the right to redeem the notes at par value in december and the holders of these notes have the right to require us to redeem the notes in december the convertible senior notes accrue interest at the rate of per year  which is payable semi annually 
under certain circumstances  holders of these notes may convert them into shares of our common stock at the price of per share 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded interest expense  including deferred financing amortization costs  totaling  in in january  the initial purchaser of the convertible senior notes exercised its option to purchase an additional million in principal amount of the notes for a payment of million  net of the initial purchaser s discount 
in december and january  in a limited number of individually negotiated transactions  we repurchased an aggregate of million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes for an aggregate cash payment of million  net of interest paid or payable to the holders 
in february  we commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to an additional million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
under the modified dutch auction structure of the tender offer  we offered to repurchase up to million in principal amount of validly tendered convertible subordinated notes at a purchase price between  and  for each  in principal amount tendered 
the tender offer is subject to numerous conditions 
the tender offer period is scheduled to expire on march  
table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  investments  capitalization of internal use software  intangible assets  income taxes  depreciable lives of property and equipment  restructuring accruals and contingent obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
for a complete description of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make critical accounting estimates about matters that are uncertain and have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and the specific manner that we apply those principles 
we define a critical accounting estimate as an estimate that requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and either the estimate is derived from a range of potential outcomes or changes in the estimate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue from our services and software when an enforceable arrangement to deliver the service has been established  the service or software has been delivered to and accepted when applicable by the customer  the fee for the service or software is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
at the inception of a long term customer contract for service  we make a critical estimate as to whether collection is reasonably assured 
we base our estimate on the successful completion of a credit check  financial review  the receipt of a deposit from the customer and our payment history with the customer 
upon the completion of these steps  we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  assuming the other criteria are met 
if we subsequently determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we cease recognizing revenue until cash is received 
we also record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all other unpaid invoices for the related customer 
changes in our estimates of whether collection is reasonably assured would change the amount of revenue or bad debt expense that we recognize 
when we provide professional services such as custom applications and other services considered essential to the functionality of software for a fixed fee  we recognize revenue from the fees for such services and any related software licenses as we complete the project using the percentage of completion method 
we generally determine the percentage of completion by comparing the labor hours we have incurred to date to the estimate of the total labor hours required to complete the project based on regular discussions with our project managers 
this method is used because we consider expended labor hours to be the most reliable  available measure of progress on these projects 
adjustments to contract estimates are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known 
when the estimate indicates a loss  such loss is provided for 
table of contents in its entirety 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the percentage of completion of each contract 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
other professional services not considered essential to the functionality of the software are limited and primarily include integration fees 
we recognize revenue from these professional services monthly  along with the related long term customer contract 
when we provide services on a time and materials basis  we recognize revenue as we perform the services based on actual time incurred 
when we provide support and maintenance services  we recognize the revenue ratably over the term of the related contracts  typically one year 
concurrent transactions from time to time  we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology with unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies 
if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently  we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor  unless the fair value to us of the vendor s product or service can be established objectively and realization of such value is believed to be probable 
investments we periodically review all investments for reduction in fair value that is other than temporary 
we consider several factors that may trigger an other than temporary decline in value  such as the length of time the investment s value has been below cost and the financial results of the entity in which we invest 
when we conclude that the reduction is other than temporary  the cost of the investment is adjusted to its fair value through a charge to loss on investments on the consolidated statement of operations 
changes in our judgment as to whether a reduction in the value of an investment is other than temporary could increase loss on investments 
impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset 
when such a triggering event occurs  we compare the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset 
if the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  we adjust the asset to its fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from operations 
we determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a discounted cash flow analysis 
the critical accounting estimates required for this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets and the useful lives of these assets 
changes in these estimates could increase loss from operations materially 
restructuring liabilities related to facility leases when we vacate a facility subject to a non cancelable long term lease  we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us 
in the latter case  we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income 
to date  we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease  the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken  and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan 
beginning in  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we record restructuring liabilities  discounted at the appropriate rate  for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease 

table of contents as of december   we had million in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities 
in  we were able to renegotiate two of our previously restructured facility leases to reduce rents payable under the leases to current market rates  resulting in a reversal of previously recorded restructuring liabilities of million 
we expect that approximately million of the amount accrued as of december  will be paid within twelve months 
in the event that we are able to sublease our restructured space  we will record an adjustment to the restructuring liability in the period in which the adjustment becomes probable and estimable 
loss contingencies we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation and the collectibility of accounts receivable 
we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote  we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
tax accruals and valuation allowance for deferred income taxes we have recorded certain tax accruals to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and property tax positions 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimate of the value of our tax accruals contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we estimated 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of tax related assets and liabilities and the provision for income taxes 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment we are required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
in addition  we have made significant estimates involving current and deferred income taxes  tax attributes relating to the interpretation of various tax laws  historical bases of tax attributes associated with certain tangible and intangible assets and limitations surrounding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we do not recognize current and future tax benefits until it is deemed probable that certain tax positions will be sustained 
capitalization of internal use software costs we capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the application development stage of internal use software projects 
if the project is an enhancement to previously developed software  we must assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software  thus qualifying the work incurred during the application development stage for capitalization 
we must gather employee data for the amount of time incurred during the application development phase 
once the project is complete  we must estimate the useful life of the internal use software  and we must periodically assess whether the software is impaired 
changes in our estimates related to internal use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 
results of operations revenue 
total revenue increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  total revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in total revenue for as compared to 
table of contents was attributable to an increase in service revenue of million  partially offset by reductions in software and software related revenue of million and related party revenue of million 
the increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in monthly committed revenue  along with usage based customer revenue due to an increase in customer traffic delivered during the year 
microsoft corporation was the largest contributor to the increase in revenue attributable to usage that was not pre committed by our customers 
service revenue also increased due to an increase in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts 
as of december   we had  customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to as of december   and  as of december  revenue decreased in as compared to due to a reduction in service revenue of million attributable to a decrease in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts  a reduction in software and software related revenue of million due to a decrease in the amount of software and other technology licensed to customers  as well as a decrease in related party revenue primarily due to the reduction in the monthly commitment of sockeye networks  inc  or sockeye 
for and  and  respectively  of our total revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the united states  of which and  respectively  was derived from operations in europe 
no single country accounted for or more of revenue derived outside of the united states 
for  less than of our total revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the united states 
resellers accounted for of revenue in  in and in for  microsoft corporation accounted for of revenue 
for and  no single customer accounted for more than of revenue 
in september  we executed an amendment to our content delivery services customer agreement with microsoft corporation 
the amended agreement has a two year term with a minimum usage commitment of million 
the parties have agreed that  in august  they will negotiate in good faith appropriate changes  if any  to the pricing levels then in effect 
if akamai and microsoft corporation are unable to reach agreement on requested pricing changes  the pricing will not change  however  microsoft corporation will have the right to reduce its commitment levels by for the second year of the term  and the services shall thereafter be provided on a month to month basis subject to termination by either party on ten days notice 
service revenue  which consists of revenues from our content and application delivery services  increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  service revenue was million for the year ended december  the increase in service revenue in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in monthly committed revenue  an increase in customer traffic delivered during the year and an increase in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts 
the decrease in service revenue in as compared to was attributable to a decrease in customers under recurring revenue contracts  partially offset by an increase in average monthly recurring revenue per customer 
we expect service revenue to continue to increase in as companies continue to choose to outsource some of their it spending 
software and software related revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  software and software related revenue was million for the year ended december  software and software related revenue includes sales of customized technology solutions sold as perpetual licenses or delivered under long term contracts 
the continual decrease in software and software related revenue for the periods presented reflects a reduction in the amount of customized software projects and other technology licensed to customers and a decrease in the number of perpetual licenses executed as we focus on our core services business 
service and software revenue from related parties decreased  or million  to  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  service and software revenue from related parties was million for the year ended december  the reduction in revenue in as compared to from related parties was primarily attributable to revenue in from sockeye  akamai technologies japan kk  or akamai japan  and softbank  or sbbm  a co investor in akamai japan  with no associated revenue in related party revenue in represents revenue from 
table of contents akamai australia  a joint venture with es group ventures pty ltd  relating to resale commitments 
in december and june  the joint ventures of akamai japan and akamai australia  respectively  were terminated 
in  akamai formed a wholly owned subsidiary in japan 
the decrease in revenue from related parties in as compared to was a result of the reduction in sockeye s minimum monthly revenue commitment in and the cancellation in november of sockeye s contract with us 
we expect no revenue from related parties during cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co location of our network equipment 
cost of revenue also includes payroll and related costs and equity related compensation for network operations personnel  cost of licenses  depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal use software costs 
cost of revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  traffic delivered over our network increased during compared to despite this increase in traffic  cost of revenue decreased in as compared to primarily due to lower bandwidth costs  which we achieved by entering into new  competitively priced network contracts  renegotiating existing network contracts to achieve more favorable pricing and continued improved management of our network traffic 
during  depreciation of network equipment continued to decrease as our network assets became fully depreciated 
payroll and payroll related costs  including equity compensation  also decreased in due to a reduction in headcount 
cost of revenue decreased in as compared to by million primarily as a result of a reduction in traffic delivered over our network  lower bandwidth costs per unit and improved management of our network traffic 
cost of revenue during and also included credits received of approximately million and million  respectively  as a result of entering into new  competitively priced network contracts and renegotiation of existing network contracts 
we expect that credits of this nature may occur in the future as a result of our efforts to lower our network costs  however  the timing and amount of these credits  if any  will vary 
cost of revenue is comprised of the following in millions for the year ended december  bandwidth  co location and storage network operations personnel payroll and related costs  including equity compensation cost of software license depreciation of network equipment and amortization of internal use software total cost of revenue we believe cost of revenue will slightly increase in as compared to because we expect to deliver more traffic on our network and that amortization of internal use software development costs will increase 
we anticipate that these increases will be offset by a decline in depreciation of our network equipment 
in addition  higher expenses associated with increased traffic on our network would be mitigated by lower bandwidth costs per unit  if we are successful at continuing to improve our management of our network 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and equity related compensation for research and development personnel who design  develop  test and enhance our services and our network 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  except certain software development costs required to be capitalized 
during the year ended december  
table of contents and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  net of impairments  of payroll and payroll related costs related to the development of internal use software used to deliver our services and operate our network 
we did not capitalize any payroll costs in these capitalized internal use software costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their useful lives of two years 
research and development expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in as compared to  as well as as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in capitalization of internal use software costs and a decrease in payroll and related costs  including equity related compensation  as a result of workforce reductions in the decreases in research and development expenses over these years is quantified as follows in millions decrease in research and development expenses to to payroll and related costs  including equity compensation capitalization of internal use software development costs other total decrease we believe that research and development expenses will increase slightly in as compared to  as we continue to make development investments 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs  equity related compensation and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and service support functions  as well as advertising and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in as compared to  as well as as compared to  was primarily due to a reduction in payroll and payroll related costs  including decreases in equity related compensation attributable to reductions in headcount in sales and marketing during also decreased as a result of reductions in advertising costs associated with an agreement between cnn news group and akamai  which expired in the fourth quarter of the decreases in sales and marketing expenses over these years is quantified as follows in millions decrease increase in sales and marketing expenses to to payroll and related costs  including equity compensation advertising and related costs other total net decrease we believe sales and marketing expenses will increase modestly in as compared to due to an expected increase in commissions and marketing costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of depreciation of property and equipment used by us internally  payroll and related costs  equity related compensation and related expenses for executive  finance  business applications  network management  human resources and 
table of contents other administrative personnel  fees for professional services  the provision for doubtful accounts and rent and other facility related expenditures for leased properties 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily due to reduced payroll and related costs  including equity related compensation  and reduced rent expense as a result of restructurings 
in  general and administrative expenses also decreased due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts  reduced payroll and related costs as a result of reductions in headcount and reduced rent expense as a result of facility restructurings 
the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts in compared to reflected an improvement in the financial health of our customer base which had begun to include more customers that do not rely solely on internet based commerce for their revenues 
the decrease in general and administrative over these years is quantified as follows in millions decrease increase in general and administrative expenses to to bad debt expense payroll and related costs  including equity compensation rent and facilities depreciation other total net decrease we do not expect significant further decreases in general and administrative expenses in as compared to  rather we believe that these expenses will remain constant in amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
amortization of other intangible assets decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  amortization of other intangible assets decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  intangible assets acquired in business combinations were fully amortized as of the end of the first quarter of  therefore  there was no corresponding amortization of such intangibles assets in the remainder of the decrease in amortization of other intangible assets in as compared to was primarily due to the discontinuation of assembled workforce amortization in  partially offset by an impairment to intangible assets in we expect to amortize approximately  of intangible assets in and in each year thereafter through  during which they will become fully amortized 
amortization of goodwill 
we no longer amortize goodwill as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  in accordance with sfas no 
 we reclassified assembled workforce intangible assets of approximately million to goodwill 
the resulting balance of goodwill was million on january  for purposes of performing an impairment test  we determined that we had one reporting unit  and we assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit as of january   and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of january   and  respectively 
the fair value on january   and exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit  including goodwill  as of these dates 
accordingly  we concluded that no impairment existed on these dates 
unless changes in events or 
table of contents circumstances indicate that an impairment test is required  we will next test goodwill for impairment as of january  amortization of goodwill was million for the year ended december  restructuring charges 
we recorded net restructuring benefits of million as a result of amendments to and terminations of facility leases during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million  which represents million for employee severance benefits and million attributable to facility leases and long lived asset impairments 
during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million  which represents million for employee severance benefits and million attributable to facility leases and long lived asset impairments 
our restructuring expenses are summarized as follows in millions for the year ended december  facility leases severance total during  in connection with the termination of our facility leases for and technology square in cambridge  massachusetts  we recorded restructuring charges of million for the difference between the actual termination costs and the amount previously accrued 
also during  we recorded restructuring charges of million representing the difference between the anticipated costs to terminate or modify vacant facilities under non cancelable lease agreements and the previously recorded restructuring liabilities for these properties 
in addition  we impaired leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  deposits  deferred rent and other long lived assets related to these facilities in the amount of million 
during  we amended or terminated three long term leases in connection with which we paid our lessors a total of million in cash and restricted cash 
as a result of these lease amendments and terminations  we reversed million of previously accrued restructuring liabilities and recorded million for costs relating to the restructuring of a facility in europe 
these three transactions are as follows in april  we amended our lease obligation for a substantially vacant facility in santa clara  california 
under the terms of the amendment  we made a payment of million 
the total payment also included the release of million in restricted cash 
as a result of this amended lease agreement  we reversed million of previously accrued restructuring liabilities 
we continued to pay rent at the previously contracted rate through the end of beginning in january  rent will be reduced to a lower rate substantially aligned with market rates in the area 
the amended lease is scheduled to terminate in august as of december   the remaining restructuring liability related to this facility was million 
as we make the remaining contractual rent payments allocable to the vacated space  this liability will be reduced 
we are actively seeking a subtenant for this space 
we have estimated no sublease income for this facility due to the market conditions in the area 
in may  we terminated our lease for a facility located in the united kingdom for a fee of approximately  in connection with this lease termination  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for costs related to the termination fee and the write off of long lived assets and long term deposits  of which  represents a non cash restructuring charge for impairments of leasehold improvements and other long lived assets 
we have relocated our operations in the united kingdom to a smaller facility 
in june  we terminated our long term lease for our san mateo  california facility for a payment of million and entered into a new lease for less space in this facility 
as a result of this terminated lease  we reversed  of previously recorded restructuring liabilities 
of the million payment  million was recorded as a prepayment for the remaining utilized space and is being amortized over the remaining term of the original lease 
we have previously accrued a restructuring liability for the vacant portion of the original lease 
the new lease is scheduled to expire in may 
table of contents rent payments under the new lease are lower than under the original lease  and are more in line with current market rates 
the following table summarizes the establishment and usage of the restructuring liabilities related to real estate leases in millions restructuring liabilities ending balance  december  restructuring charges for the twelve months ended december  cash payments non cash items ending balance  december  restructuring benefits net  for the twelve months ended december  includes the reversal of million of previously accrued restructuring liabilities cash payments non cash items ending balance  december  current portion of accrued restructuring long term portion of accrued restructuring we do not anticipate significant restructuring charges in the future  however  we will continue to pursue modifications or settlements on our long term leases if we believe it to be in the best interests of akamai and our stockholders 
we have estimated the amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate leases based on the most recent available market data and discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors 
impairment of goodwill 
during the first quarter of  we reviewed goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment under the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we considered several factors in determining whether an impairment may have occurred  including our market capitalization compared to book value  the overall business climate and recent estimates for operating results of acquired businesses 
a review of these factors as of march  indicated that an impairment assessment was required for long lived assets of acquired businesses 
we grouped all long lived assets for acquired businesses  including goodwill and other intangible assets  and estimated the future discounted cash flows related to these long lived assets 
the discount rate used was based on the risks associated with the acquired businesses 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of  million during the first quarter of to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill to its fair value as of march  interest income

the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders

table of contents arrangement includes a general right to return the delivered element  delivery or performance of the undelivered element is considered probable
