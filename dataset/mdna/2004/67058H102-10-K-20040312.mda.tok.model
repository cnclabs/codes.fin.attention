these assets and their related operations are referred to herein as the ultramar diamond shamrock logistics business 
effective july   uds transferred the ultramar diamond shamrock logistics business along with certain liabilities to shamrock logistics operations  lp shamrock logistics operations  a wholly owned subsidiary of shamrock logistics  lp shamrock logistics 
shamrock logistics was also wholly owned by uds 
data in the following table prior to the july  transfer is indicated as predecessor and data subsequent thereto is indicated as successor 
on april   shamrock logistics completed its initial public offering of common units  which represented of its outstanding partnership interests 
effective on december   uds merged with and into valero energy 
this acquisition included the acquisition of uds majority ownership interest in shamrock logistics and subsidiary 
the consolidated balance sheet of shamrock logistics and subsidiary as of december  was not adjusted to fair value due to the significant level of public ownership interest in shamrock logistics 
effective january   shamrock logistics changed its name to valero lp  and shamrock logistics operations changed its name to valero logistics operations  lp valero logistics 
the selected financial data and operating data for the year ended december   and for the six months ended june   reflect the operations of the ultramar diamond shamrock logistics business the predecessor to shamrock logistics operations as if it had existed as a single separate entity from uds 
the transfer of the ultramar diamond shamrock logistics business to shamrock logistics operations represented a reorganization of entities under common control and was recorded at historical cost 
the selected financial data and operating data for the six months ended december   and for the years ended december   and  represent the consolidated operations of valero lp and valero logistics 
the selected financial data as of december   includes the acquisition of the wichita falls business  which valero lp acquired on february  from valero energy 
because valero lp and the wichita falls business came under the common control of valero energy commencing on december   the acquisition represented a reorganization of entities under common control

income tax expense for the year ended december  represents income tax expense incurred by the wichita falls business during the month ended january   prior to the acquisition of the wichita falls business by valero lp on february  effective july   uds transferred the ultramar diamond shamrock logistics business to shamrock logistics operations 
as a limited partnership  shamrock logistics operations was not subject to federal or state income taxes 
due to this change in tax status  the deferred income tax liability of million as of june  was written off in the statement of income of the ultramar diamond shamrock logistics business for the six months ended june  the resulting income tax benefit of million for the six months ended june   includes the write off of the deferred income tax liability less the income tax expense of million for the six months ended june  the income tax expense for periods prior to july  was based on the effective income tax rate for the ultramar diamond shamrock logistics business of 
the effective income tax rate exceeds the us federal statutory income tax rate due to state income taxes 
net income per unit applicable to limited partners is computed by dividing net income applicable to limited partners  after deduction of the general partner s interest and incentive distributions  by the weighted average number of limited partnership units outstanding for each class of unitholder

management presents ebitda in its filings under the securities exchange act of and in its press releases 
management uses this financial measure because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by some investors and analysts to analyze and compare partnerships on the basis of operating performance 
ebitda is not intended to represent cash flows for the period  nor is it presented as an alternative to operating income or net income 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
valero lp s method of computation for ebitda may or may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other partnerships 
the partners equity amount as of december  includes million of net parent investment resulting from valero lp s acquisition of the wichita falls business on february   which represented a transfer between entities under common control and therefore required a restatement of the december  consolidated balance sheet of valero lp to include the wichita falls business as if it had been combined with valero lp as of december  upon execution of the acquisition on february   partners equity net parent investment was reduced by million 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview valero lp s operations provide transportation and storage services to valero energy and other unrelated customers 
valero lp provides these services with its crude oil and refined product pipelines  refined product terminals and crude oil storage tanks located near or connected to eight of valero energy s refineries 
as a result of the significant relationship with valero energy  the operating results of valero lp are affected by factors affecting the business of valero energy  including refinery utilization rates  refinery maintenance turnarounds  crude oil prices  the demand for refined products and industry refining capacity 
since valero lp s initial public offering in  valero lp has more than doubled in size as a result of the acquisitions it has completed 
in  after the initial public offering  valero lp acquired the southlake refined product terminal and the ringgold crude oil storage facility connected to the ringgold to ardmore crude oil pipeline for a combined total cost of million  in  valero lp acquired the wichita falls to mckee crude oil pipeline and related wichita falls crude oil storage facility and the texas city crude hydrogen pipeline for a combined total cost of million  and in  valero lp acquired the south texas pipelines and terminals  the crude oil storage tanks  the southlake refined product pipeline  the telfer asphalt terminal  the shell pipeline interest and the paulsboro refined product terminal for a combined total cost of million 
these acquisitions have resulted in an increase in revenues and increase in net income from the year ended december  to the year ended december  to fund these acquisitions as well as the redemption of million of common units  common units in march  valero lp used a combination of debt and equity offerings as follows in  valero logistics issued million of senior notes  and in  valero logistics issued million of senior notes and valero lp issued  common units for million  including general partner contributions 
in february  valero lp acquired the royal asphalt terminals for million and borrowed million under the revolving credit facility to fund the royal acquisition and to fund a portion of the nuevo laredo  mexico propane terminal and related pipeline construction costs 
management intends to further grow the asset base of valero lp by completing additional acquisitions and or expanding existing facilities in order to increase the cash distributions to unitholders 
since valero lp s initial public offering  the quarterly cash distribution paid to its limited partners has increased from per unit for the second quarter of to per unit for the fourth quarter of total cash distributions paid to unitholders and the general partner have totaled million for the period from april  through december  implementation of segment reporting prior to march   valero lp was a consolidated subsidiary of valero energy and its operating performance was measured on an entity level basis 
this measurement methodology was also used by uds prior to valero energy s acquisition of uds on december  in addition  operational management of valero lp reported to valero energy management as part of valero energy s pipelines and terminals division 
the historical organizational structure and method used to measure operating performance resulted in valero lp having only one segment  an entity level segment 
on march   as a result of the common unit redemption transaction  the sale of additional common units to the public and certain changes to the partnership agreement  valero energy s equity ownership in valero lp was reduced to and valero energy was deemed to no longer control valero lp accordingly  valero lp was no longer consolidated into valero energy 
at the same time that the ownership level of valero lp was reduced  a new expanded management team was announced  which separated valero lp s business into four operating units 
based on these changes and the subsequent development of performance metrics for each operating unit  it was determined that valero lp had four business segments in accordance with statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the four segments include the refined product pipelines segment  the crude oil pipelines segment  the refined product terminals segment and the crude oil storage tanks segment 
historical information for the years ended december  and has been restated to reflect the new segments

revenue recognition revenues are derived from interstate and intrastate pipeline transportation of crude oil and refined products  the storage and throughput of crude oil and the terminalling and blending of refined products 
transportation revenues are based on pipeline tariffs that are subject to extensive federal and or state regulation 
terminalling and blending revenues are based on fees which valero lp believes are market based 
reductions to the current pipeline tariffs or terminalling and blending fees charged could have a material adverse effect on valero lp s results of operations 
for the year ended december   of valero lp s revenues were derived from valero energy and valero energy has agreed not to challenge certain of valero lp s pipeline tariffs or terminalling fees until at least april see note related party transactions for a discussion of valero lp s relationship with valero energy 
depreciation depreciation expense is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of valero lp s property  plant and equipment 
because of the expected long useful lives of the property  plant and equipment  valero lp depreciates its property over periods ranging from years to years 
changes in the estimated useful lives of the property  plant and equipment could have a material adverse effect on valero lp s results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset goodwill is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in order to test for recoverability  management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset which include  but are not limited to  assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset  estimated remaining life of the asset  and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset s existing service potential 
in order to determine fair value  management must make certain estimates and assumptions including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  interest equity rates and growth rates  that could significantly impact the fair value of the long lived asset or goodwill 
due to the subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value  significant impairment charges could result in the future  thus affecting valero lp s future reported net income 
asset retirement obligation an entity is required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
if a reasonable estimate cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred  the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 

table of contents in order to determine fair value  management must make certain estimates and assumptions including  among other things  projected cash flows  a credit adjusted risk free rate  and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation 
these estimates and assumptions are very subjective 
valero lp has determined that it is obligated by contractual or regulatory requirements to remove assets or perform other remediation upon retirement of certain assets 
however  the fair value of the asset retirement obligation cannot currently be reasonably estimated because the settlement dates are indeterminate 
valero lp will record an asset retirement obligation in the periods in which it can reasonably determine the settlement dates 
income allocation valero lp s net income for each quarterly reporting period is first allocated to the general partner in an amount equal to the general partner s incentive distribution declared for the respective reporting period
