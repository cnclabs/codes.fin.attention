overview we are a telecommunications company with annual revenues for of  our original core business  which dates back to  consisted primarily of providing telecommunications services in our ilec territory which today covers approximately square miles and is located north of the city of pittsburgh 
in  as the internet was still in its relatively early stages  we purchased a small isp as a segue into that market 
during  we began to expand our business beyond our ilec territory via a clec edge out strategy 
in addition  from through  we invested approximately million in our ilec territory to upgrade the majority of our network and deploy a csa architecture in order to allow us to offer advanced broadband products 
today  the investments that we have made to develop our internet related products  to expand our business via our edge out strategy and to modernize our network for advanced broadband products have provided the majority of our revenue growth 
the great majority of our revenues are generated based on monthly recurring services and are therefore not subject to large short term fluctuations 
in addition to our core businesses described above  we also derive a portion of our net income and cash flow from our limited partner interests in three wireless partnerships  all of which are majority owned and operated by verizon wireless 
these partnerships  which have their origin in the s with the allocation by the fcc of b licenses  cover territories which overlap the majority of our ilec and edge out markets 
industry dynamics demand for the traditional voice telecommunications business has been negatively impacted by the proliferation of wireless services led by one rate bundled pricing plans that include large if not unlimited buckets of minutes  the popularity of alternative communication technologies such as email and instant messaging and by technological advances such as cable modems and dsl that obviate the need for secondary  and in some cases primary  access lines 
in addition  the telecommunications industry has experienced a very difficult period of contraction brought on by over investments in the late s that have created excess capacity in certain markets 
as a result  the industry has experienced a relatively high number of major bankruptcies over the past several years 
besides the negative financial ramifications of absorbing write offs of pre petition amounts owed from such carriers  we are now faced with many of these companies re emerging from bankruptcy with restructured balance sheets and greater financial flexibility 
broadband growth has been a bright spot in the overall industry over the past several years 
however  the broadband market is very competitive  with little differentiation to the end user customer between products offered by telephone and cable companies 
as such  pricing has been the main focus in winning new customers and retaining existing customers 
although the costs to deliver broadband technologies have decreased over the past several years  margins have continued to be squeezed by pricing decreases to customers 
the proliferation of broadband access has also resulted in new threats from innovative technologies  such as voip  that threaten to further decrease the revenues received from the traditional voice business 
besides potentially displacing the need for a secondary or primary line  the potential 
table of contents regulatory definition and classification of voip services which takes on many forms may have a significant impact on the current access compensation structure 
regulation and competition the telecommunications industry was greatly impacted by the passage of the act  which was the legislative instrument that opened the industry to significantly greater competition 
the degree and pace at which markets have been experiencing competition have varied  with most of the original regulatory barriers to entry removed in the markets served by the country s largest local exchange carriers  also referred to as the regional bell operating companies rbocs 
smaller rural companies  such as our ilec  north pittsburgh  were given regulatory relief in the form of exemptions and temporary suspensions from many of the competitive portions of the act in order to allow state regulators sufficient time to examine the public policy implications of allowing competition in rural areas  and if deemed in the public interest  to allow smaller companies to gradually prepare for competition and to restructure rates 
although we still maintain in our ilec territory some of the regulatory protections against non facilities based competition  we expect that over time these protections will be reduced and or entirely eliminated 
while the act has placed a higher degree of uncertainty on our future revenue streams and margins in our ilec territory  it has given us the opportunity to selectively expand outside of that territory by taking advantage of the pro competitive aspects of the act 
we have pursued an edge out strategy into pittsburgh and its surrounding communities as well as into the city of butler and its surrounding areas  leveraging the network  human capital skills and solid reputation of our traditional ilec business 
the act primarily deals with regulations concerning intra modal competition that is  competition among traditional wireline companies 
at the same time  however  we have begun to experience a great deal of inter modal competition  from wireless carriers and cable companies 
we view these facilities based competitors to be the most formidable  as these companies can totally bypass our existing networks 
highlights and outlook revenues for increased  or  over the majority of this growth was attributable to our ability to continue to effectively penetrate our edge out markets as well as expand our broadband service offerings 
total operating expenses for increased  or compared to aside from the direct costs associated with access line and revenue growth  expenses were also impacted by one time charges of  associated with a workforce reduction program as well as significant increases in healthcare  pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
for  we expect that competition for all of our service offerings will continue to intensify  resulting in further pressures on operating margins 
we would expect that our key revenue growth drivers will continue to be in the form of adding new customers in our edge out markets and further broadband penetration 
we have also started to focus to an even greater extent on bundled product offerings  which we anticipate will drive value to our customers and serve as a retention tool for our existing customer base 
our cost structure is heavily weighted towards labor and depreciation 
as such  there is not a great deal of direct correlation between our revenues and our largest operating expenses 
increases in our labor costs have outpaced our revenue growth over the past several years  primarily driven by increases in healthcare costs and pension benefit expenses 
we have taken steps  such as the workforce reduction implemented in and using our excess cash reserves to make additional 
table of contents contributions into the pension plan  to address some of these issues 
we have also implemented and executed a targeted capital expenditure program  in which the majority of our expenditures are directly related to new customer additions 
the significant network modernization investments which we made from through have enabled us to keep our maintenance capital expenditures defined as capital expenditures needed to continually replace and or expand our network capabilities to address our existing customer base at levels of of revenues over the last several years  much lower than the industry average of over 
maintaining our existing operating margins going forward will be challenging as competition intensifies and lower margin services  such as dsl and clec access lines  generate a larger percentage of our overall revenues 
however  we will continue to manage our cost structure and capital spending aggressively 
our financial condition and balance sheet have continually improved over the last several years through prudent investment strategies and strong cash flows generated from operating activities 
unlike many telecommunication companies that have substantially leveraged their businesses  we have a greater amount of cash on hand  than our total debt outstanding 
our financial condition gives us the ability to invest in new products and or opportunities and the flexibility to continue to evaluate ways to create greater shareholder value  whether through our dividend policy  stock repurchases or other investment opportunities 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  included in this annual report 
results of operations vs 
net income for was  or 
per share  compared to net income of  or 
per share  for the increase in net income was attributable to the following factors operating revenues total operating revenues increased  or  during this increase was the result of increases in local network services revenues of   long distance and access services revenues of  and other operating revenues of   offset partially by decreases in directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of and telecommunication equipment sales of 
increases in local network services revenues of  or  were primarily attributable to the following factors local dial tone revenues increased  during the increase was partially a result of total access lines including clec growing by  lines  or  from  access lines as of december  to  access lines as of december  more specifically  the total growth was a result of a  access line increase in our edge out markets offset partially by a  access line decrease in our ilec market 
also contributing to the increase was an approximate increase in local dial tone revenues due to revenue neutral rate re balancings at north pittsburgh during  which increased local residential rates and decreased intrastate access rates 
revenues earned from pris increased during  mostly as a result of an increase in the number of circuits in our edge out markets from circuits as of december  to circuits as of december  the majority of this circuit growth in our edge out markets was the result of winning isp customers away from the incumbent 
isps use pri s as a component of their network for dial up traffic 
the continued penetration of broadband services has led to customers migrating from dial up 
table of contents connections to broadband access  and we therefore expect the organic growth in the dial up business to be greatly reduced from previous rates and most likely turn negative in the very near future 
although we expect to continue to increase our circuit count in our edge out markets by winning isp customers from the incumbent  we already have a relatively high penetration rate in the markets in which we currently operate 
as such  we expect the growth rate in revenues from pri circuits to decrease during vertical feature revenues which include revenues from custom calling features such as voicemail  caller id  call waiting  etc 
increased by during  mostly as a result of the total growth in access lines and a more intensive promotional campaign 
although vertical feature revenues may continue to grow if we are successful in increasing access lines  the amount of vertical feature revenue per line is expected to continue to drop in the future  mostly as a result of the discounting of these features in bundled packages that are continuing to grow in popularity 
local reciprocal compensation revenues increased by during in association with the growth in terminating traffic generated by the above mentioned increase in access lines and pris 
the increase in long distance and access services revenues of  or  was primarily attributable to the following factors access revenues increased  during due primarily to an increase in minutes of use mous and end user interstate access charges generated by the growth in access lines and switched circuits 
access revenues also increased as a result of changes in the national exchange carrier association neca average schedule settlement formulas in which north pittsburgh participates 
in addition  access revenues for were favorably impacted by in final inter carrier settlement adjustments covering a two year period 
we believe that the current growth rate in access revenues of approximately will most likely not be sustainable in access revenues at penn telecom were negatively impacted in september of as a result of a revision made by verizon in the percent local use plu factor used to settle traffic between the companies 
at that time  the plu factor change resulted in an approximate per month decrease in intrastate access revenues recognized 
as the impact of the plu adjustment affected only four months in  year over year comparisons for full year will be negatively impacted by an entire twelve months of the adjustment 
in addition  in conjunction with the fcc s access charge reform order  penn telecom s interstate access rates are being phased down over a three year period  which began in  and will mirror the incumbent s rate effective june  we expect that the impact of the interstate rate change will be an approximate per month decrease in access revenues 
special access revenues increased during  mostly as a result of increases in the number of ds s and ds circuits sold 
overall toll revenues the combination of metro area  intralata and interlata toll increased  reversing the trend of the last several years of period over period decreases 
we have continued to be successful in bundling toll in our edge out markets in which there was a  growth in access lines  with nearly a subscription rate 
in addition  there was greater price stabilization in the toll market in although this trend positively impacted results for  the introduction of aggressively priced flat rate toll packages from voip providers  coupled with the already intense pricing competition in the wireless market  may eventually cause the rate of decrease in average toll prices to once again accelerate 

table of contents the increase in other operating revenues of  or  was primarily due to two factors 
one was the growth of dsl revenues of approximately  as combined dsl lines both wholesale and retail sold increased from  as of december  to  as of december  the second factor was that the prior year period included approximately in charges associated with the bankruptcies of carriers  most notably worldcom and global crossing 
these charges were recorded as reductions in revenue in the decrease in directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of was mostly attributable to a slight decrease in directory advertising revenues  due to greater competition in a relatively soft advertising market 
the decrease in telecommunication equipment sales of was due to lower post sale support revenues 
operating expenses and net operating income total operating expenses increased  or  during the change was the result of increases in network and other operating expenses of   depreciation and amortization expenses of  and state and local taxes of  offset partially by a minor decrease in telecommunications equipment expenses of 
the increase in network and other operating expenses of  or  was primarily due to increases in the direct costs associated with the growth in access lines and access line equivalents 
such direct costs include the fees paid for leasing unes in the portions of our edge out markets that we do not provision over our own facilities  fees paid to terminate the increased local  toll and internet traffic generated by our growing customer base and overall general increases in sales and support areas 
in addition to the aforementioned costs  which normally increase as our customer base and network grows  the following costs also contributed to the increase in network and other operating expenses we recorded  in charges associated with a workforce reduction program at our north pittsburgh subsidiary 
the charges consisted of  in severance and early retirement incentives and  in non cash curtailment charges associated with the acceleration of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations 
our net periodic benefit costs for our pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans excluding the curtailment charges mentioned above increased  and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in pension costs was the result of the historically low interest rate environment and overall poor performance of the equity markets from through net periodic benefit costs are calculated at the beginning of a plan year and therefore our expected return on plan assets did not include the above average returns in the equity markets during 
we expect  based on the strong performance of the assets in the plan during  the additional contributions above the minimum required level that were made to the plan in both and the early part of and the decrease in the number of plan eligible participants as a result of the workforce reduction noted above  that net periodic pension cost will decrease by approximately in the majority of the other postretirement benefits expenses relate to postretirement healthcare obligations and we expect that net periodic benefit costs for these postretirement benefits will increase by approximately in  as our healthcare premium increases have remained high 
our healthcare costs exclusive of the postretirement healthcare plan costs mentioned above for current active employees increased approximately during as a result of sharp increases in premiums over the prior year 

table of contents in addition  during  we renegotiated a contract for our outsourced operational support systems oss  which resulted in a savings of approximately per month at the time the new contract was signed 
expenses pursuant to this contract were not materially different in over due to the fact that the first full month of savings did not occur until september of oss expenses prior to that date had increased year over year pursuant to the growth in access lines and access line equivalents part of the contracted fee structure is variable and increases with customer growth 
however  for  we expect year over year costs to decrease as a result of a full twelve months at the lower contracted rates 
the increase in consolidated depreciation and amortization expenses of  or  was the result of an increase in the depreciable asset base gross property  plant and equipment of over the course of the past year 
furthermore  a higher ratio of the new additions reflected data centric equipment  which has shorter useful lives than our average depreciable base 
during  we expect that our depreciation expense growth rate will trend at an approximate range of versus the growth rate experienced in this decrease in the depreciation expense growth rate is primarily a result of the capitalized costs and license fees  incurred with the conversion to a year compliant oss approximately five years ago  becoming fully depreciated in december of the increase in state and local taxes of  or  was attributable to increases in a variety of taxes  including the public utility realty tax assessment purta tax  gross receipts tax which grows as intrastate revenues increase  capital stock tax  and payroll related taxes 
overall  the increase in total operating revenues of  coupled with the increase in total operating expenses of  resulted in a  or  increase in net operating income in as compared to other items interest expense decreased  during due to the prepayment of our rural telephone bank rtb notes in december of and the continued scheduled pay down of our remaining federal financing bank ffb notes 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we incurred a charge associated with the accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs related to the rtb debt prepayment 
interest income decreased during due to lower average temporary investment balances during the year  as a result of the rtb debt prepayment  as well as the general decrease in short term money market rates for temporary investments 
equity income of affiliated companies increased during due to overall improved operating results in our affiliated companies  which consist of investments in three wireless partnerships and in boulevard 
the growth rate in this category was lower than in prior years  partially due to a decrease in equity income from our rsa i partnership during this decrease was a result of conversion costs incurred with the transition of the majority partnership interest from alltel communications to verizon wireless during  increases in network investments and much higher customer growth in the last two quarters  which resulted in temporary decreases in income due to higher up front customer acquisition costs  such as equipment subsidies and commissions 
the  change in sundry income expense  net was due to two main factors  a increase in dividend income in the current year and  of costs expended by the company in the prior year exploring strategic alternatives and business arrangements which were not incurred in in addition  the prior year included an investment loss of associated with the other than temporary decline in value of several equity securities 
with respect to the dividend income increase of  as a result of the prepayment of the rtb notes in december of we were able during january of to 
table of contents convert our rtb class b stock into class c stock a class of stock eligible for cash dividends 
as we held the class c stock for nine months of the rtb s twelve month fiscal year  we received a pro rated cash dividend of in the fourth quarter of results of operations vs 
net income for was  or 
per share  compared to net income of  or 
per share  for the increase in net income was attributable to the following factors operating revenues total operating revenues increased  or  during this increase was the result of increases in local network services revenues of   long distance and access services revenues of  and other operating revenues of   offset partially by a decrease in directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of and a minimal decrease in telecommunication equipment sales of increases in local network services revenues of  or  were primarily attributable to the following factors local dial tone revenues increased  during the increase was partially a result of total access lines including clec growing by  lines  or  from  access lines as of december  to  access lines as of december  more specifically  the total growth was a result of an  access line increase in our edge out markets offset partially by a  access line decrease in our ilec market 
also contributing to the increase was north pittsburgh s chapter filing with the pa puc in december of as a result of this revenue neutral filing  we increased local rates in our ilec market  with a corresponding offset occurring through a decrease in intrastate access rates 
the revenue shift from long distance and access services revenues to local network services revenues was approximately  for revenues earned from pris increased during  mostly as a result of an increase in the number of circuits in our edge out markets from as of december  to as of december  vertical feature revenues increased by during  mostly as a result of the total growth in access lines 
the change in long distance and access services revenues of  or  was primarily attributable to the following factors special access revenues increased  during  primarily as a result of large increases in the number of ds and ds circuits sold 
access revenues decreased approximately  principally as a result of the north pittsburgh chapter filing which  as previously described  shifted approximately  from intrastate access revenues to local network services revenues 
this shift was partially offset by an increase in mous and end user interstate access charges generated by the growth in access lines and switched circuits 
toll revenues decreased due to the loss of mous to competitors  such as wireless  and to alternative communication technologies such as email 
in addition  the average billed rate for existing customers declined due to increased subscriptions to lower cost 
table of contents calling plans which were developed over the past several years to meet the competitive environment 
the growth in our customer base  mostly through the successful bundling of toll in our edge out markets  was not enough to offset the declining revenue per subscriber 
the increase in other operating revenues of  or  was primarily due to the growth in dsl revenues of approximately  as combined dsl lines both wholesale and retail increased from  as of december  to  as of december  this increase was partially offset by higher write offs associated with carrier bankruptcies  most notably worldcom and global crossing 
the decrease in directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of  or  was mostly due to a decrease of in directory advertising revenue and a decrease of in carrier billing and collection revenues 
directory advertising revenues for decreased from  in annual revenue in to  in annual revenue for our five year agreement with a former directory partner expired with the directory 
because the terms proposed by the former directory partner for the next contract greatly decreased our share of the income generated by the directory  we negotiated a five year contract with a new partner  at terms much more advantageous to us 
however  as the former partner continued to publish its directory  the competitive environment increased  resulting in lower revenues generated by our directory 
with respect to carrier billing and collection revenues  we have contracts with several ixcs and other telecommunications companies under which we earn fees for performing billing and collection services on behalf of these companies 
the volume of services and calls billed on behalf of these companies decreased  mostly as a result of companies bringing these functions in house and a decrease in overall message volume for those carriers remaining with us  due to such factors as wireless substitution 
operating expenses and net operating income total operating expenses increased  or  during the change was primarily the result of increases in network and other operating expenses of  state and local taxes of  depreciation and amortization expenses of and telecommunications equipment expenses of 
the increase in network and other operating expenses of  or  was due to increases in the direct costs associated with the growth in access lines and access line equivalents 
such direct costs include the fees paid for leasing unes in the portions of our edge out markets that we do not provision over our own facilities  fees paid to terminate the increased local  toll and internet traffic generated by our growing customer base and overall general increases in sales and support areas 
the increase in costs  though  was historically low in comparison to the revenue growth rate due to the impact of the following items  which were not directly related to our incremental costs to service our customer base we incurred an approximate charge in for expensing of operational support system evaluation charges in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
no such costs were incurred during we incurred an approximate charge during to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or market 
our results reflected in nauticom sports network nsn restructuring charges as compared to a minor reversal of a restructuring expense in although the nsn was closed in december of  several contracts were settled during for 
table of contents higher amounts than originally accrued for in the restructuring reserve and other miscellaneous charges were incurred during during  we had a increase in performance assurance payments received from verizon  which are recorded as a reduction in operating expenses 
the four above mentioned items were partially offset by the net periodic benefit costs for our pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans increasing and  respectively  in over the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of  or  was the result of the increase in the depreciable asset base gross property  plant and equipment of over the increase in state and local taxes of  or  was mostly attributable to a increase in public utility realty tax assessment purta expense in as included a favorable settlement of previous years overpayments 
overall  the increase in total operating revenues of  coupled with the increase in total operating expenses of  resulted in a increase in net operating income in as compared to other items interest expense increased in by due to the accelerated amortization of of debt issuance costs related to the prepayment of the rtb notes in december of interest income decreased in due to the liquidation of available for sale debt securities in april of and the general decrease in short term money market rates for temporary investments 
equity income of affiliated companies increased  during due to improved results from our investments in three wireless partnerships 
the increase in sundry expense  net for was primarily due to an increase in costs expended by the company in exploring strategic alternatives and business arrangements 
associated costs totaled  during as compared to incurred in in addition  we recorded in an investment loss of associated with the other than temporary decline of several equity securities 
liquidity and capital resources december  december  cash and temporary investments working capital long term debt including current maturities cash and temporary investments were  at december  as compared to  at december  the increase was a result of operating cash flows exceeding investment and financing requirements 
cash flows from operations were  for  a  increase from the majority of the increase was a result of net income and non cash charges depreciation increasing 
table of contents  and  respectively  over these factors were offset partially by contributions made to the north pittsburgh retirement plan totaling  during versus in the prior year 
the  of contributions to the north pittsburgh retirement plan consisted of the required minimum contribution of made during the first quarter of and an elective additional tax deductible contribution of  made during the second quarter of cash flows used for investing activities were  for  a  decrease from the improvement was mostly a result of an increase of  in in the net proceeds received from our wireless partnerships 
in addition  our capital additions  which were internally financed  totaled  for  a minor  or  decrease from the prior year figure 
we expended  during for financing activities  which included cash dividends and the scheduled repayments of debt and capital lease obligations 
the  decrease in cash expenditures for financing activities from was mostly due to the accelerated retirement of  of rtb notes in december of  which also led to a  reduction in scheduled debt repayments in over temporary excess funds were invested in short term cash equivalents with maturity dates scheduled to coincide with tax payment due dates  debt principal payments  dividend payment dates and other predictable cash needs 
we expect to continue the investment of such excess funds throughout  which should enable us to meet all short term obligations 
working capital levels at december  increased  from december   mostly due to a  increase in cash and temporary investments as discussed above 
the decrease in long term debt was a result of scheduled principal repayments of  in as mentioned above  we funded of our expenditures for property and equipment from operations cash flows and cash reserves 
therefore  no additional advances were requested from our available debt facilities 
in  north pittsburgh was granted approval for a loan from the ffb guaranteed by the rus in the maximum principal amount of  the total amount outstanding at december  to the ffb under this loan was  with all advances having a maturity date of december  the unadvanced amount of this facility as of december  was  north pittsburgh can draw against this facility through june  for qualified capital expenditure projects  as defined in the loan agreement  to furnish and improve telephone service in rural areas 
as of december   north pittsburgh had approximately  of qualified capital expenditures that were eligible to be drawn against this facility 
the notes payable to the ffb are secured by a supplemental mortgage agreement executed by north pittsburgh  which provides that substantially all of the assets of north pittsburgh  which approximate a net book value of  are subject to a lien or a security interest 
such agreement contains restrictions regarding dividends and other distributions by north pittsburgh 
under these restrictions  unless certain working capital levels  net worth levels and interest expense ratios are maintained  north pittsburgh is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock other than in shares of capital stock  or make any other distributions to its shareholder or purchase  redeem or retire any of its capital stock or make any investment in affiliated companies 
as a result of these restrictions  approximately  of north pittsburgh s retained earnings was available for dividends and other distributions to the registrant as of december  taking into consideration the north pittsburgh restrictions  consolidated retained earnings of approximately  were available for dividends and other distributions to our shareholders as of december  north pittsburgh also has available through june of a  line of credit with the rural telephone finance cooperative at a rate of prime plus 
no borrowings have taken place against the line of credit 
we intend to apply for an extension of this line of credit 

table of contents the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and purchase commitments as of december  payments due by period obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total cash obligations represents total minimum lease commitments interest and executory costs are included 
the largest component of the purchase obligations category represents a contract to outsource the majority of our operational support systems 
the contract  which is effective through august of  has terms that make it non cancelable by the company through march of after that date  we have the right to cancel the contract but must pay a termination fee as defined in the contract 
base payments through the term of the contract are expected to be approximately     and  in    and  respectively 
the above mentioned figures are estimates due to the fact that a portion of the fee relating to billing services is variable  as it is partially calculated based on the number of service accounts 
the remaining portion of the purchase obligations category represents various contractual arrangements and purchase commitments that we enter into in the ordinary course of business 
these obligations include purchase orders for capital expenditure plans  network maintenance contracts  multi year contracts for internet backbone services and company advertising sponsorships 
the total of these commitments as of december  approximate  for and for we expect cash flows provided by operating activities and cash reserves over the next twelve months to be sufficient to service long term debt and capital lease obligations  to pay dividends and to finance all capital projects 
we currently expect a capital expenditure program for in the range of  to  we expect to continue to have the necessary cash flows from operations and cash reserves to internally finance of our projected capital expenditures 
however  due to the low cost financing available through the rus for qualified north pittsburgh capital expenditures  we may request advancements from the rus facility in the future 

table of contents critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective or complex judgments 
these policies are as follows revenue recognition revenues are recognized when local network  long distance  and access services are provided 
local service  intrastate long distance and intrastate access service revenues are subject to the jurisdiction of the pa puc 
revenues from equipment sales are recorded after equipment has been installed and accepted by the customer 
directory advertising revenues are recognized ratably over the month period related to the directory publication 
our north pittsburgh subsidiary receives a portion of its interstate access revenues from pooling arrangements in which it participates with other telephone companies 
such pools  which are administrated by neca  are funded by access service charges regulated by the fcc 
revenues earned through these pooling arrangements  which are based on nationwide average costs applied to certain projected demand quantities  are initially recorded based on estimates and are subject to adjustments that may either increase or decrease the final amount of interstate revenues realized for a given period 
management monitors the activity of the pools and establishes accruals  if deemed necessary  for estimated obligations to the pool 
the calculations used to record these revenues are complex and involve a variety of estimates  and it is therefore possible that the ultimate amount realized from the pools could differ materially from our estimates  although historically we have not experienced significant out of period adjustments to our revenues as a result of participating in these pools 
impairment of long lived assets based upon the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
a determination of impairment if any is made based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  prior to this standard  we reviewed our long lived assets according to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we have determined  based on our reviews under the aforementioned standards in the year s in which they were effective  that there had been no impairment to the carrying value of such assets in  or valuation of accounts receivable we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our accounts receivable aging schedules  history of write offs  relationships with our customers and the overall credit worthiness of our customers 
income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits we calculate the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
the key assumptions used in making these calculations are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligation  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
we select discount rates commensurate with current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the expected return on assets is based on our current view of the long term returns on assets held by the plan  which is influenced by the historical performance of plan assets  asset allocation and other third party studies 
the medical cost trend rate is based on our actual medical claims and future projections of medical cost trends 
the judgments used in applying the above policies are based on our evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
worldcom bankruptcy on july   worldcom petitioned the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
during  we realized reductions in revenue of as a result of the write off of pre petition amounts owed by worldcom to penn telecom and also to north pittsburgh for intrastate services 
for interstate services  north pittsburgh was able to submit and recover from the neca pool the majority of the of uncollectible pre petition receivables owed by worldcom 
during march of  we negotiated a claim sale agreement for north pittsburgh s receivables with deutsche bank and achieved a recovery of of the total amount recovered  the which represented a recovery of interstate receivables was remitted back to the neca pool as we had already collected the entire write off from the pool in  resulting in no effect on the income statement 
the which represented a recovery of intrastate receivables was recognized in the income statement as a recovery of revenue during the first quarter of we sold penn telecom s claim for and recognized a recovery of revenue during the fourth quarter of although worldcom had yet to emerge from bankruptcy as of the date of this filing  we do not believe that any material exposure now exists as worldcom currently d b a mci has been promptly paying all post petition invoices 
in addition  we believe that the majority of the worldcom pre petition interstate uncollectibles have been submitted and processed through the neca pool without a material impact experienced on our revenues 
workforce reduction and business restructuring during the second quarter of  we instituted a workforce reduction program at our north pittsburgh subsidiary 
this program  consisting of both layoffs and early retirement incentives  reduced the north pittsburgh workforce by people  or 
we recorded severance charges of  and during the second and third quarters of  respectively 
no severance accrual remained as of december   as all amounts had been paid prior to that date 
because of the workforce reduction program  we also recorded curtailment charges and completed a re measurement of our obligations under our pension and postretirement healthcare plans 
curtailment charges totaling  were recorded in the second quarter of both the  in severance charges and  in curtailment charges were recorded in the network and other operating expenses line item on our consolidated statement of income 

table of contents in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we shut down the nauticom sports network 
the associated restructuring accrual liability was and at december  and  respectively 
the remaining accrual relates solely to future operating lease payments 
we recorded an expense of in and a reversal of expense of in in relation to this accrual 
no income statement adjustments were recorded in regulatory matters both north pittsburgh and penn telecom are subject to regulatory oversight by the pa puc for intrastate services and the fcc for interstate services 
the pa puc and the fcc have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities with respect to service and facilities  rates and charges  securities  the encumbering or disposition of public utility properties  accounting and various other matters 
in  congress passed the act  which has the goal of opening the telecommunications industry to further competition for all services 
the act prohibits state legislative or regulatory restrictions or barriers to entry regarding the provision of local telephone service 
it also requires most ilecs to interconnect with the networks of other telecommunications carriers  unbundle their services into network elements  offer their telecommunications services at wholesale rates in order to permit the resale of such services and allow other telecommunications carriers to locate equipment on their premises 
local exchange telephone carriers are also required to compensate each other for the transport and termination of calls 
the fcc has issued a number of rulemakings that continue to implement the requirements of the act 
the general intent of the act was to open up the local exchange market to competition  including permitting the resale of services at wholesale rates and providing number portability  dialing parity  interconnection to any requesting carrier and access to network elements 
north pittsburgh s wireline operations are considered rural under the act and are exempt from certain of the foregoing obligations unless  in response to a bona fide request for interconnection  the pa puc removes that exemption 
more specifically  pursuant to the rural exemption provision of section f of the act  north pittsburgh is currently exempted from offering collocation  unbundled network elements unes  wholesale discounts and certain other requirements of the act which originally pertained to non rural ilecs 
the rural exemption does not  however  prevent facilities based competition in north pittsburgh s service area 
in addition  on january   the pa puc denied the request of north pittsburgh and other rural carriers in the state of pennsylvania for an extension of a temporary suspension of sections b and c of the act which north pittsburgh and the other rural carriers had held since july  there are two main implications of the denial of the temporary suspension to north pittsburgh 
first  north pittsburgh is now open to the potential removal of its rural exemption if a prospective competitor successfully petitions the pa puc for its removal 
however  the pa puc may grant such a removal only if it finds that the competitor s proposal is not unduly economically burdensome to north pittsburgh  is technically feasible and is consistent with the universal service provisions of the act 
in addition  the burden of proof in such a proceeding rests with the competitor 
second  north pittsburgh became subject to implementing lnp within six months of receipt of a bona fide request from a clec 
in march of  north pittsburgh did receive a request from a clec to negotiate an interconnection agreement 
accompanying the request for interconnection by the clec was a request for lnp 
as a result of that request  north pittsburgh implemented lnp capability in november of north pittsburgh is still in negotiations with the requesting clec in regard to a final interconnection agreement 

table of contents the north pittsburgh implementation of lnp capability coincided with the fcc s ordered deadline for certain ilecs  including north pittsburgh  to implement wireline to wireless lnp by november  on january   the fcc extended the november   deadline until may   for certain rural lecs  however  because north pittsburgh was already lnp capable  this extension did not apply to north pittsburgh 
while the fcc s order regarding wireline to wireless lnp has been challenged in court  the outcome of that court challenge is unknown 
until such time as the court may overturn or remand the issue to the fcc  the requirement of wireline to wireless lnp is applicable to north pittsburgh and penn telecom 
under the current rules  the ability of an end user to transfer his or her wireline number to a wireless phone may cause both north pittsburgh and penn telecom to experience some loss of customers and the associated revenues  because the customer will be able to migrate from wireline service to a wireless service and still retain his or her current telephone number 
the provision of interstate toll and access services by north pittsburgh and penn telecom is subject to the regulatory scrutiny of the fcc 
terms  conditions and rates for interstate toll and access services are filed in interstate tariffs for review and approval by the fcc 
however  since august   the fcc has no longer required non dominant interstate toll providers  including penn telecom  to file tariffs for their interstate toll services 
penn telecom now informs its toll customers of the rates  terms and conditions through written notice 
the provision of intrastate toll and access services is subject to regulatory scrutiny by the pa puc 
terms  conditions and rates for intrastate toll and access services are filed in intrastate tariffs for pa puc review and approval on october   at t corporation  a large ixc  filed a petition with the fcc requesting a declaratory ruling that at t s phone to phone internet protocol ip telephony services are exempt from interstate switched access charges 
the fcc has set forth a pleading cycle for parties to file comments and reply comments 
a number of parties have filed comments in opposition to the filing  including the united states telephone association  of which north pittsburgh is a member 
the fcc is expected to act on the at t petition sometime prior to the end of the second quarter of should the fcc grant at t s petition  both north pittsburgh and penn telecom would be affected by such a ruling 
because the outcome of this proceeding is unknown at this time  we are unable to determine the effect such action may have on our operations and revenues 
on february   the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proceeding to examine the regulatory treatment of voip 
while in the notice the fcc indicated its preference for minimal regulation  it also recognized the need to ensure that the provision of voip is consistent with social objectives including emergency  law enforcement access  consumer protection and disability access 
in that voip services compete directly with the local and toll service offerings of north pittsburgh and penn telecom  the outcome of this proceeding will affect both companies 
because the outcome of this proceeding is unknown at this time  we are unable to determine the effect such action may have on our operations and revenues 
in october of  the fcc adopted an order referred to as the multi association group  or mag order  that modified the interstate access charge rules and universal service support system for rate of return ror ilecs 
north pittsburgh is subject to this order 
according to the fcc  the new rules  which went into effect january   are intended to accomplish the following three goals align the interstate access rate structure more closely with the manner in which costs for access are incurred  replace implicit support for universal service with explicit support that is portable to all eligible telecommunications carriers on a competitively neutral basis  and provide certainty and stability for small and mid sized local telephone companies serving rural and high cost areas by permitting these carriers to continue to set interstate access rates based on a ror of  thereby encouraging investment in rural america 
the mag order had the following effects increased flat rate charges referred to as subscriber line charges slcs that are billed to residential and business customers  and 
table of contents decreased per minute of use switched access charges billed to interexchange toll providers that originate and terminate traffic on an ilec s network 
the mag order also created a new universal service support mechanism  interstate common line support icls 
the icls replaces the carrier common line ccl charge  which was previously billed to interexchange toll providers 
the icls was phased in beginning july of and the ccl was eliminated as of july of the initial effect of the implementation of the mag order on north pittsburgh was revenue neutral 
at the same time the mag order was adopted  the fcc also issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on an incentive regulation plan for ilecs  which are now under ror regulation in the interstate jurisdiction 
because the outcome of this proceeding is not yet known  we are not able to predict the effect that it may have on our operations and revenues 
in an order adopted on february   the fcc merged the long term support lts universal service support mechanism  which was available to only certain ilecs  with the new icls mechanism that was created in the mag order 
according to the fcc  this measure will not affect existing levels of support for ror carriers such as north pittsburgh 
however  because icls was portable to clecs and cmrs providers that are designated as eligible telecommunication carriers etcs  the merged lts icls may also be portable to competing etcs 
in february of  the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the possible classification of wireline broadband internet access as an information service rather than a telecommunications service 
should the fcc adopt this proposed rule  it may cause network based broadband offerings such as dsl services to be more lightly regulated by the fcc 
in the notice of proposed rulemaking  the fcc also asked whether it should extend usf requirements to not only facilities based wireline broadband internet service providers bisps but also wireless  cable tv and satellite bisps 
should the fcc extend a usf contribution requirement to all bisps  north pittsburgh  penn telecom and pinnatech would be affected 
because the outcome of this proceeding is unknown at this time  we are unable to determine the effect such action may have on our operations and revenues 
in february of  the fcc also issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the possible reformation of the system for assessing and recovering usf funds 
in that proceeding  the fcc has asked for comment on whether it should assess carrier contributions based on the number and capacity of connections that contributing carriers provide to customers  rather than on the current method  which is based on the interstate revenues they earn 
should the fcc reform the current system for assessing and recovering usf funds  north pittsburgh  penn telecom and pinnatech would be affected by the change 
because the outcome of this proposal is unknown at this time  we are unable to determine the effect such action may have on our operations and revenues 
on february   the fcc issued its decision regarding the triennial review of the act 
the decision dealt with several issues that may affect north pittsburgh and penn telecom 
generally  it appears that the decision eliminates unbundling requirements for ilecs in regard to broadband services provided over fiber facilities but continues unbundled access to mass market narrowband loops 
in addition  ilecs are not required to unbundle packet switching services 
the fcc further found that the high frequency portion of the loop  also referred to as line sharing  is no longer required to be provided as an une and will therefore be phased out over three years 
additionally  the fcc found that ilecs will no longer have to offer the local switching une to clecs for business customers served by high capacity loops 
the states had days to rebut this finding 
for mass market customers served by narrowband loops  the fcc set out specific criteria that states shall apply to determine if switching should no longer be available as an une 
upon a state ruling eliminating switching as an une for mass market customers  the fcc set forth a three year period for carriers to transition off unbundled network element platform une p  which is a service that bundles une 
table of contents switching with other unes such as une loop to provide the entire local service platform 
the fcc order explaining the decision was released august the pa puc  on october   entered an order which initiated two proceedings to implement the requirements set forth in the fcc s triennial review order tro in a manner specific to pennsylvania 
the first proceeding investigated whether the pa puc should request a waiver from the fcc in regard to the elimination of the requirement that ilecs provide clecs with the local switching une for customers served by high capacity loops 
this proceeding has closed with the pa puc concluding that the proceeding did not apply to incumbents such as north pittsburgh that have a rural exemption and that a fcc waiver should not be requested 
however  verizon remained obligated under a separate state order to continue to provide access to its local switching une 
the second pa puc proceeding dealing with the continued ilec provision of the local switching une to clecs for mass market customers remains pending 
however  on march   the u 
s 
court of appeals for the district of columbia issued a decision in a number of court appeals filed in regard to the fcc s tro 
in that ruling  the court upheld the fcc s rules in regard to their conclusion that ilecs need not unbundle broadband loops provided through the utilization of new technologies such as hybrid fiber coaxial cable and fiber to the home 
the court also agreed with the fcc that ilecs need not provide line sharing 
however  the court vacated and remanded a number of fcc rules regarding the fcc s finding that clecs were impaired without access to certain network elements such as local switching 
in addition  the court vacated the fcc s decision to sub delegate to the state commissions determinations related to mass market switching and dedicated transport elements 
the court also stayed its own decision for days in recognition that certain parties may petition for a rehearing 
the three fcc commissioners that had voted in support of the tro immediately issued a press release stating they would take action to appeal the ruling to the u 
s 
supreme court  while the chairman of the fcc issued a separate release stating that he had directed fcc staff to begin preparing new rules that would comply with the court decision 
the immediate effect of the court ruling is that the pa puc state action in regard to implementing the tro is no longer valid as that authority has been returned to the fcc at the conclusion of the day stay 
we believe that regardless of the outcome there will be no immediate impact on our ilec operations since we are not required to offer unes to competitors as long as we retain our rural exemption 
in regard to our clec operations  because we do not currently utilize line sharing and utilize our own switching for business customers who are served by high capacity loops  the ultimate outcome as to the availability of these network elements will have no effect on our operations or revenues from our existing customer base 
however  our clec began to utilize une p in the third quarter of in the following three capacities to convert approximately existing customers from resale to une p  thereby decreasing the monthly recurring line charge we must pay to the ilec and increasing revenue by allowing us to earn access fees  to provision a portion of new non facilities based customers  which now allows us to decrease our current provisioning process by approximately twenty days as well as more efficiently manage the eventual porting of customers to une loop  and to expand geographically outside our existing collocations without significant capital risk as collocation investments can be deferred until a critical mass of customers is obtained 
as of december   we had approximately  or  of our clec dial tone access lines served utilizing une p 
should changes occur to the current une p environment  either in terms of restricting availability or revising pricing formulas methodologies to allow for price increases  the margin improvement  provision efficiencies and low risk geographical expansion which we are expecting may not be realized 
effective january   under pa puc regulations referred to as chapter  north pittsburgh moved from ror regulation in the intrastate jurisdiction to an alternative form of regulation  which is a price cap plan 
under north pittsburgh s price cap plan  rates for non competitive intrastate services are allowed to increase based on an index that measures economy wide price increases less 
table of contents a productivity offset 
there is no limitation on earnings under this plan 
the terms of the plan also allow north pittsburgh to rebalance rates once each year to allow north pittsburgh to gradually realign its intrastate rate structure on a more rational cost and market basis in order to meet future competition 
in addition  as competition develops in the future  north pittsburgh may file with the pa puc to declare certain services competitive and thereby be freed from all rate regulation for those services 
in return for approval of the alternative form of regulation  north pittsburgh has committed to continue to upgrade its network in the future to ensure that all its customers will have access to broadband services 
on april   north pittsburgh filed its annual price stability mechanism psm compliance filing under its approved price cap plan 
while the application of the psm formula in the plan normally would have required north pittsburgh to reduce some rates for non competitive services  resulting in an annual revenue decrease of approximately  north pittsburgh has proposed that this rate reduction be delayed for months until north pittsburgh recovers those intrastate uncollectible revenues that were experienced in due to the global crossing and worldcom bankruptcies 
exogenous event claims  such as this proposal to recoup intrastate uncollectible losses not generally reflected in the gross domestic product price index  are permitted under the north pittsburgh psm 
various parties have  however  opposed the recovery of these losses 
we expect the pa puc to rule on the filing sometime in the chapter legislation  which enables north pittsburgh to operate under an alternative price cap form of regulation  expired due to legislative sunset procedures on december  however  the pa puc entered an order on january   in which it set forth a statement of policy concluding that under the current public utility code  the approved chapter alternative plans of regulation for all ilecs operating in pennsylvania would remain in effect and would be fully enforceable in all respects upon the ilecs after the sunset date of december  competing versions of new proposed legislation reauthorizing and revising the chapter regulations have been introduced in both the pennsylvania house and senate 
legislative action reauthorizing chapter  with some revisions  is expected by the end of because the outcome of this legislative initiative is unknown at this time  we are unable to determine the effect that any new legislation reauthorizing chapter will have on our operations and revenues 
it is our understanding that north pittsburgh will remain under its current chapter plan until such time as the pa puc orders changes in the plan and or the legislature acts to authorize new chapter legislation 
transactions with related parties in  we entered into an agreement to outsource certain data processing functions to a third party processor processor  which is a member of the armstrong group 
we are related to the armstrong group by a common shareholder and director 
payments to the processor under this agreement were   and  in  and  respectively 
during  and  we paid approximately  and  respectively  to the law firm of a member of the board of directors for various legal services 
as of december   we had amounts of and outstanding to the processor and law firm  respectively 
as of december   we had amounts of and outstanding to the processor and law firm  respectively 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  we both provide and receive telecommunication transport services from boulevard  a competitive access provider jointly owned by us and a company in the armstrong group 
total revenues recognized from providing services to boulevard were approximately  and  and total expenses incurred from receiving services from boulevard were approximately  and  for  and  respectively 
we also provide  in the ordinary course of business  telecommunication and transport services to other member companies of the armstrong group  with total revenues recognized of approximately  and  for 
table of contents  and  respectively 
the amounts outstanding from and or due boulevard and the companies in the armstrong group were negligible as of december  and regulatory assets we do not believe that we have any significant regulatory assets or liabilities under sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
historically  we have monitored closely the economic lives of plant in service and have adjusted depreciable lives as necessary to conform to generally accepted accounting principles 
recent accounting pronouncements in july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the pronouncement was effective for our fiscal year beginning january  as of december   we had a net book value of in equity method goodwill recorded under investments as the result of the purchase of an additional interest in the pennsylvania rsa ii limited partnership in september of sfas no 
discontinues the amortization of equity method goodwill and prescribes that we continue to test for impairment in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion we noted no impairment during our review of the equity method goodwill and associated investment during and as the annual amortization of the goodwill before the adoption of sfas no 
was only  the cessation of the amortization did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that we record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the assets 
we would also record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in thousands our limited exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we primarily enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures 
we currently have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for long term debt obligations  as all our long term debt obligations contain fixed rates 
as of december   we had debt obligations of  with an average interest rate of and maturity dates of december  based on borrowing rates currently available for loans with similar terms and maturities  the estimated fair value of our long term debt as of december  was  our only exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates would be in the event that we prepay our debt  at which time a debt premium or discount would be calculated based on current rus borrowing rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio or for any other purpose
