executive overview ask jeeves offers advanced internet search technology to the public through advertiser supported sites on the world wide web which is known as the web 
we seek to attract web traffic by creating a distinctive search experience that users will find more intuitive and satisfying than other search alternatives 
on our flagship web sites  ask 
com in the us and ask 
co 
uk in the uk  users submit ask jeeves  inc 
table of contents their search requests  and our algorithmic search technology  teoma  delivers a list of web pages likely to contain relevant and authoritative answers 
the results page also displays advertiser sponsored links known as paid listings to related products and services 
we operate four proprietary web sites dedicated to search ask 
com  ask 
co 
uk  teoma 
com and ajkids 
com 
we also deliver  or syndicate  our search technology and advertising products to approximately third party web sites as of december   including portals  infomediaries  and content and destination web sites 
we provide search results and or advertising for those web sites to display in response to their users search queries 
we refer to these third party web sites as our syndication network 
our focus is on increasing our web traffic ie  of the number of search queries on our proprietary web sites by attracting more users and getting them to use our search services more frequently 
we generate advertising revenue every time users click on the paid listings  or as a result of graphic advertising and other advertising products we deliver in response to their queries 
in this way  we monetize a portion of our web traffic 
we also earn revenue by licensing our search technology to our japanese joint venture and to some of the sites in our syndication network 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which are known as gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions were made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
our accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results include those relating to revenue  allowances for doubtful accounts  legal contingencies  and accounting for income taxes 
each of these critical accounting policies is described in more detail below 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also cases which require management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives but none of the alternatives would produce a materially different result 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue continuing operations we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
if we have doubt about the collectibility of ask jeeves  inc 
table of contents revenue at the time it is earned  such revenue is deferred until cash has been received 
revenues are generated from four general sources sales of premier listings and other paid placement products  sales of branded advertising products  sales of paid inclusion products  and licensing of our search technologies 
our premier listings and other paid placement products are textual  or web links  that are designed to connect users interested in a particular product or service with an advertiser offering that product or service at the exact moment users need the information  much like a yellow pages listing 
with these products  advertisers pay only for performance  so these revenues are generated when a user clicks on the link to the advertiser s web site on a cost per click  or cpc  basis 
we recognize cpc revenue on a revenue sharing basis if the paid placement was procured from our third party provider 
our branded advertising ranges from highly targeted graphic units  which we offer as our branded response product  to traditional advertising units such as banners  towers and interstitials  which appear primarily on our syndicated sites 
branded advertising is generally sold on a cost per impression  or cpm  basis with the revenue derived from such arrangements recognized during the period that the service is provided  provided that no significant obligations remain outstanding from us to the advertiser at the end of the period 
our obligations typically include a guaranteed minimum number of impressions or times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our online properties 
to the extent the minimum guaranteed impressions are not delivered  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenue until the remaining guaranteed impression levels are achieved 
our paid inclusion products provide an opportunity for web sites to ensure that they are included in our search index 
we recognize paid inclusion revenue in two ways 
first  on a per url basis  in which the revenues are collected in advance and recognized over the appropriate service period  which is typically one year  and second on a cpc basis  in which the revenue is recognized when the click is delivered 
license payments received from our japanese joint venture were initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenues on a straight line basis over a four year period 
the license revenue will terminate after the second quarter of our syndication services include the sale of advertising and paid placement products  and the licensing of our search technology to third party web sites 
syndication license fees primarily arise from revenue sharing arrangements  fixed fee arrangements or fee per use arrangements  and revenues are recognized as the service is delivered 
we allocate our syndication revenues among our four revenue categories  paid placement  branded advertising  paid inclusion  and license fees  as applicable  when reporting our results 
revenues from revenue sharing arrangements are recorded gross  including amounts paid to syndication partners  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 because we act as the primary obligor in the arrangement  perform a significant portion of the service  have latitude in establishing pricing and bear credit risk 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are ask jeeves  inc 
table of contents provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we also record a provision for revenue adjustments in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical analysis of credit memo data and other factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future uncollectible revenue  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be impacted 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of our material legal proceedings 
income taxes we use significant judgment in determining our consolidated income tax provision 
uncertainties may arise with respect to the tax treatment of certain transactions  transfer pricing arrangements among related entities  and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  we cannot be certain that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
due to uncertainty surrounding when or if we will realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets primarily from our net operating loss carryforwards  we have recorded a valuation allowance on such amounts 
any decrease in the valuation allowance could materially reduce our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
we provide for united states income taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely invested outside the united states 
at december   the cumulative earnings upon which united states income taxes have not been provided are approximately million 
the income tax that would arise if these items were repatriated is approximately million  some or all of which may be reduced by nols or foreign tax credits

table of contents results of operations on may   we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets used in our jeeves solutions division to kanisa inc kanisa

revenues year ended dollars in thousands change change total revenues for grew as compared with generally  revenues were favorably affected by increased usage of our web sites  which we refer to as our web traffic  which increased in both the us and us in particular  queries on our proprietary sites exhibited strong growth  increasing over contributing to the growth in queries  average user site visit frequency per month on ask 
com increased throughout the year  to in the fourth quarter of as compared with in the same period of we believe the increase in frequency and growth in queries are a reflection of our focus during on improving our search technology and creating a differentiated site experience 
during  we continued to invest in teoma  our search technology  increasing the size of the index that is used to search for results from million sites to billion sites 
we also made enhancements to the site  including the introduction of what we call smart search features 
smart search includes such features as weather  stock and products 
we believe that smart search helps users find information more quickly and intuitively by delivering results directly  rather than requiring the user to click on a separate tab or link to get them 
we believe that these investments in site and technology combine to establish our sites as a differentiated alternative for searching the web 
our revenues are related to our internet search services and to our syndication of web search services to third party web sites 
our revenues consist of four main categories sales of paid placement products  sales of branded advertising products  paid inclusion products  and licensing

the revenue is recognized ratably over the estimated service period applicable to this arrangement 
the license revenue will terminate after the second quarter of our paid inclusion product continued its steady growth trend  matching the overall growth of the company  and contributed approximately two percent of our revenues 
throughout  we began making investments in technology  products and in our web sites  with the overall goals of improving relevance of our search answers and user satisfaction 
we believe that these investments resulted in the significant growth in revenues in the us and  combined with our ask jeeves  inc 
table of contents acquisition of full ownership over our former joint venture in the uk  to produce overall revenue growth as compared with paid placement revenues increased in from those in as we had improvement in both unit volumes and unit pricing 
additionally  we benefited from improved revenue sharing terms from one of our paid placement partners 
total advertising revenues grew for from those in due to the acquisition of our uk joint venture 
uk revenue decreased slightly in as the market demand for traditional online advertising products remained soft 
our paid inclusion product  which was launched in the first quarter of  contributed approximately one percent of our revenues 
this product showed strong growth on a percentage basis every quarter during the year  from a small base 
for  we intend to seek revenue growth by increasing traffic to our web sites  and by increasing the price we charge for our products and services 
we intend to seek increased web traffic by improving the relevance of our search results and  thereby  increasing user satisfaction 
during  we made improvements to the site to make it cleaner  faster and easier to use 
further  we plan to increase our marketing efforts to users  which we initiated during we expect to add more features during  which we believe will improve the site experience 
we believe that these steps  combined with improvements to the user experience  will lead to growth in traffic of our web sites 
gross margin year ended dollars in thousands change change gross profit gross margin cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to traffic acquisition for our syndicated sites and the delivery of our search results 
costs to acquire traffic for our syndicated sites include revenue based payments and similar arrangements with third parties who direct traffic to those sites 
costs related to delivering our search results include depreciation of web site equipment  hosting and ad server management  salaries and related personnel costs and amortization charges related to technology acquired in some of our business combinations 
gross margin increased in due to the increase in revenue  which grew faster than costs 
on a dollar basis  cost of revenues increased million to million in as compared with  reflecting increased traffic acquisition costs associated with the higher levels of traffic  partially offset by decreases in compensation related costs and facilities charges relating to our restructuring activities 
for as compared with  gross margin increased due to both an increase in revenues and a decrease in cost of revenues

to date  all software development costs have been expensed as incurred 
product development expenses increased on a dollar basis in as compared with due to compensation related expenses increases as we grew our research and development team in order to expand our teoma technology and add new features on our web sites 
higher compensation related expenses were partially offset by a reduction in the use of consultants for product development activities 
decreased compensation related costs and the use of consultants comprise the majority of the dollar decrease in over  and resulted from our focus on key  strategic areas of product development to support our business plan and a reduction in the number of product development initiatives that were not essential to delivering future financial results 
we focused on the following strategic areas for grow and optimize revenue o improving the perceived relevance of revenue products o enhancing operational efficiency via technology improvements deliver smarter results o enhancing navigation and usability features o growing portfolio of smart answer functionality o driving site performance improvements o expanding index to deliver improved coverage o introducing industry leading index update cycles o expanding algorithmic search capabilities o improving query understanding through application of national language processing technologies during  we expect to continue to invest in product development 
we plan to make product enhancements such as additional smart search features and other changes to the site that we believe will yield higher traffic volumes over time 
as a result  we expect product development costs to increase on a dollar basis in compared to ask jeeves  inc 
table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising  promotional and public relations expenditures  as well as salaries  commissions and related personnel expenses of our sales force 
on a dollar basis  sales and marketing spending increased for compared to in we launched several marketing campaigns including print ads  radio spots  and online and out of home advertising 
these marketing campaigns were focused on promoting both branding and traffic generation 
further  as revenue grew in compared to  we saw an increase in sales commissions and other incentive compensation 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in compared with reflects cost cutting measures in variable spending areas including advertising  promotional programs and public relations  which was partially offset in by slightly higher sales commissions reflecting the increased revenues

also  general and administrative salaries and incentive compensation increased as we expanded headcount to manage the growing business and rewarded employees for the company s performance 
relative to  expenses were lower in primarily due to decreased salary and incentive compensation charges  decreased use of outside consultants and decreased charges for doubtful accounts receivable  partially offset by increased costs for insurance and legal expenses 
in we anticipate general and administrative expenses to continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue  but increase on a dollar basis

additionally  during  we recorded impairment charges totaling  primarily related to acquired intangible assets of the discontinued e tours product 
during the first quarter of  we identified indicators of possible impairment of our long lived assets  consisting principally of acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
we measured the impairment loss related to long lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amount of such assets exceeded its fair value 
the analysis indicated that our long lived assets were impaired by an amount totaling million 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment write down  allocated to goodwill  of this amount 
restructuring costs during  we implemented restructuring actions to better align our cost structure with our current and anticipated levels of business activities 
those actions resulted in restructuring charges related to workforce reductions 
there were no similar charges during during the year ended december   we reported charges of approximately million  which included approximately million related to facility consolidations in california  as a result of unsuccessful attempts to sublease in a rapidly deteriorating market which led to our decision to terminate a significant lease obligation for a termination fee

ask jeeves  inc 
table of contents interest and other income  net interest income relates primarily to interest earned on fixed income securities and correlates with the average balance of those investments and prevailing interest rates 
interest expense arises primarily from interest accruing on outstanding borrowings under our line of credit and under our capital lease 
interest income was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income in over is due to the amortization of our capitalized issuance costs related to the convertible subordinated notes we sold in  which are netted against interest income 
amortization of these costs totaled  for without including this amortization  interest income in increased  from as our average balance of funds held in interest earning investments increased 
net proceeds from the sale of the convertible subordinated notes are being held in marketable securities 
the decrease in interest income in over relates to decreases in both average balances and prevailing interest rates during the year 
interest expense was  for the year ended december    for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  during we repaid the outstanding borrowings under our line of credit  and paid off the remaining obligation under our capital lease

loss from discontinued operations on july   we completed the sale of certain assets used in our jeeves solutions business to kanisa  inc pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated may   by and between us and kanisa 
accordingly  the results of operations relating to this division have been reclassified in our statements of operations as a discontinued operation 
during  we recorded a gain of million representing the excess of the purchase consideration received at closing over the book value of the assets sold  as well as the remaining amount of deferred license fees applicable to jeeves solutions 
in exchange for the sale of such assets  we received million in cash at the closing and a promissory note for up to  which is payable  subject to certain set off provisions  one year from the date of closing 
the amount payable under the note is currently expected to be approximately  and is subject to certain upward or downward adjustments  but in no event shall the amount payable under the note exceed  the proceeds  if any  from the promissory note will be recorded as additional gain on the transaction upon receipt 
total revenues related to the discontinued operations were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the assets and liabilities of jeeves solutions as of december  have been classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets and the results of operations have been reclassified as loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for all dates and periods presented 
we recorded a loss on discontinued operations of million during operating expenses decreased million from  primarily from our cost cutting efforts 
further  revenues in were million compared to million in as a result of the sale of the division on july  ask jeeves  inc 
table of contents  we only recorded six months of revenue compared to the twelve months of revenue we recorded in during  we recorded a loss on discontinued operations of million  as compared with a loss in of million 
the decrease in loss results from our cost cutting efforts as we worked to align the spending levels for the division with expected operational needs 
the decrease in spending was partially offset by a decrease in revenue  as noted above 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations in operating results our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that may adversely affect our results of operations include our ability to attract and retain advertisers and our ability to link our partners to potential customers  the number of queries on our web sites  our ability to effectively manage our advertising inventory  rate changes for advertising on our web sites  marketing expenses and technology infrastructure costs as well as other costs that we may incur as we expand our operation  seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for our services and for advertising space on our web sites  our ability to develop and introduce new technology  announcements and new technology introductions by our competitors  our ability to attract and retain key personnel  and costs relating to possible acquisitions and integration of technologies or businesses  because of the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
as internet advertising continues the transition from an emerging to a more developed market  seasonal and cyclical patterns may develop in our industry that may also affect our revenues 
similar to traditional media  this may result in our advertising sales being lower during the summer vacation period 
additionally  the seasonality of traffic on our proprietary sites corresponds with overall internet usage 
this may result in lower usage during holidays and the summer vacation period  as less people use the internet 
seasonality in the retail industry and in internet service usage is likely to cause quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations and could harm our business

partially offsetting these inflows was our repayment of million of borrowings under our line of credit 
we have a revolving line of credit with a bank in the amount of million 
the line of credit expires on july  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at libor plus 
all borrowings and letters of credit are collateralized by an equal amount of our marketable securities

we may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date 
our existing cash and marketable securities balances may decline during in the event of a weakening in our business or changes in our planned cash outlays 
however  based upon our current business plan and revenue prospects  we anticipate that our existing cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in the section risk factors 
additionally  cash and marketable securities balances may be used to fund strategic acquisitions of other companies  products or technologies that are complimentary to our business 
on an ongoing basis  we will need to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures  and repayment of our convertible notes if not converted into stock  or we will need to raise additional capital 
however  if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us  these failures could seriously harm our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced

recent accounting pronouncements in january the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation defines variable interest entities as those in which equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities with out additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or entities in which equity investors lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interests in an entity 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the financial position and results of operations of the variable interest entity 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  issued revisions to fasb interpretation  resulting in multiple effective dates based on the characteristics as well as the creation dates of the variable interest entities  however with no effective date later than our first quarter of we do not believe that the adoption of fasb interpretation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulleting no 
revenue recognition sab  which updates and summarizes the commissions views on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we believe that our revenue recognition policies conform to the requirements of sab ask jeeves  inc 
table of contents risk factors included below are risk factors that may affect our future operating results 
risks related to our company we have a history of net losses and might not remain profitable 
although we first became profitable in the fourth quarter of  and were profitable during  as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we cannot assure that we will remain profitable or cash flow positive 
moreover  we might not be able to increase our operating profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
to increase profits  we will need to generate revenue growth from our advertising sales while continuing to control our expenses 
during the period  we took steps to control costs  including business realignment and a reduction in our workforce 
these measures reduced our operating costs in earlier periods but might yet result in long term problems  such as delayed product development or reduced morale  which could be expensive and difficult to remedy 
moreover  we might be unable to reduce operating costs any further and we face the risk that our costs might increase substantially in the future 
indeed  we believe it is critical that we continue to expend financial and management resources to develop our brand loyalty through marketing and promotion  to enhance our search technologies and to expand our other services 
if we fail to attract web traffic or control costs  our annual net losses could resume  in which case we would eventually need to obtain additional financing or cease operations 
we derive a significant percentage of our revenue from our paid placement arrangement with google  inc in july  we entered into an agreement with google  inc  to participate in its sponsored links program  and our participation began in september under this agreement  google sells paid placements to tens of thousands of advertisers and we display their paid placements on our us web properties 
we also syndicate google s paid placements  together with our search results  to third party web sites in our syndication network 
in exchange for making our web traffic available to google s advertisers  we share in the revenue generated from those advertisers 
in the second quarter of  the ask jeeves uk partnership  our uk subsidiary  entered into an agreement with a google subsidiary to display google s paid placements on our uk web site  replacing a previous paid placement provider 
for the year ended december   our combined paid listings revenues from google comprised of our revenues from continuing operations  and of revenues from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of our us agreement with google is scheduled to terminate in september but allows for termination for convenience by either party during september or october of  and our uk agreement with google is scheduled to terminate in may if our contracts with google are not renewed  or if google fails to perform under these contracts or if they are terminated for any other reason  we would need to find another suitable paid placement provider or otherwise replace the lost revenues 
although alternate paid placement providers such as yahoo inc and espotting media findwhat 
com are currently available in the market  the paid placement market is consolidating  for example  espotting media is merging with findwhat 
com  and we face the risk that we might be unable to negotiate equally advantageous terms with such providers 
further  if google s performance under these contracts unexpectedly deteriorates or our ability to generate traffic for paid placements decreases  our results of operations could be harmed 
web based business models are still evolving 
our advertising revenue will depend on our ability to achieve  measure and demonstrate to advertisers the breadth of web traffic using our search service and the value of our targeted advertising 
currently  ask jeeves  inc 
table of contents there are a variety of pricing models for selling advertising on the internet  including models based on the number of impressions delivered  the number of click throughs by users  the duration over which the advertisement is displayed or the number of keywords to which the advertisement is linked 
it is still difficult to predict which pricing model  if any  will emerge as the industry standard 
in addition  technological changes could impact the success of particular business models 
this uncertainty makes it difficult to project our long term advertising rates and revenues 
a decrease in advertising or further cuts in advertising rates would reduce our total revenue 
we rely on doubleclick for third party advertising delivery 
we rely on third party advertising services  provided by doubleclick  inc to deliver advertisements to our users 
doubleclick is currently the only provider available in the market that meets our delivery needs 
if doubleclick fails to deliver advertisements as contracted for  due to reliability or performance problems  or if advertisements cannot be targeted as promised to advertisers  our revenues may decrease 
both the us and europe doubleclick  inc agreements will expire on february  if we cannot maintain the popularity of our search engine among internet users  our business will fail 
we will be successful only if a critical mass of internet users adopt our search technologies and services as a method of navigating the internet 
internet users have a variety of other search techniques  including other search engines and subject matter directories  available to them to find information on the web 
users can also use non web based methods of obtaining information through the internet  including chat rooms and e mail  rather than browsing through web sites 
our search technologies  including our teoma technology  are novel 
it is difficult to predict the rate at which users will sample our services and the extent to which they will adopt them as their search technology 
even in the case of repeat users  it is difficult to know whether they return to our web sites because they are satisfied with our offerings or because they are dissatisfied with the alternatives 
at any time  users of our services might revert to prior search techniques or choose new search techniques altogether 
we cannot assure you that widespread acceptance of our search technologies and services will occur 
if we cannot maintain the popularity of our search engine among internet users  our business plan will fail 
if high quality  third party data ceases to be available  or directly accessible  on the web  our business might fail 
our internet search services are designed to directly link users to a page within a third party web site that contains an answer to the user s question 
we have little control over the content of these third party web sites 
if these third party web sites do not contain high quality  up to date information  the utility of our service to the user will be reduced 
in addition  when our search engine attempts to direct the user to a page within a third party company s web site  the company administering the site sometimes automatically redirects users to that company s own home page 
if third party companies prevent us from directly linking our users to pages within their web sites  and if there are no comparable alternative web sites to which we can direct our users  the utility and attractiveness of our services to users will be reduced 
if the utility of our services diminishes for either of the above reasons  traffic on our web sites will likely fall  which would reduce our ability to charge for advertising and premium listings

table of contents if we fail to compete effectively against our current and potential competitors  we will lose market share 
we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
many of our competitors are bringing new search technologies to market  allocating extensive resources to product development and marketing and expanding their search offerings 
we compete with search destinations  portals  and search technology providers 
search destinations and portals 
in our efforts to attract search engine users  we compete against search destinations and portals such as google  inc  yahoo inc  america online aol and microsoft network msn  and other smaller companies 
search technology providers 
we also compete with search technology providers such as google  inc  yahoo inc  and other smaller companies 
some of our existing competitors as well as potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial resources than we do 
moreover  vertical integration appears to be increasing in the internet search and advertising industry 
for example  in  yahoo acquired inktomi and other search technology providers  and overture inc  a provider of search services  paid placements and related advertising 
vertically integrated search providers  like yahoo inc and google  inc  might have greater resources and functionality  and might be able to inhibit our access to advertisers or end users 
we face the risk that operating system companies  isps or broadband providers may block or inhibit our ability to connect with our end users 
if our competitors successfully divert search users away from our web sites  we might lose market share 
our growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain new users through effective promotional campaigns 
we believe that favorable consumer and business community perceptions of the ask jeeves brands are essential to our future success 
accordingly  we intend to continue pursuing brand enhancement strategies  which may include mass market and multimedia advertising  promotional programs and public relations activities 
as with any public awareness campaign  we face the risk that our expenditures might not lead to the desired result  that is we might experience no net increase in our brand recognition or brand loyalty  our number of new users  or our web site traffic 
furthermore  even if such increases occur  they might not be sufficiently large to justify the expenditures 
if we are unable to promote brand awareness and loyalty in a cost effective manner  we are unlikely to attract new users and our existing user base might shrink through attrition 
if we are unable to develop new products and new product enhancements rapidly and successfully  as well as to integrate acquired technologies  we might be unable to maintain user satisfaction 
in the highly competitive  consolidating  and rapidly changing internet search environment  our future success depends in large part on our ability to develop or acquire and introduce new search technology that meets the needs of our users more rapidly than our competitors  several of which are larger and may have significantly greater resources available for such investment in technology 
for example  in we acquired teoma technologies  inc and in we acquired technology from octopus software  inc if we are unable to rapidly and successfully develop  acquire  or integrate new technology into the search services we offer  we might lose market share to our faster competitors and never recoup our development or acquisition costs

table of contents our past acquisitions and any future acquisitions may disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value  divert management attention or be difficult to integrate 
we have acquired a number of companies and technologies since our initial public offering  including teoma technologies  inc in september and full ownership of ask jeeves uk partnership in february we may in the future seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses  products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in addition  we may spend significant management time and costs in dealing with acquisitions that do not come to fruition 
however  in doing so  we may encounter problems with the assimilation of acquired businesses  products or technologies including difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel  operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and potential disruption of our ongoing business  adverse effects on our existing business relationships with our customers  potential patent or trademark infringement from acquired technologies  adverse effects on our current employees and the inability to retain employees of acquired companies  use of substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price  and dilution of our current stockholders due to issuances of additional securities as consideration for acquisitions 
if we are unable to integrate our acquired companies successfully or to create new or enhanced services  we might not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions 
if we fail to achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions  we might incur increased expenses and experience a shortfall in our anticipated revenues and we might not obtain a satisfactory return on our investment 
in addition  if a significant number of employees of acquired companies fail to remain employed with us  we may experience difficulties in achieving the expected benefits of the acquisitions 
if we fail to maintain effective internal financial and managerial systems  controls and procedures  our results of operations may be harmed 
our past business realignment and reductions in workforce placed a significant strain on our managerial staff  financial controls and operational resources as our employees have assumed greater responsibilities and learned to manage their increased workload with reduced resources 
we continue to evaluate our operational and financial systems and our managerial controls and procedures to determine what additional changes  if any  might help us to manage our current operations better 
we face the risk that our systems  procedures and controls might not be adequate to support our operations or to maintain accountability for our assets 
any such failure could harm our results of operations 
our international operations expose us to additional risks and additional international expansion efforts might lose money 
the company operates a separate web site  located in dublin  ireland  that provides internet search services to its customers in the united kingdom  ireland and elsewhere in europe 
in addition  we hold ask jeeves  inc 
table of contents a interest in ask jeeves japan  a joint venture selling our answers software product  as well as seeking to launch a japanese language search site with japan specific content 
as part of our corporate restructuring in  we terminated our participation in projects seeking to launch versions of our search sites for spanish speaking and australian users 
any further expansion into international markets would require substantial management attention and financial resources 
establishing foreign operations is a significant investment that might not produce desired returns 
like our current foreign operations  any future expansion efforts would be subject to risks associated with international operations  including the impact of business cycles and downturns in economies outside the united states  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections  time and resources required to comply with foreign regulatory requirements  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  potential tax liabilities if our transfer pricing practices are successfully challenged by the tax authorities of the nations in which we operate  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  unanticipated tax costs associated with the cross border use of intangible assets  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in maintaining effective communications with employees and customers due to distance  language and cultural barriers  lower brand recognition for ask jeeves and the jeeves character in non english speaking countries  lower per capita internet usage in many foreign countries  for a variety of reasons including lower disposable incomes  lack of adequate telecommunications and computer infrastructure and concerns regarding online security for e commerce transactions  and competition in international markets from a broad range of competitors 
legal actions may be initiated against us seeking to hold us liable for our links to third party web sites 
our internet search services are designed to link users directly to a page within a third party web site that contains a response to a user s query 
these direct links might expose us to legal actions seeking to hold us liable for the content of those third party web sites 
these actions might claim  for example  that we should be liable for copyright or trademark infringement or other unauthorized actions by the third party web site 
other claims may be based on errors or false or misleading information provided through our web sites  including information deemed to constitute professional advice including legal  medical  financial or investment advice 
other claims may be based on our links to sexually explicit web sites and our provision of sexually explicit advertisements when this content is displayed 
we do not believe that any such claim would have legal merit  but defending against such a legal action could be expensive and distract management 
implementing measures to reduce our exposure to such claims may require us to spend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our service to users

table of contents risks related to operating in our industry the operating performance of computer systems and web servers is critical to our business and reputation 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure due to a computer virus or otherwise  that causes an interruption in our service or a decrease in our responsiveness could result in reduced user traffic on our web sites and reduced revenues for our business 
we have network and server equipment located at metromedia fiber network in california and england  worldcom in massachusetts  cable wireless communications in england  and esat telecommunications ltd  in dublin  ireland 
although we believe that our current back up methods are adequate  we face the risk that our back up servers might fail or might cause an interruption in our service 
we have experienced slower response times and interruptions in service due to malfunction at our hosting facilities and on the internet backbone networks  major software upgrades on our web sites and undetected software defects 
these web site interruptions have lasted for periods ranging from a few minutes to three hours 
in addition  our web sites also could be affected by computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptions 
if we experience outages  frequent or persistent system failures or degraded response times  user satisfaction would decrease  we would likely lose advertising revenues and our reputation and brands could be permanently harmed 
our users depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to our web sites 
each of these types of providers has experienced significant outages in the past and could experience outages  delays and other operating difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster or unanticipated problem at our principal facilities or at the servers that host or backup our systems could cause interruptions or delays in our interactive network or a loss of data 
our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  earthquake and similar events 
we have not developed a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to respond to system failures 
our insurance policies might not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur due to interruptions in our service 
our long term success depends upon the growth and acceptance of internet advertising as an effective alternative to traditional advertising media 
we compete with traditional media including television  radio and print  in addition to other high traffic web sites  for a share of advertisers total advertising expenditures 
we face the risk that advertisers might find internet advertising to be less effective than traditional media at promoting their products or services and may further reduce or eliminate their expenditures on internet advertising 
many potential advertisers and advertising agencies have only limited experience advertising on the internet and have not devoted a significant portion of their advertising expenditures to internet advertising 
acceptance of the internet among advertisers will depend  to a large extent  on the perceived effectiveness of internet advertising and the continued growth of commercial usage of the internet 
filter software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed on a user s computer are available 
it is unclear whether this type of software will become widely accepted  but if it does  it would negatively affect internet based advertising 
our business could be seriously harmed if the market for internet advertising does not continue to grow

computer break ins could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network  which could reduce our ability to retain or attract customers  damage our reputation or subject us to litigation 
we could be subject to denial of service  vandalism and other attacks on our systems by internet hackers 
although we intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent break ins  damage and failures  these security measures might fail 
our insurance coverage might be insufficient to cover losses that result from such events 
if we do not adapt our search services for users of cell phones  pdas and similar devices  we might lose market share as users increasingly use handheld devices to access the internet 
in the coming years  the number of individuals who access the internet through devices other than a personal computer is expected to increase 
these alternative devices include personal digital assistants  known as pdas  cellular telephones and television set top devices 
the low resolution  functionality and memory currently associated with some of these alternative devices might prevent or impede their users from accessing our graphics rich web services 
unless we successfully launch a version of our web search service that is easily accessible through these alternative devices  we face a risk of losing market share if personal computer users migrate toward use of these alternative devices to access the internet 
our ability to remain profitable might depend on continued growth of internet use 
our revenue model depends in large part on the volume of internet user traffic to our web sites 
our business will be harmed if internet usage does not continue to grow or grows at significantly lower rates compared to current trends 
the continued growth of the internet is subject to various risks  many of which are outside our control 
these risks include the following the internet infrastructure might not be able to support the demands placed on it  performance and reliability of the internet might decline as usage grows and disruptions caused by malicious users or hackers increases  locating useful information online might become more difficult as the number of web sites proliferates  causing internet usage rates to decrease or to grow at a decreasing rate  users might hesitate to engage in online commerce because they feel insecure transmitting confidential information  such as credit card numbers  over the internet  and users privacy concerns might lead them to reduce internet use so as to prevent web sites from gathering user information without the user s knowledge or consent 
our business might suffer if any of our key executives discontinues employment with us 
our future success depends to a large extent on the services of our key managerial employees 
although we have signed offer letters with our executives  we have not entered into formal employment agreements with them and we do not maintain key person life insurance

if we fail to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  our business will be harmed 
we may face potential liability  loss of users and damage to our reputation for violation of privacy policies 
we have a policy against using personally identifiable information obtained from users of our search technologies without the user s permission 
in the past  the federal trade commission has investigated companies that have used personally identifiable information without permission or in violation of a stated privacy policy 
under the uk data protection act and the eu data protection directive  a failure to ensure that personal information is accurate and secure or a transfer of personal information to a country without adequate privacy protections could result in criminal or civil penalties 
if we use personally identifiable information without permission or in violation of our policy  we may face potential liability for invasion of privacy for compiling and providing information to our corporate customers and electronic commerce merchants 
government regulation and legal uncertainties could harm our business 
any new law or regulation pertaining to the internet  or the application or interpretation of existing laws  could decrease the demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise seriously harm our business 
there is  and will likely continue to be  an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet 
these laws or regulations may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  online content regulation  user privacy  taxation and the quality of products and services 
furthermore  the growth and development of electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on electronic commerce companies as well as companies like us that provide electronic commerce services 
we file tax returns in such states as required by law based on principles applicable to traditional businesses 
however  one or more states could seek to impose additional income tax obligations or sales tax collection obligations on out of state companies  such as ours  which engage in or facilitate electronic commerce 
a number of proposals have been made at state and local levels that could impose such taxes on the sale of products and services through the internet or the income derived from such sales 
such proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce and seriously harm our profitability 
legislation limiting the ability of the states to impose taxes on internet based transactions was enacted by the united states congress 
however  this legislation  known as the internet tax freedom act  imposed only a three year moratorium on state and local taxes on electronic commerce  where such taxes are discriminatory  unless such taxes were generally imposed and actually enforced prior to october  the legislation  which commenced october  and was to have expired on october   has since been given a five year extension by the house of representatives 
it is unclear which steps the legislature will take next  and failure to continue to renew this legislation would allow various states to impose taxes on internet based commerce 
the imposition of such taxes could impair the growth of the electronic commerce marketplace and impair our ability to remain profitable 
in addition  we are not certain how our business might be affected by the application to internet commerce of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  encryption and ask jeeves  inc 
table of contents other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  obscenity and export or import matters 
the vast majority of such laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet 
as a result  they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes in laws intended to address such issues could create uncertainty in the internet market 
such uncertainty could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs 
several recent federal laws could have an impact on our business 
the digital millennium copyright act is intended  in part  to limit the liability of eligible online service providers for listing or linking to third party web sites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others 
the children s online protection act and the children s online privacy protection act are intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors 
in addition  the protection of children from sexual predators act of requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances 
such legislation may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities 
due to the nature of the web  it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate web transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws 
we might unintentionally violate such laws  such laws might be modified and new laws might be enacted in the future 
any such developments or developments stemming from enactment or modification of other laws could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us or force us to change our business practices 
third parties may bring intellectual property infringement claims against us that would be expensive to defend and  if successful  could subject us to significant liability and block us from using key technology 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business we have been subject to claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks  patents  and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
any such claims  if made  and any resulting litigation  should it occur  could subject us to significant liability for damages 
in addition  even if we prevail  litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend  and could result in the diversion of our time and attention 
any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims unless we are able to enter into license agreements that might not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
terrorist activities and resulting military and other actions could harm our business 
terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc in september of disrupted commerce throughout the world 
the continued threat of terrorism  recent military action in iraq  and heightened security measures in response to this threat may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world

such a reduction could affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates  and increase the cash compensation we would have to pay to them 
an increase in employee wages and salaries would decrease our cash available for marketing  product development and other uses 
if accounting interpretations relating to revenue recognition change  our reported revenues could decline or we could be forced to make changes in our business practices 
over the last several years  the accounting profession has issued several standards and interpretations relating to revenue recognition 
for example  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab  which explains how the sec staff believes existing revenue recognition rules should be applied 
we believe that our revenue recognition policies are currently in compliance with eitf and sab the accounting profession continues to discuss revenue recognition standards with the objective of providing guidance on potential interpretations 
these discussions and the issuance of interpretations  once finalized  could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices  which could cause us to recognize lower revenues 
these changes may extend sales cycles  increase administrative costs and otherwise harm our business 
risks related to the capital markets we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our future capital needs

see further discussion of this lawsuit and other litigation in item  legal proceedings 
if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly

risks related to our subordinated convertible notes our stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to fluctuate widely regardless of our actual operating performance 
significant volatility in the price of our common stock will likely cause the price of the notes to fluctuate significantly  which may make it difficult for holders to resell the notes or the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes when desired or at attractive prices 
because the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock  volatility or depressed prices for our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of the notes 
holders who receive common stock upon conversion also will be subject to the risk of volatility and depressed prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the notes may encourage short selling in our common stock by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock  and the short selling could also put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock

because the notes are subordinated to our senior debt  in the event of our liquidation or insolvency  a payment default on our designated senior debt  a covenant default on our designated senior debt as defined in description of notes subordination of notes in the resale prospectus  or acceleration of the notes due to an event of default  we will make payments on the notes only after our senior debt has been paid in full 
after paying our senior debt in full  we might not have sufficient assets remaining to pay any or all amounts due on the notes 
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to make any payments on the notes or make any funds available for payment on the notes  whether by dividends  loans or other payments 
the payment of dividends and the making of loans and advances to us by our subsidiaries may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions and are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries have not guaranteed the payment of the notes 
our right to receive assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization  and a noteholder s right to participate in these assets  will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors 
consequently  the notes are effectively subordinated to all liabilities  including trade payables  of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish  except to the extent that we are recognized as a creditor of such subsidiary  in which case our claims would still be ask jeeves  inc 
table of contents subordinate to any security interests in the assets of such subsidiary and any debt of such subsidiary senior to that held by us 
as of december   i we had million of senior debt outstanding consisting primarily of operating leases  and ii our subsidiaries had no outstanding indebtedness and approximately million of other liabilities  including trade payables  but excluding intercompany liabilities  to which the notes are effectively subordinated 
neither we nor our subsidiaries are prohibited or limited from incurring debt or acting as guarantors of debt for others in whom we or our subsidiaries may have an interest under the indenture 
our ability to pay our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected by our or our subsidiaries incurrence of additional indebtedness or other liabilities 
we and our subsidiaries may from time to time incur additional indebtedness and other liabilities  including senior debt 
see description of notes subordination of notes in the resale prospectus 
we significantly increased our leverage as a result of the sale of the notes 
in connection with the sale of the notes  we incurred million of indebtedness  which substantially increased our principal payment obligations 
the degree to which we are leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
we do not expect a public market for the notes to develop 
there currently is no organized trading market for the notes in as much as they are not listed on any exchange and there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any market for the notes that may develop  the ability of the holders to sell their notes  or the prices at which holders of the notes would be able to sell their notes 
if markets were to exist  the notes could trade at prices higher or lower than their initial purchase prices depending on many factors 
if an active market for the notes fails to develop or be sustained  the trading price of the notes could decline significantly 
we do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for quotation on the nasdaq national market 
we might not have the ability to repurchase the notes in cash if a holder exercises its repurchase right upon the occurrence of a change in control 
holders of the notes have the right to require us to redeem the notes upon the occurrence of a change in control prior to maturity as described under the heading description of notes purchase of notes at your option upon a change in control in the resale prospectus 
we might not have sufficient funds to make the required repurchase in cash at such time or the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms 
in addition  our ability to repurchase the notes in cash might be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time 
we have the ability under the terms of the notes to pay the repurchase price in shares of our common stock  regardless of whether we have cash available  but doing so might be highly dilutive

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to interest rate  market and credit risk and related change in the market values of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of high credit quality us  state and municipal government  corporate  asset backed  and agency debt instruments 
investments in both fixed and floating rate securities have some degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted by increases in interest rates 
floating rate securities may produce less income than anticipated if interest rates fall 
as a result  changes in interest rates may cause us to incur losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value or may result in lower than anticipated investment income 
our investment portfolio is categorized as available for sale and accordingly is presented at fair value on the balance sheet 
we manage our exposure to interest rate  market and credit risk in the investment portfolio with investment policies and procedures that limit such variables as term  credit rating and the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
during the year ended december   the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our marketable investment securities and our earnings were not material 
further  we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and our earnings from a hypothetical change in interest rates would not be significant 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  since a significant portion of our operations occurs outside of the us  we enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the british pound 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
however  in order to limit such exposure some contracts of our international operations are denominated in us dollars and certain cash balances are maintained in us dollars 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  transfer pricing risks  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility  particularly the exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar 
changes in these or other factors could harm our business  operating results and financial condition
