executive level overview we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to office based healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets with operations in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  the netherlands  belgium  germany  france  austria  spain  ireland  portugal  australia and new zealand 
our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services to the same customer base 
we conduct our business through two segments healthcare distribution and technology 
our healthcare distribution segment  which is comprised of our dental  medical including veterinary and international business groups  distributes healthcare products primarily consumable and services primarily to office based healthcare practitioners and professionals in the united states  canada and international markets 
products  which are similar for each business group  are maintained and distributed from strategically located distribution centers 
our technology segment consists primarily of our practice management software business and certain other value added products and services that are distributed primarily to healthcare professionals in the united states and canada 
most of the technology business  including members of its management  was acquired as a unit 

table of contents the following table summarizes the significant components of our operating results and cash flows for each of the three years ended december  in thousands years ended december  december  december  operating results net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative merger  integration and restructuring credits operating income other expense  net net income from continuing operations loss on sale of discontined operation  net of tax net income cash flows net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities industry overview in recent years  the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment 
this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices 
this trend has also accelerated the growth of hmos  group practices  other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which  in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at low prices  tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support 
we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably impact demand for practice management systems and software that can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 
our operating results in recent years have been significantly impacted by strategies and transactions we undertook to expand our business  both domestically and internationally  in part  to address significant changes in the healthcare industry  including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies  potential healthcare reform  trends toward managed care  cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 
industry consolidation the office based healthcare practitioner industry  in the geographic markets in which we operate  is highly fragmented and diverse 
encompassing the dental  medical and veterinary markets  this industry accounted for revenues of approximately billion in the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations comprised of between a few and a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 
due in part to the inability of office based healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices  the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to office based healthcare practitioners has traditionally been characterized by frequent  small quantity orders  and a need for rapid  reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment 
the purchasing decision within an office based healthcare practice is typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant  and supplies and small 
table of contents equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier 
we believe that consolidation within the supply industry serving office based healthcare practitioners will continue to result in a number of distributors  particularly companies with limited financial and marketing resources  seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide opportunities for growth 
this consolidation may also continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product offerings and expand the services they can offer or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 
our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products to the healthcare industry 
this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas  which a complement our existing operations  and b provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with  and thus strengthen  the acquired businesses 
as previously discussed  we are currently awaiting regulatory approval for the acquisition of demedis  a leading full service distributor of dental consumables and equipment in germany  austria  and the benelux countries  and edh  which includes krugg spa  italy s leading distributor of dental consumable products and dentalmv gmbh otherwise know as muller weygandt  one of europe s leading direct marketing distributors of dental consumable products 
these acquisitions will approximately double the net sales of our international operations see note to our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we have completed acquisitions in the past five years  including in as industry consolidation continues  we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend  as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure 
in the us dental market  we estimate that there are currently over smaller distributors holding approximately of the market 
in the us medical market  we estimate that over smaller distributors hold approximately of the market  and in the european dental market  we estimate that over competitors hold approximately of the market 
as the healthcare industry continues to change  we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction  if pursued 
if additional transactions are entered into or consummated  we would incur additional merger and acquisition related costs  and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 
aging population and other market influences the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population  increased healthcare awareness  the proliferation of medical technology and testing  new pharmacology treatments and expanded third party insurance coverage 
in addition  the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing in hospitals to the alternate site  particularly physician offices  despite significantly lower pricing of hospital medical products 
as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow  physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices 
the elder care market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly americans 
the january us bureau of the census estimates that the elderly population in america will more than double by the year in  four million americans were age years and older  the segment of the population most in need of long term care and elder care services 
by the year  that number is projected to more than triple to over million 
the population age to years is projected to more than double in the same time period 

table of contents as a result of these market dynamics  the annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the us the centers for medicaid and medicare services cms  office of the actuary published health spending projections through in  indicating that total national healthcare spending reached trillion in  or of the nation s gross domestic product 
healthcare spending is projected to reach trillion in  an estimated of the gross domestic product  the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the us 
governmental influences the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation  licensure  and operating compliance procedures 
national healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by congress 
additionally  government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care 
during  the balanced budget act passed by congress significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers  affecting spending levels and overall financial viability of these institutions 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act the medicare act was passed by congress and enacted by president bush on december  the medicare act is the largest expansion of the medicare program since its inception and provides participants with voluntary prescription drug benefits effective in with an interim drug discount card 
the medicare act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs  generic substitution and provider reimbursement 
based upon current information  we believe the medicare act may create additional volume demand and provide incentives for additional utilization of generic drugs  both of which have potentially positive implications for our pharmaceutical distribution business 
product integrity certain pharmaceutical and medical surgical product manufacturers and legislators are in discussions regarding the risks of counterfeit products in the supply chain and the manufacturers concerns regarding the impact of secondary market distribution on counterfeiting 
as a distributor of such products  we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and with potential litigation

the effect that such transactions had on diluted earnings per share was in liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include the funding of working capital needs  acquisitions  repurchases of common stock and capital expenditures resulting from increased sales and special inventory forward buy in opportunities  pursuing growth opportunities and managing funding needs 
since sales tend to be strong during the fourth quarter and special inventory forward buy in opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year  our working capital requirements have generally been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 
we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations  revolving credit facilities  private placement loans and stock issuances 
our principal source of cash is derived from our operations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services 
given current operating  economic and industry conditions  we believe that demand for our products and services will remain consistent in the foreseeable future 
net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year period 
this decrease was primarily due to increased trade receivable and inventory levels as of december  resulting from increased end of year sales and purchase activity for compared to net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year period 
the decrease was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds received from the sale and maturity of marketable securities and a reduction in capital expenditures  partially offset by an increase in cash used for acquisitions 
we expect to invest approximately between million and million during fiscal year in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities  on computer infrastructure systems and to integrate operations 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million provided by financing activities for the comparable prior year period 
the net change was primarily due to payments made to repurchase our common stock and a reduction in the proceeds received from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options  partially offset by lower principal payments on long term debt 
on march   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of our common stock  which represented approximately of shares outstanding on the announcement date 
during the year ended december   we repurchased and retired  shares at an average price of per share 
the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands december  december  cash and cash equivalents marketable securities  including non current working capital debt  net of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities debt includes bank credit lines and current and non current portions of long term debt  including senior notes  notes and loans payable to banks and capital lease obligations 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds 
these investments have staggered maturity dates  none of which exceed three months  and have a high degree of liquidity since the securities are traded in public markets 
our marketable securities consist of short and long term debt securities classified as available for sale  including corporate bonds rated aaa by moody s or an equivalent rating and commercial paper rated p by moody s or an equivalent rating 
the fair values of our marketable securities are determined by quoted market prices 
our business requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands 
inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity  special inventory forward buy in opportunities  new customer build up requirements and the desired level of investment inventory 
working capital has increased primarily as a result of our higher sales volume 
our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to days for the year ended december  from days for the comparable prior year period primarily due to our continued focus on actively pursuing collection of aged receivables and tightening credit standards 
our inventory turns improved to turns for the year ended december  from turns for the prior year as a result of increased sales of higher turnover products 
we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements as a result of continued sales growth

the million notes come due on june  and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
principal payments totaling million are due annually starting september  on the million notes and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
interest on both notes is payable semi annually 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into agreements relating to the million senior notes to exchange our fixed interest rates for variable interest rates 
the weighted average variable interest rate is 
this weighted average variable interest rate is comprised of libor  plus the spread  and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes 
we have a revolving credit facility of million that is a four year committed line scheduled to terminate in may there were no borrowings under this credit facility as of december  as of december   certain of our subsidiaries had revolving credit facilities  which had outstanding balances of million  against aggregate borrowing limits of million 
in connection with our pending acquisition of demedis and edh for approximately million euros  as previously discussed  after making a deposit on january  of million euros  we will be paying approximately million euros at closing 
the remaining purchase price will be paid from existing cash resources and or the proceeds of i a bridge loan and or ii the issuance or sale in a public or private placement of equity interests or notes  debentures or other debt securities or another debt financing with a maturity in excess of one year in any case  a permanent financing 
we have obtained commitments for a million bridge loan facility scheduled to mature on the six month anniversary of the closing of the acquisition 
the bridge loan will be unsecured  and will bear interest  at our option  at libor plus or the prime rate 
we intend to refinance the bridge loan by means of a permanent financing or  if a permanent financing can be arranged prior to the consummation of the acquisition  we will pay the purchase price with the proceeds of such permanent financing 
the acquisition is subject to standard closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close mid year some holders of minority interests in entities we have acquired have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their interest at a price that approximates fair value pursuant to a formula price based on earnings of the entity 
additionally  some prior owners of acquired businesses are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met 
we have not accrued any liabilities that may arise from these transactions since the outcome of the contingency is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 

table of contents we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least months 
funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs  which  on occasion may change 
consequently  we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  investments in short and long term marketable securities  ability to access public and private debt and equity markets and availability of funds under our existing credit facilities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short term and long term capital needs 
seasonality and other factors affecting our business our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly influences 
net sales and operating profits are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters due to timing of seasonal product sales  software and equipment sales  year end promotions and purchasing patterns of office based healthcare practitioners and are generally lower in the first quarter primarily due to the increased purchases in the prior quarter 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by a variety of other factors  including the timing of acquisitions and related costs  timing of sales  special promotional campaigns  fluctuations in exchange rates and adverse weather conditions 
e commerce traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are impacted by the advancement of electronic on line commerce solutions 
our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and is highly competitive 
the rapid advancement of on line commerce requires us to provide continuous improvement in performance  security  features and reliability of internet content and technology  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
through our proprietary technologically based suite of products  we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives 
we believe that our tradition of reliable service coupled with our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships positions us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business 
we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to sales allowance provisions  as described below  volume purchase rebates  income taxes  inventory and bad debt reserves and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  industry and market trends  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of dental  medical and veterinary consumable products  as well as dental equipment  software products and services and other sources 
provisions for discounts  rebates to 
table of contents customers  customer returns and other adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 
revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers 
such sales typically entail high volume  low dollar orders shipped utilizing third party common carriers 
we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post shipment obligations  the product price is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 
revenue derived from the sale of dental equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers 
such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians 
some equipment sales require minimal installation  which is completed at the time of delivery 
revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers 
such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design 
revenue derived from post contract customer support for software  including annual support and or training  is recognized ratably over the period in which the services are provided 
revenue derived from other sources including freight charges  equipment repairs and financial services  is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 
accounts receivable and reserves the carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable  we consider many factors in estimating our reserve  including historical data  experience  customer types  credit worthiness  and economic trends 
from time to time  we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard fas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
such impairment tests require the comparison of the fair value and carrying value of reporting units 
measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings  unless supportable information is available for using a present value technique  such as estimates of future cash flows 
we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an interim impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income 
based on our impairment review process  we have not recorded any impairments during the year ended december  
table of contents long lived assets long lived assets  other than goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of such assets 
other definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
such definite lived intangible assets primarily consist of non compete agreements and customer relationships 
when an impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
we have not recorded any impairments during the year ended december  stock based compensation we account for stock option awards to employees under the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  no compensation expense is recorded provided the exercise price is equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date 
we make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting the alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation had been applied as required by fas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates  as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
we attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap contracts 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
all interest rate swap and currency contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure  not for speculation 
interest rate swaps we have fixed rate senior notes of million at and million at 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange our fixed interest rates for variable interest rates payable on the million senior notes 
the variable rate is comprised of libor plus the spreads and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes 
as a result of these interest rate swap agreements  as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements  we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
as of december   the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other non current assets was approximately thousand  which represented the amount that would be earned upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time 
changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to the related assets with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the million notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective 
foreign exchange the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results 
fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings  all of which are expressed in us dollars 
where we deem it prudent  we engage in hedging programs  using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts  aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings 
we purchase short term foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with long term intercompany loans  due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign vendors 
we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting not an economic exposure 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts aggregating million  of which million related to intercompany debt and million related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign vendors 
the contracts hedge against currency fluctuations of british pounds million  euros million  australian dollars million  swiss francs million  japanese yen thousand  swedish krona thousand and new zealand dollars thousand 
as of december   the fair value of these contracts  calculated as the gross value of future us dollar payments and receipts determined by quoted market prices was million 
these contracts expire through january for the year ended december   we recognized a loss relating to our foreign currency forward and swap contracts of thousand
