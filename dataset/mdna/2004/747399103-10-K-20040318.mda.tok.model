item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
general overview 
quaker is a leading designer  manufacturer and worldwide marketer of woven upholstery fabrics and one of the largest producers of jacquard upholstery fabrics in the world 
the company also manufactures specialty yarns  most of which are used in the production of the company s fabric products 
the balance is sold to manufacturers of craft yarns  home furnishings and other products 
overall demand levels in the upholstery fabric sector are a function of overall demand for household furniture  which is  in turn  affected by general economic conditions  population demographics  new household formations  consumer confidence and disposable income levels  sales of new and existing homes and interest rates 
competition in the industry is intense  from both domestic fabric mills and fabric mills located outside the us manufacturing products for sale into the us market 
management believes that competition in the us domestic market is likely to further intensify following the january  expiration of the quotas imposed under the uruguay round agreement on textiles and clothing on textile and apparel products coming into the us the company s fabric products compete with other furniture coverings  including leather  suede  prints  tufts  flocks and velvets  for consumer acceptance 
consumer tastes in upholstered furniture coverings are somewhat cyclical and do change over time  with various coverings gaining or losing share depending on changes in home furnishing trends 
for example  leather furniture has enjoyed growing popularity over the past few years  to some extent at the expense of woven fabrics  such as the jacquards and other woven fabrics quaker manufactures 
during  quaker demonstrated outstanding top line results  particularly when compared to the performance of the furniture sector as a whole  achieving record revenues of million for the year  up  with net income of million  new orders up during the fourth quarter versus the comparable period of  and a production backlog at the end of of million 
the company s order rate remained strong going into  and quaker s revenues of million and net income of million both set new company records 
during the first half of  quaker s revenues were running at an annualized rate of approximately million  however  global economic conditions deteriorated as the year progressed  ultimately resulting in a weak fourth quarter  with domestic fabric sales down for the quarter and yarn sales off significantly 
the company s backlog position at year end was also down considerably from million in to million at the end of  due to both significant reductions quaker achieved in its delivery lead times and weakness in the company s fourth quarter order rate 
during  quaker also further strengthened its balance sheet  with the company generating approximately million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter  thereby allowing quaker to reduce funded debt by approximately million during the quarter 
global economic conditions remained relatively weak during  resulting in a challenging business environment for quaker  its suppliers and its customers 
net sales for the week fiscal year ended january  of million were down  with net income of million  down  and diluted earnings per share of 
a refund related to the favorable resolution of a foreign tariff dispute added million of non recurring income to fiscal pre tax income  increasing diluted eps for the year by cents 
uncertainty surrounding the global economic and geopolitical environment continued to put pressure on the company s fabric sales  with domestic fabric sales down and export sales down versus while the company s yarn revenues were also down  yarn sales for the fourth quarter of million were up versus the comparable period of  primarily as a result of the steps taken during the year to strategically reposition that segment of the company s business 
despite a drop of a little over million in quaker s week revenues for the year compared to s week fiscal year  the company s gross margin declined only basis points  showing particular improvement in the fourth quarter 
quaker s operating margin  however  was down basis points for the year  largely because of the ongoing costs associated with the strategic investments the company has made over the past few years to build competitive advantage  particularly in the areas of research and development  product styling and design  and information and supply chain management 
the year over year decrease in the company s revenues caused those investments to push up quaker s sg a as a percentage of revenues results for the year and kept the company from achieving its sg a as a percentage of revenues objectives 
management believes  however  that these investments will fuel quaker s future growth as the economy improves 
in addition  during  quaker reduced inventory  paid dividends for the first time  generated improved cash flows  and paid down debt ending the year with a net debt to total capitalization ratio of  versus at the end of as a result  the company s balance sheet was further strengthened  positioning quaker to continue responding quickly to new challenges and opportunities as they arise 
quaker s success during will  of course  depend  in part  on whether and to what degree macroeconomic conditions improve 
and the company will be continuing to follow trade patterns affecting the industry

by offering a broad assortment of fabrics at each price point and in each styling category  the company has positioned itself as a full service supplier of jacquard and plain woven fabrics to the upholstered furniture segment 
while quaker offers a full range of fabrics to its promotional end customers  the company s primary focus is on the development of products for the middle to upper end of the market  where quaker s design  technology and manufacturing expertise provide the company with the greatest competitive advantage

critical accounting estimates the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting estimates used by the company 
general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to accounts receivable reserves  inventory valuation and inventory reserves  and self insurance reserves 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns and allowances the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by management s review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that credit loss rates in the future will be consistent with those experienced in the past 
the company s accounts receivable are spread among more than  customers and no single customer represents more than and of the accounts receivable balance at january  and january   respectively 
management analyzes historical sales and quality returns  current economic trends  and the company s quality performance when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns and allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the reserve for sales returns and allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of the company s net sales for any period if management makes different judgments or uses different estimates 
inventories inventory is valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
approximately of finished goods are produced upon receipt of a firm order 
management  in partnership with key customers  is utilizing forecasting techniques to significantly reduce delivery lead times 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical information and estimated forecasts of product demand and raw material requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant increase in demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in manufacturing costs  including but not limited to overtime and other costs related to capacity constraints in certain areas of the company 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  assumptions used in determining management s estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of management s forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and the company s reported operating results 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured for workers compensation and medical insurance 
quaker has purchased stop loss coverage for both types of risks in order to minimize the effect of a catastrophic level of claims 
at the end of each accounting period  the reserves for incurred but not reported claims must be evaluated 
management evaluates claims experience on a regular basis in consultation with the company s insurance advisors and makes adjustments to these reserves 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with evaluating the adequacy of self insurance reserves 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of these costs for any period if management makes different judgments or uses different estimates 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
reductions in the useful lives of the company s fixed assets would have an adverse impact on the company s financial results 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that the company recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the company s deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event management were to determine that the company would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should management determine that the company would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company does not provide for united states income taxes on earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states 
the company s intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently 
management believes that united states foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any united states taxes or offset any foreign withholding taxes

foreign sales decreased  to million in from million in this decrease in foreign sales was due primarily to lower sales in mexico  canada and the middle east 
in mexico  where the company competes primarily with mexican fabric mills  weakness in the mexican peso versus the us dollar caused the company to be at a competitive disadvantage vis a vis mexican domestic mills for much of fiscal a significant portion of furniture manufactured in canada is actually sold in the united states 
as a result of a strong canadian dollar during fiscal  canadian furniture sales into the united states declined  reducing demand for the company s upholstery fabric in canada 
the political climate in the middle east during negatively impacted sales into that region 
gross yarn sales decreased  to million in from million in the gross volume of fabric sold decreased  to million yards in from million yards in the weighted average gross sales price per yard increased  to in from in as a result of product mix changes 
the company sold fewer yards of middle to better end fabrics and fewer yards of promotional end fabrics in than in the average gross sales price per yard of middle to better end fabrics increased by  to in from in the average gross sales price per yard of promotional end fabrics increased by  to in from in gross margin 
the gross margin percentage for decreased to as compared to for gross profit declined by million due to lower production volumes resulting in higher fixed costs per unit 
also  total fixed costs increased by approximately million in as compared to primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense

the company s estimated tax rate was for and the first quarter of in the second quarter of  the company adjusted the estimated annual effective tax rate for downward to 
this reduction in the tax rate is due to lower levels of projected income for reducing the effective statutory federal tax rate from to approximately and an increased estimated benefit to the tax rate from the extraterritorial income exclusion 
in the fourth quarter of  the company adjusted the annual effective tax rate to 
this increase was due to the tariff refund received from the mexican tax authorities during the fourth quarter which was taxed at a higher rate 
the effective income tax rate is lower than the combined federal and state statutory rates  due primarily to certain tax benefits related to extraterritorial income at the federal level and investment tax credits at the state level 
the company is currently challenging tax assessments from the internal revenue service for the years and from the massachusetts department of revenue for the years the ultimate resolution of these actions is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
in addition  during the third quarter  the company filed amended tax returns for these and subsequent years to claim approximately million of federal and state research and development credits 
audits of these amended returns commenced during october there is significant uncertainty surrounding the amount and timing of the benefit that will be ultimately realized  if any 
the company believes that it has a supportable basis for claiming these credits  but the amounts are subject to ongoing audits by federal and state authorities 
accordingly  the company has not reflected the potential benefits of these credits in its financial statements for these or subsequent years 
no benefit will be recognized in the financial statements until these gain contingencies are resolved through the eventual disposition with the respective tax authorities

distribution of revenues among the fiscal quarters also affects the incurrence of overtime 
in record sales during the first half of the year resulted in significant overtime costs  while less overtime was incurred during the second half of the year because of lower demand for the company s products

as it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of the company s actual future financial condition or results 
these forward looking statements like any forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated 
such risks and uncertainties include product demand and market acceptance of the company s products  regulatory uncertainties  the effect of economic conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in customers ordering patterns  and the effect of uncertainties in markets outside the us including mexico and south america in which the company operates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposures relative to market risk are due to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk approximately of the company s revenues are generated outside the us from sales which are not denominated in us dollars 
foreign currency risk arises because the company engages in business in mexico and brazil in local currency 
accordingly  in the absence of hedging activities  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the other major currencies  there is an adverse affect on the company s results of operations  and alternatively  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the other major currencies  there is a positive affect on the company s results of operations 
it is the company s policy to minimize  for a period of time  the unforeseen impact on its results of operations of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the fair value of foreign currency denominated intercompany payables 
the company s primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the us dollar are the mexican peso and the brazilian real 
at january   the company had the following significant derivative financial instruments to hedge the anticipated cash flows from the repayment of foreign currency denominated intercompany payables outstanding notional weighted amount in average notional local contract amount in fair type of instrument currency currency rate us dollars value maturity forward contract mexican peso million million  january forward contract brazilian real million million  may the company estimated the change in the fair value of all derivative financial instruments assuming both a strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to all other major currencies 
in the event of a strengthening of the us dollar  the change in fair value of all derivative financial instruments would result in approximately a million unrealized gain  whereas a weakening of the us dollar would result in approximately a million unrealized loss 
interest rate risk all of the company s long term debt is at fixed rates 
accordingly  a change in interest rates has an insignificant effect on the company s interest expense 
the fair value of the company s long term debt  however  would change in response to interest rate movements due to its fixed rate nature 
using a scenario analysis  the company has evaluated the impact on all long term maturities of changing the interest rate from the rate levels that existed at january  and has determined that such a rate change would not have a material impact on the company
