table of contents critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes and valuing goodwill have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on the critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues primarily from professional fees earned on consulting engagements and fees earned for the use of our equipment and facilities  as well as reimbursements for outside direct expenses associated with the services that are billed to our clients 
substantially all of our engagements are performed under time and material or fixed price billing arrangements 
on time and material and fixed price projects  revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed 
for our fixed price engagements we recognize revenue based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to our estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates we expect to incur over the term of the contract 
we believe this methodology achieves a reliable measure of the revenue from the consulting services we provide to our customers under fixed price contracts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
these judgments and estimates include an assessment of collectibility and  for fixed price engagements  an estimate as to the total effort required to complete the project 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different 
all consulting contracts are subject to review by management  which requires a positive assessment of the collectibility of contract amounts 
if  during the course of the contract  we determine that collection of revenue is not reasonably assured  we do not recognize the revenue until its collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client and project manager  as well as the credit worthiness of the client 
losses on fixed price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes evident 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total costs of the contract exceeds the total fixed price of the contract 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of our ability to collect accounts receivable and our unbilled work in process 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debts  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic conditions and changes in customer payment terms 
as of january   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  such as current tax laws  our 
table of contents interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods  then we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
based on our current financial projections and operating plan for fiscal  we currently believe that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets 
valuing goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
factors that we consider when evaluating for possible impairment include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative economic trends 
when evaluating our goodwill for impairment  based upon the existence of one or more of the above factors  we determine the existence of an impairment by assessing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit  including goodwill  using expected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss is recognized 
we completed our annual impairment review during and determined that we had no impairment of our goodwill and therefore did not record an impairment charge 
as of january   goodwill totaled million

during fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to net cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from issuance of common stock 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock are primarily related to the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs  strategically acquire professional services firms that are complementary to our business and pay dividends

we have a revolving reducing mortgage note with a total available borrowing amount of million and an outstanding balance of as of march  we believe that our existing revolving note  together with funds generated from operations  will provide adequate cash to fund our anticipated cash needs through at least the next twelve month period 
in addition  we believe that the funds available under the revolving reducing mortgage note  together with funds generated from operations  will provide adequate cash to fund our anticipated long term cash needs beyond the next twelve month period  however  we intend to grow our business by pursuing potential acquisitions  which could increase the need for additional sources of funds over the long term 
as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
factors that may affect future operating results and market price of stock exponent operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
these uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those mentioned elsewhere in this report and the following absence of backlog revenues are primarily derived from services provided in response to client requests or events that occur without notice  and engagements  generally billed as services are performed  are terminable or subject to postponement or delay at any time by clients 
as a result  backlog at any particular time is small in relation to our quarterly or annual revenues and is not a reliable indicator of revenues for any future periods 
revenues and operating margins for any particular quarter are generally affected by staffing mix  resource requirements and timing and size of engagements 
attraction and retention of key employees exponent s business involves the delivery of professional services and is labor intensive 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
qualified personnel are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
we cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to attract sufficient numbers of highly qualified technical and managerial personnel and to retain existing employees 
the loss of a significant number of our employees could have a material adverse impact on our business  including our ability to secure and complete engagements 
competition the markets for our services are highly competitive 
in addition  there are relatively low barriers to entry into our markets and we have faced  and expect to continue to face  additional competition from new entrants into our markets 
competitive pressure could reduce the market acceptance of our services and result in price reductions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
customer concentration we currently derive and believe that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients  organizations and insurers related to the transportation industry 
transportation industry 
table of contents related engagements accounted for approximately of our gross revenues for the fiscal year ended january  in addition  we performed engagements for the government sector  which accounted for approximately of our gross revenues for the fiscal year ended january  the loss of any large client  organization or insurer related to either the transportation industry or government sector could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
economic uncertainty the markets that we serve are cyclical and subject to general economic conditions  particularly in light of the labor intensive nature of our business and our relatively high compensation expenses 
if the economy in which we operate  which is predominately in the us  were to experience a prolonged slowdown  demand for our services could be reduced considerably 
regulation public concern over health  safety and preservation of the environment has resulted in the enactment of a broad range of environmental and or other laws and regulations by local  state and federal lawmakers and agencies 
these laws and the implementing regulations affect nearly every industry  as well as the agencies of federal  state and local governments charged with their enforcement 
to the extent changes in such laws  regulations and enforcement or other factors significantly reduce the exposures of manufacturers  owners  service providers and others to liability  the demand for our services may be significantly reduced 
tort reform several of our practices have a significant concentration in litigation support consulting services 
to the extent tort reform reduces the exposure of manufacturers  owners  service providers and others to liability  the demand for our litigation support consulting services may be significantly reduced 
variability of quarterly financial results variations in our revenues and operating results occur from time to time  as a result of a number of factors  such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter  the number of working days in a quarter  employee hiring and utilization rates  and integration of companies acquired 
because a high percentage of our expenses  particularly personnel and facilities related  are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of our client assignments  at or near the end of any quarter  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk exponent is exposed to interest rate risk associated with our balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities in accordance with the company s investment policy 
the maximum maturity of any issue in our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments is years and the maximum average maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed months 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
the average maturity of our short term investments at january  was years 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risk  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
we are exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
given the limited nature of these operations  we believe that any exposure would be minimal 
exponent has a revolving reducing mortgage note the mortgage note secured by our silicon valley headquarters building 
the mortgage note had an initial borrowing amount up to million and is subject to automatic annual reductions in the amount available to be borrowed of between million to million approximately per year until january  as of january  we had outstanding and available borrowings of million 
as of march  our available borrowings under this note decreased to million due to the annual reductions in the amount available to be borrowed 
the mortgage note is subject to two interest rate options of either prime less or the fixed libor plus with a term of one month  two months  three months  six months  nine months  or twelve months 
any borrowings under the mortgage note would expose us to some interest rate risk 
our general policy for selecting among interest rate options and related terms will be to minimize interest expense 
however  given the risk of interest rate fluctuations  we cannot be certain that the lowest rate option will always be obtained  thereby consistently minimizing our interest expense 
no sensitivity analysis was performed on our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  however  given the historical low volatility of both the prime and libor interest rates  we believe that any exposure would be minimal
