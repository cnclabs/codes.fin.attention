item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and other information included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration  production and acquisition of natural gas and oil in the united states  both onshore gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico 
our primary source of natural gas and oil production currently is in south texas 
we also own a partnership interest in freeport lng development  lp  which is developing a bcf per day lng receiving terminal in freeport  texas and have a interest in contango capital partnership management  llc  which was formed to invest in the alternative energy venture capital market 
revenues and profitability 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil and on our ability to find  develop and acquire natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable and the completion and successful operation of our freeport lng project 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved natural gas and oil reserves 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas and oil activities 
reserve replacement 
generally  our producing properties onshore gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico have high initial production rates  followed by steep declines 
as a result  we must locate and develop or acquire new natural gas and oil reserves to replace those being depleted by production 
substantial capital expenditures are required to find  develop and acquire natural gas and oil reserves 

table of contents use of estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include estimates of remaining proved natural gas and oil reserves and the timing and costs of our future drilling  development and abandonment activities 
please see risk factors on page for a more detailed discussion of a number of other factors that affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following is a discussion of the results of our operations for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  and for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  revenues 
all of our revenues are from the sale of our natural gas and oil production and the settlement of hedging contracts associated with our natural gas and oil production 
our revenues may vary significantly from year to year depending on changes in commodity prices and production volumes 
the table below sets forth revenue and production data for the fiscal years ended june   and year ended june  year ended june  revenues natural gas and oil sales gain loss from hedging activities total revenues production natural gas million cubic feet oil and condensate thousand barrels total million cubic feet equivalent natural gas million cubic feet per day oil and condensate barrels per day total million cubic feet per day equivalent average sales price natural gas per thousand cubic feet oil and condensate per barrel not meaningful natural gas and oil sales 
substantially all of our natural gas and oil sales are from our production in south texas 
we reported natural gas and oil sales of approximately million for the year ended june   down from approximately million reported for the year ended june  this decrease was principally attributable to normal production declines in our existing south texas properties and the sale of non core producing properties in brooks county  texas 
these declines were partially offset by increases in average prices received for our natural gas and oil production 
we reported natural gas and oil sales of approximately million for the year ended june   up from approximately million reported for the year ended june  this increase was attributable to substantial increases in the prices received for natural gas and oil production that were partially offset by a decrease in natural gas and oil production 

table of contents natural gas and oil production and average sales prices 
for the year ended june   our net natural gas production was approximately million cubic feet of natural gas per day  down from approximately million cubic feet of natural gas per day for the year ended june  net oil production for the period was down from barrels of oil per day to barrels of oil per day 
these decreases primarily were due to normal production declines in our existing south texas properties and the sale of non core producing properties in brooks county  texas 
for the year ended june   prices for natural gas and oil were per mcf and per barrel  up from per mcf and per barrel for the year ended june  for the year ended june   our net natural gas production decreased from approximately million cubic feet of natural gas per day to approximately million cubic feet of natural gas per day 
net oil production for the period was down from barrels of oil per day to barrels of oil per day 
these decreases primarily were due to the natural decline in production from our original south texas properties  which was partially offset by new production from south texas discoveries made during year ended june  for the year ended june   prices for natural gas and oil were per mcf and per barrel  up substantially from per mcf and per barrel for the year ended june  gain loss from hedging activities 
we reported a gain from hedging activities for the year ended june  of approximately  for the year ended june   we reported a loss from hedging activities of approximately million 
this loss included an approximate million realized loss on various swap  put and call agreements that was offset by an unrealized gain of about  for the year ended june   we recognized a gain from hedging activities of approximately million 
this gain consisted primarily of gains on settlements of swap derivative agreements 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  including severance taxes  for the year ended june  were approximately million  down from the million reported for the year ended june  of the million reported for the year ended june   approximately million was attributable to lease operating expense and approximately million was attributable to production and severance taxes 
the decrease in operating expenses for the year ended june  was attributable to lower production and the extension of a natural gas incentive by the railroad commission of texas to allow for severance tax reduction on tight sand gas wells 
as a result  some of our south texas queen city formation properties are eligible for severance tax reduction 
operating expenses  including severance taxes  for the year ended june  were approximately million  up from the million reported for the year ended june  of the million reported for the year ended june   approximately million was attributable to production and severance taxes and approximately million was attributable to lease operating expense 
the increase in operating expenses for the year ended june  was attributable to increases in severance taxes as a result of higher revenues  greater ad valorem taxes and lease operating expenses as a result of increased working interests in our south texas properties and to higher overall costs of operations 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower production 
operating expenses for the year ended june  totaled approximately million and included approximately million of lease operating expenses and million of production and severance taxes 
exploration expense 
we reported approximately million of exploration expenses for the year ended june  of this amount  approximately million was attributable to dry holes drilled in south texas million and to our unsuccessful well drilled in france million  approximately million was attributable to seismic costs and delay rentals associated with activities onshore in south texas and approximately million was attributable to seismic costs and delay rentals associated with activities offshore in the gulf of mexico 
we reported approximately million of exploration expenses for the year ended june  of this amount  approximately million was attributable to the cost to acquire and reprocess d seismic data offshore in the gulf of mexico  approximately million was the cost to shoot and to acquire d seismic in south texas and approximately million was related to dry hole costs in south texas 

table of contents for the year ended june   we reported approximately million of exploration expenses 
this amount primarily was attributable to the expensing of million in dry holes drilled on our south texas properties and million of seismic costs and delay rentals attributable to activities offshore in the gulf of mexico 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for the fiscal years ended june   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for these periods was attributable primarily to depletion and amortization related to production onshore in south texas 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower levels of production and a lower unit dd a rate 
the increase in was due to the cost of new wells drilled 
impairment of natural gas and oil properties 
impairment expense for the year ended june  and was approximately  and  respectively 
these related to impairment of properties held by republic exploration and magnolia offshore exploration 
impairment expense for the year ended june  was approximately  and related to impairment of a lease prospect in south texas and to an impairment of one of our offshore wells 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  major components of general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  included approximately  in salaries and benefits   in legal  accounting  engineering and other professional fees   of office administration and  of insurance costs 
also included in total general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  was approximately  related to the cost of expensing stock options   related to our gulf of mexico exploration activities   for board compensation expense and  in other expenses

general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were approximately million 
major components of general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  included approximately  in salaries and benefits   in legal  accounting  engineering and other professional fees including  of one time costs associated with the proposed public offering of our series c preferred stock   of office administration and  of insurance costs 
also included in total general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  was approximately  related to the cost of expensing stock options   related to our gulf of mexico exploration activities and  in other expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses between the fiscal years and was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits resulting primarily from employee bonus payments made during fiscal year  higher insurance cost  principally directors and officers insurance  and higher stock option expenses 
these increases were offset by lower legal and other professional fees 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses between the fiscal years and was primarily due to decreases in salaries and benefits resulting primarily from a lower level of employee bonus payments and decreases in legal expenses 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal years ended june   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the higher level of interest for the fiscal year was attributable to higher level of bank debt during the period primarily to fund seismic and other geological and geophysical costs and to acquire properties in south texas 
the lower level of interest in fiscal year was attributable to lower levels of bank debt during the period 
interest rates were relatively constant during the three year period 
gain on sale of marketable equity securities 
as part of the formation of freeport lng development  lp  cheniere granted contango warrants to purchase  shares of cheniere common stock 
in june and september  contango exercised the warrants  purchasing  shares of cheniere common stock 
as of june   the company had sold  shares of cheniere common stock and reported a gain on the sale of marketable securities for the year ended june  of  gain on sale of assets and other 
for the year ended june   we reported an approximate million gain on the sale of assets 
in september  we sold properties within our south texas exploration program consisting of wells in brooks county  texas for million  reporting a gain of approximately million attributable to this producing property sale 
in december  contango and its owned subsidiary  republic exploration  sold their producing gulf of mexico leases for approximately million 
as a result of this sale  contango recorded a gain of approximately million as of june  properties included in the sale were eugene island  grand isle and high island l 
because the interests sold were unearned back in working interests  contango had no proved reserves attributable to the properties sold see footnote to notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended june   we reported a gain of approximately million 
this was attributable to gains on leases sold by republic exploration and gains realized on the sale of certain partnership interests and properties located in colorado and ft 
bend counties  texas 
capital resources and liquidity during the year ended june   we funded our activities with internally generated cash flow  bank borrowings  sales of assets and the sale of our series c preferred stock 
we currently expect to spend to million on natural gas and oil exploration activities during fiscal year the majority of our spending will be for exploration activities 
we reported total revenues and ebitdax for the year ended june  of approximately million and million  respectively 
our current production rate is approximately mmbtue per day 
at anticipated production levels and current commodity price levels  we expect to have ebitdax of to million per month through december we believe that our cash on hand  our anticipated cash flow from operations and funds available under our credit facility will be adequate over the next twelve months to satisfy planned capital expenditures to fund drilling activities  our share of construction costs related to the freeport lng receiving terminal and incremental investments in contango venture capital corporation and to satisfy general corporate needs 
we may seek additional equity  sell assets or seek other financing to fund our exploration program and to take advantage of other opportunities that may become available 
the availability of such funds will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors over which we have no control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents contractual obligations presented below are our contractual commitments for the periods indicated 
see credit facility below for a description of our secured  reducing revolving bank line of credit 
fiscal year ending june  total thereafter office lease office equipment total credit facility our credit facility is a secured  reducing revolving line of credit with guaranty bank  fsb  secured by our natural gas and oil reserves 
in september  the borrowing base was redetermined to million in two tranches 
tranche a provides for a borrowing base of million and matures on june  this amount reduces by  per month the first day of each month beginning november  borrowings under tranche a bear interest  at our option  at either i libor plus two percent or ii the bank s base rate plus one fourth percent per annum 
additionally  we pay a quarterly commitment fee of three eighths percent per annum on the average availability of tranche a 
tranche b provides for a borrowing base of million and matures on april  borrowings under tranche b will reduce by  per month the first day of each month following the month in which tranche b is funded  with the final reduction on april  further  any amounts borrowed and repaid under tranche b cannot be reborrowed 
borrowings under tranche b bear interest  at the company s option  at either i libor plus three percent or ii the bank s base rate plus three quarters percent per annum 
additionally  we pay a quarterly commitment fee of one half percent per annum on the average availability under tranche b 
the hydrocarbon borrowing base is subject to semi annual redetermination based primarily on the value of our proved reserves 
the credit facility requires the maintenance of certain ratios  including those related to working capital  funded debt to ebitdax  and debt service coverage  as defined in the credit facility 
additionally  the credit facility contains certain negative covenants that  among other things  restrict or limit our ability to incur indebtedness  sell assets  pay dividends and reacquire or otherwise acquire or redeem capital stock 
failure to maintain required financial ratios or comply with the credit facility s covenants can result in a default and acceleration of all indebtedness under the credit facility 
as of june   the company s long term debt totaled million  all of which was outstanding under tranche a of the line of credit 
the average interest rate on the company s long term debt at june  was 
as of june   the company was in compliance with its financial covenants  ratios and other provisions of the credit facility 
on september   we had approximately million in cash on hand  million borrowed under our credit facility and approximately million of unused bank borrowing capacity 
critical accounting policies the application of generally accepted accounting principles involves certain assumptions  judgments  choices and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
thus  the application of these principles can result in varying results from company to company 
contango s critical accounting principles  which are described below  relate to the successful efforts method for costs related to natural gas and oil activities  consolidation principles  accounting for financial instruments and stock options 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
table of contents reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserve quantities and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom see supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of natural gas and oil produced are recognized upon the passage of title  net of royalties 
revenues from natural gas production are recorded using the sales method 
when sales volumes exceed the company s entitled share  an overproduced imbalance occurs 
to the extent the overproduced imbalance exceeds the company s share of the remaining estimated proved natural gas reserves for a given property  the company records a liability 
at june  and  the company had no overproduced imbalances 
cash equivalents 
cash equivalents are considered to be all highly liquid debt investments having an original maturity of three months or less 
as of june  and  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
the carrying amounts approximated fair market value due to the short maturity of these instruments 
marketable equity securities 
all of the company s marketable securities related to an investment in cheniere energy common stock 
the company has classified these securities as trading assets 
trading assets are stated at fair value  with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings under gain on sale of assets and other 
net income loss per common share 
basic and diluted net income loss per common share have been computed in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share 
basic net income loss per common share is computed by dividing income loss attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock 
see footnote for the calculations of basic and diluted net income per common share 
income taxes 
the company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of i temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and ii operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  based upon management s estimates  it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period 
concentration of credit risk 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable result from natural gas and oil sales or joint interest billings to a limited number of third parties in the natural gas and oil industry 
this concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact the company s overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions 
consolidated statements of cash flows 
for the purpose of cash flows  the company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents 
significant transactions may occur which do not directly affect cash balances and  as such  are not disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
certain such non cash transactions are disclosed in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity  including shares issued as compensation and issuance of stock options 
fair value of financial instruments 
the carrying amounts of the company s short term financial instruments  including cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable  approximate their fair values based on the short maturities of those instruments 
the company s long term debt is variable rate debt and  as such  approximates fair value  as interest rates are variable based on prevailing market rates 
successful efforts method of accounting 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its natural gas and oil activities 
under the successful efforts method  lease acquisition costs and 
table of contents all development costs are capitalized 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  and any such impairment is charged to expense in the period 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized until the results are determined 
if proved reserves are not discovered  the exploratory drilling costs are expensed 
other exploratory costs  such as seismic costs and other geological and geophysical expenses  are expensed as incurred 
the provision for depreciation  depletion and amortization is based on the capitalized costs as determined above 
depreciation  depletion and amortization is on a cost center basis using the unit of production method  with lease acquisition costs amortized over total proved reserves and other costs amortized over proved developed reserves 
when circumstances indicate that proved properties may be impaired  the company compares expected undiscounted future cash flows on a cost center basis to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on the company s estimate of future natural gas and oil prices and operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  then the capitalized cost is reduced to fair market value 
on july   the company changed its accounting policy for amortizing and impairing the company s natural gas and oil properties from a well by well cost center basis to a field by field cost center basis 
management believes the newly adopted policy is preferable in the circumstances to have greater comparability with other successful efforts natural gas and oil companies by conforming to predominant industry practice 
in addition  the field level is consistent with the company s operational and strategic assessment of its natural gas and oil investments 
the company determined that the cumulative effect of the change in accordance with apb opinion no 
was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of contango oil gas company and its subsidiaries and affiliates  after elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions 
wholly owned subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
subsidiaries not wholly owned  such as owned republic exploration llc republic exploration  owned magnolia offshore exploration llc magnolia offshore exploration and owned contango offshore exploration llc contango offshore exploration are not controlled by the company and are proportionately consolidated 
by agreement  republic exploration  magnolia offshore exploration and contango offshore exploration have disproportionate allocations of their profits and losses among the owners 
accordingly  the company determines its income or losses from the ventures based on a hypothetical liquidation determination of how increases or decreases in the book value of the ventures net assets will ultimately affect the cash payments to the company in the event of dissolution 
during the quarter ended december   both republic exploration and magnolia offshore exploration completed exploration activities to fully expend the company s initial cash contributions to the ventures thereby triggering a change in profit and loss allocations 
this triggering event earned the other partners in republic exploration and magnolia offshore exploration the right to receive their proportionate share of the company s initial investment in republic exploration and magnolia offshore exploration 
as such  the company proportionately consolidated of republic exploration s and of magnolia offshore exploration s net assets as of december   as opposed to of each ventures net assets as of september  the reduction of the company s ownership in the net assets of republic exploration and magnolia offshore exploration resulted in a non cash exploration expense of approximately million and approximately  respectively 
the company s cash contributions to contango offshore exploration during the year ended june  that were expended for geological and geophysical data resulted in an approximate million exploration expense 
the company s proportionate share of the ventures cash balances is classified as other long term assets since it is expected those funds will be expended for their intended purposes 
by agreement  since the company was the only owner that contributed cash to republic exploration and magnolia offshore exploration  the company consolidated of the ventures net assets and results of operations until the ventures expended all of the company s initial cash contributions 
subsequent to that event  the owners share in the net assets of the ventures is based on their stated ownership percentages 
by agreement  the owners in contango offshore exploration immediately share in the net assets of contango 
table of contents offshore exploration  including the initial company cash contribution  based on their stated ownership percentages 
the other owners of republic exploration  magnolia offshore exploration and contango offshore exploration contributed seismic data and related geological and geophysical services to the ventures 
contango s limited partnership interest in freeport lng is accounted for at cost 
as a limited partner  the company has no ability to direct or control the operations or management of the general partner 
investment in contango capital in which contango has ownership is accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method  only contango s investment in and amounts due to and from the equity investee are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
recent accounting pronouncements 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued several new pronouncements  including interpretation no 
revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the primary objectives of fin r are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights these entities are referred to as variable interest entities or vies and how to determine if a business enterprise should consolidate the vies 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity for which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties in addition  fin r requires that all enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures regarding their relationship with the vie 
the interpretation requires public entities to apply fin r to all entities that are considered special purpose entities in practice and under the fasb literature that was applied before the issuance of fin r by the end of the first reporting period that ended after december  application of the accounting requirements of the interpretation to all other entities is required by the end of the first reporting period that ended after march  the adoption of fin r had no effect on the company s financial statements 
sfas amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities under sfas the amendments set forth in sfas require that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly 
sfas is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  with limited exceptions and for hedging relationships designated after june  the guidance is to be applied prospectively only 
the adoption of sfas had no effect on the company s financial statements 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  it was to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of sfas and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
restatement is not permitted 
the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents stock based compensation 
prior to the fiscal year ended june   the company accounted for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the intrinsic method  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of the company s common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the common stock 
effective july   the company prospectively changed its method of accounting for employee stock based compensation to the fair value based method prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the award vesting period 
the fair value of each award is estimated as of the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
the company has determined that the fair value method is preferable to the intrinsic value method previously applied 
during the years ended june   and  the company recorded a charge of   and  to general and administrative expense  respectively 
because compensation expense is recognized over a vesting period  the effect of applying the fair value method in the initial years of implementation may not be representative of the effects on net income loss that will be reported in future years 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
contango previously has entered into commodity derivatives contracts and fixed price physical contracts to manage its exposure to natural gas and oil price volatility 
commodity derivatives contracts  which are usually placed with investment grade companies that the company believes are minimal credit risk  may take the form of futures contracts  swaps or options 
the natural gas and oil reference prices upon which these commodity derivatives contracts are based reflect various market indices that have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received by the company 
the table below sets forth the company s hedging activities for the periods indicated year ended june  mark to market reversal of prior period unrealized recognized loss gain net cash received paid from swap settlements options purchased mark to market loss unrealized gain loss from hedging activities although the company s hedging transactions generally have been designed as economic hedges for a portion of future natural gas and oil production  the company elected not to designate the derivative instruments as hedges under sfas as a result  gains and losses  representing changes in these derivative instruments mark to market fair values  were recognized in the company s earnings 
the company had no open commodity derivative contracts at june  and has a policy to hedge only through the purchase of puts 

table of contents asset retirement obligation 
the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas  as of july  sfas requires the company to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  a company increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
activities related to the company s aro during the year ended june  and are as follows year ended june  initial aro as of july liabilities incurred during period liabilities settled during period accretion expense balance of aro as of june item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity risk 
our major commodity price risk exposure is to the prices received for our natural gas and oil production 
realized commodity prices received for our production are the spot prices applicable to natural gas and crude oil 
prices received for natural gas and oil are volatile and unpredictable and are beyond our control 
for the year ended june   a fluctuation in the prices received for natural gas and oil production would have had an approximate million impact on our revenues 
hedging activities 
due to the significant volatility in natural gas prices and the potential risk of significant hedging losses if nymex natural gas prices spike on the date options settle  our policy is to hedge only through the purchase of puts 
interest rate risk 
the carrying value of our debt approximates fair value 
at june   we had approximately million of long term debt 
this debt matures in june and bears interest  at our option  at either i libor plus two percent or ii the bank s base rate plus one fourth percent per annum 
the average interest rate on long term debt at june  was 
the results of a fluctuation in short term rates would have had an approximate  impact on interest expense for the year ended june
