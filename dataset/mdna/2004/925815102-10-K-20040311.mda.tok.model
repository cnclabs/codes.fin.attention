significant attention across many functional areas of the company has been focused on the design  development  introduction and production of the new fpa products see part i  item i the products factorized power architecture

this table and the subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements of the company contained elsewhere in this report 
year ended december  net revenues gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses loss before income taxes critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following accounting policies involve its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts vicor maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  based on assessments of customers credit risk profiles and payment histories 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories the company estimates allowances for its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon its known backlog and historical usage  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
while we have used our best efforts and believe we have used the best available information to estimate future demand  due to uncertainty in the economy and our business and the inherent difficulty in predicting future demand  it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
long lived assets management evaluates the recoverability of the company s identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which generally requires that the recoverability of these assets be assessed when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the company periodically assesses the remaining use of fixed assets based upon operating results and cash flows from operations 
equipment has been written down as a result of these assessments as necessary 
a further decline in the company s business could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods 
warranty the company generally warrants its products for a period of two years 
vicor maintains allowances for estimated product returns under warranty based upon a review of known or potential product failures in the field and upon historical patterns of product returns 
if unforeseen product issues arise or product returns increase above expected rates  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company has assessed the need for a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance for a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is warranted at december  in reaching this conclusion  the company evaluated all relevant criteria including the existence of significant temporary differences reversing in the carryforward period  primarily depreciation 
the valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets may require adjustment in the future based on changes in the mix of temporary differences  changes in tax laws  and operating performance 
in addition  the assessment of the valuation allowance requires the company to make estimates of future taxable income and to estimate reversals of temporary differences 
changes in the assumptions or other circumstances may require additional valuation allowances if actual reversals of temporary differences differ from those estimates 
the company operates in numerous taxing jurisdictions and is  therefore  subject to a variety of income and related taxes 
the company has provided for potential tax liabilities due in various jurisdictions which it judges to be probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
judgment is required in determining the income tax expense and related tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the company believes it has reasonably estimated its accrued taxes for all jurisdictions for all open tax periods 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of its tax and related accruals on a quarterly basis and adjusts appropriately as events warrant and open tax periods close 
it is possible that the final tax outcome of these matters will be different from management s estimate reflected in the income tax provisions and accrued taxes 
such differences could have a material impact on the company s income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made
