item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following accounting policies that are critical to the presentation of our financial statements and that require critical accounting estimates by management 
mortgage backed securities we record our mortgage backed securities at fair value 
the fair values of our mortgage backed securities are generally based on market prices provided by certain dealers who make markets on these financial instruments or third party pricing services 
if the fair value of a mortgage backed security is not reasonably available  management estimates the fair value  which requires management s judgment and may not be indicative of the amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
mortgage loans held for sale mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or aggregate market value 
the cost basis includes the capitalized value of the irlcs related to the mortgage loans and any net deferred origination costs 
for mortgage loans held for sale that are hedged with forward sale commitments  the carrying value is adjusted for the change in market during the time the hedge was deemed to be highly effective 
the market value is determined by outstanding commitments from investors or current yield requirements calculated on an aggregate basis 
mortgage servicing rights when we acquire servicing assets through either purchase or origination of loans and sell or securitize those loans with servicing assets retained  the total cost of the loans is allocated to the servicing assets and the loans without the servicing assets based on their relative fair values 
the amount attributable to the servicing assets is capitalized as mortgage servicing rights msrs on the consolidated balance sheets 
the msrs are amortized to expense in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income 
the msrs are assessed for impairment based on the fair value of those assets 
we estimate the fair value of the servicing assets by obtaining market information from a primary mortgage servicing rights broker 
when the book value of capitalized servicing assets exceeds their fair value  impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance 
in determining impairment  the mortgage servicing portfolio is stratified by the predominant risk characteristic of the underlying mortgage loans 
we have determined that the predominant risk characteristic is the interest rate on the underlying loan 
we measure impairment for each stratum by comparing the estimated fair value to the recorded book value 
temporary impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance and amortization expense in the period of occurrence 
in addition  we periodically evaluate our msrs for other than temporary impairment to determine if the carrying value before the application of the valuation allowance is recoverable 
we receive a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of our msrs assuming a basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates from an independent mortgage servicing rights broker 
the fair value estimate includes changes in market assumptions that would be expected given the increase in mortgage rates eg  prepayment speeds would be lower 
we believe this basis point increase in mortgage rates to be an appropriate threshold for determining the recoverability of the temporary impairment because that size rate increase is foreseeable and consistent with historical mortgage rate fluctuations 
when using this instantaneous change in rates  if the fair value of the strata of msrs is estimated to increase to a point where all of the impairment would be recovered  the impairment is considered to be temporary 
when we determine that a portion of the msrs is not recoverable  the related msrs and the previously established valuation allowance are correspondingly reduced to reflect other than temporary impairment 
derivative assets and derivative liabilities our mortgage committed pipeline includes interest rate lock commitments irlcs that have been extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
irlcs are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded to current earnings 
the fair value of the irlcs is determined by an estimate of the ultimate gain on sale of the loans  including the value of msrs  net of estimated net costs remaining to originate the loan 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 which provides industry guidance that will change the timing of recognition of msrs for irlcs initiated after march  see recently issued accounting standards in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we use other derivative instruments  including mortgage forward delivery contracts and treasury futures options  to economically hedge the irlcs  which are also classified and accounted for as free standing derivatives and thus are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded to current earnings 
we use mortgage forward delivery contracts designated as fair value hedging instruments to hedge of our agency eligible conforming loans and most of our non conforming loans held for sale 
at the inception of the hedge  we formally document the relationship between the forward delivery contracts and the mortgage inventory  as well as our objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions 
in the case of our conventional conforming fixed rate loan products  the notional amount of the forward delivery contracts  along with the underlying rate and terms of the contracts  are equivalent to the unpaid principal amount of the mortgage inventory being hedged  hence  the forward delivery contracts effectively fix the forward sales price and thereby substantially eliminate interest rate and price risk to us 
we classify and account for these forward delivery contracts as fair value hedges 
the derivatives are carried at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded to current earnings 
when the hedges are deemed to be highly effective  the book value of the hedged loans held for sale is adjusted for its change in fair value during the hedge period 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure when financing our mortgage backed securities 
the swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges and carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
the fair values of our swap agreements are generally based on market prices provided by certain dealers who make markets on these financial instruments or third party pricing services 
if the fair value of a trading security is not reasonably available  management estimates the fair value  which requires management s judgment and may not be indicative of the amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets stemming from business acquisitions  including identifiable intangibles 
we test for impairment by comparing the fair value of goodwill  as determined by using a discounted cash flow method  with its carrying value 
any excess of carrying value over the fair value of the goodwill would be recognized as an impairment loss in continuing operations 
the discounted cash flow calculation related to our loan origination segment includes a forecast of the expected future loan originations and the related revenues and expenses 
the discounted cash flow calculation related to our mortgage backed securities holdings segment includes a forecast of the expected future net interest income  gain on mortgage backed securities and the related revenues and expenses 
these cash flows are discounted using a rate that is estimated to be a weighted average cost of capital for similar companies 
we further test to ensure that the fair value of all our business units does not exceed our total market capitalization 
financial condition prior to the company s reorganization as a reit and the merger with apex  our total assets consisted primarily of mortgage loans held for sale in the secondary market 
at december   of our total assets were mortgage backed securities and were mortgage loans held for sale  compared to and  respectively  at december  total assets increased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase primarily reflects mortgage backed securities totaling billion at december  and a billion rise in mortgage loans held for sale 
the growth in mortgage backed securities was primarily funded by an increase in reverse repurchase agreements of billion and a payable for mortgage backed securities purchased of billion 
the increase in loans held for sale was funded by a billion rise in warehouse lines of credit

the segment s business is the holding for net interest income of arm backed securities 
revenues 
total revenues for the mbs holdings segment were million  consisting entirely of million of gain on mortgage backed securities and million of net interest income 
loan origination segment the loan origination segment s primary business is the origination and sale of primarily one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the segment grew significantly in both organically and through acquisitions 
the historically low interest rates of resulted in record loan originations industry wide as record numbers of borrowers refinanced their mortgages and purchased new homes 
during  the segment acquired retail branches of principal residential mortgage  inc and the retail and wholesale branches of american mortgage llc  and also hired former employees of capitol commerce mortgage company 
total loan originations for were billion compared to billion for  a increase 
at december   the segment had loan origination offices and  employees compared with loan origination offices and  employees at december  gain on sales of mortgage loans 
the loan origination segment s primary source of revenue is the gain on sales of mortgage loans originated by the segment 
gain on sales of mortgage loans for totaled million on loan sales of billion  compared with million on sales of billion for the average gain on sale margin increased to for from for net interest income 
total interest income for on our loan origination segment s mortgages held for sale was million  compared to interest income for of million  an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily due to higher average loan inventory in our loan origination segment funds its loan inventory primarily through borrowing facilities with several mortgage warehouse lenders 
total interest expense for was million  compared to interest expense for of million  a increase  which was primarily due to increased borrowings to fund our loan inventory 
other revenue 
other revenue totaled million in compared to million in for the year ended december   other income primarily includes revenue from title services of million  fulfillment fees of million and volume incentive bonuses received from loan purchasers totaling approximately million 
the fulfillment fees represent non recurring fees received from principal residential mortgage  inc prm for loans closed by us on behalf of prm 
as part of the agreement to acquire the retail branches of prm the principal branches  we agreed to assume the costs incurred to close out prm s application pipeline as of the date of the agreement on behalf of prm for a per loan fee 
for the year ended december   other income primarily consists of revenue from title services of million and volume incentive bonuses received from loan purchasers totaling approximately million 
expenses 
total expenses of our loan origination segment for were million  or basis points of total loan originations  compared to million  or basis points of total loan originations  for we made significant investments in our infrastructure  particularly in information technology and corporate services  to support the growth of our loan origination segment 
our operating expenses represent costs that are not eligible to be added to the book value of the loans because they are not considered direct origination costs under the rules of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial costs of leases 
direct origination costs are added to the book value of loans and either reduce the gain on sale of loans if the loans are sold or are amortized over the life of the loan 
salaries  commissions and benefits for were million  or basis points of total loan originations  compared to million  or basis points of total loan originations  for operating expenses  excluding salaries  commissions and benefits  were basis points of total loan originations for both and loan servicing segment the loan servicing segment total revenues for the year ended december  were a loss of million compared to a loss of million in  an increase of million  or 
net loan servicing fees was a loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million for loan servicing fees increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of columbia for the full year in amortization increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of columbia for the full year in we recognized a temporary impairment recovery of million in versus an impairment provision of million in  resulting in an increase in net loan servicing fees of million 
this impairment recovery is due to an increase in the fair value of servicing rights attributable to a decrease in estimated future prepayment speeds 
expenses 
the loan servicing segment expenses are associated with the administration of the servicing portfolio acquired through our acquisition of columbia in june income taxes 
income tax benefit decreased to million in from a million benefit in  a decrease of million  or 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and loan origination segment revenues 
the loan origination segment total revenues for the year ended december   were million compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was a result of increases in gains on sale of mortgage loans  net interest income and other income 
gain on sales of mortgage loans increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
in general  the increase was the result of higher originations  sales and pipeline values  as well as improved margins 
the higher volumes were a result of lower interest rates which generated higher purchase and refinance volumes from existing locations 
additionally  the increase is attributable to the acquisition of columbia 
interest income  net  increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase resulted primarily from an increase in loans held for sale  an increase in our effective interest rate spread and the acquisition of columbia 
other revenue totaled million in compared to million in for the year ended december   other income primarily consists of revenue from title services in the amount of million and volume incentive bonuses received from loan purchasers totaling approximately million 
for the year ended december   other income primarily consists of volume incentive bonuses received from loan purchasers totaling approximately million 
expenses 
salaries  commissions and benefits increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was largely due to the inclusion of expenses of columbia  and increased staffing levels and overtime due to increased loan volumes 
as of december   we employed  loan origination employees compared to  loan origination employees at december  occupancy and equipment expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in costs reflects the inclusion of expenses of columbia  the opening of new community loan offices and greater depreciation charges as a result of our increased investments in computer networks 
marketing and promotion expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily due to increased loan volume and the inclusion of columbia expenses 
data processing and communication costs increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was a result of the inclusion of expenses of columbia and the opening of new community loan offices 
office supplies and expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was a result of the inclusion of expenses of columbia and the opening of new community loan offices 
professional fees increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of expenses of columbia 
travel and entertainment expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of expenses of columbia and the addition of new loan originators 
other expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
these expenses  which consist generally of insurance  indemnification and foreclosure costs  outside services  storage and moving expenses and licenses and permits  increased as a result of the inclusion of columbia  the opening of new community offices and higher loan origination 
income taxes 
income taxes increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
loan servicing segment our loan servicing segment was immaterial before the acquisition of columbia in june and thus the loan servicing segment results are included in the loan origination segment results in prior years 
revenues 
the loan servicing segment s total revenues for the year ended december   were a loss of million  which included a net loan servicing fees loss of million and interest expense  net  of million 
net loan servicing fees was a loss of million in the loan servicing portfolio was acquired as part of the columbia acquisition in june the servicing losses are a result of the reduction in interest rates since the acquisition which resulted in both faster actual prepayments and higher forecasted future prepayments than what were expected at the time of the acquisition 
the loss in primarily resulted from a temporary impairment provision of million due to a reduction in the fair value of servicing rights attributable to an increase in estimated future prepayment speeds and million amortization as a result of faster than expected loan repayments 
expenses 
these expenses are associated with the administration of the servicing portfolio acquired through the columbia acquisition in june income taxes 
income tax benefit was million in liquidity and capital resources we have arrangements to enter into reverse repurchase agreements  a form of collateralized short term borrowing  with different financial institutions and on december  had borrowed funds from five of these firms 
because we borrow money under these agreements based on the fair value of our mortgage backed securities  and because changes in interest rates can negatively impact the valuation of mortgage backed securities  our borrowing ability under these agreements could be limited and lenders could initiate margin calls in the event interest rates change or the value of our mortgage backed securities declines for other reasons 
as of december   we had billion of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding with a weighted average borrowing rate of and a weighted average remaining maturity of months 
to originate a mortgage loan  we draw against a billion pre purchase facility with ubs real estate securities inc formerly paine webber real estate securities inc ubs  a million bank syndicated facility led by residential funding corporation rfc  a million facility with cdc ixis capital markets north america inc cdc  a facility of million with morgan stanley bank morgan stanley and a facility of million with credit lyonnais 
these facilities are secured by the mortgages owned by us and by certain of our other assets 
advances drawn under the facilities bear interest at rates that vary depending on the type of mortgages securing the advances 
these loans are subject to sublimits  advance rates and terms that vary depending on the type of securing mortgages and the ratio of the company s liabilities to its tangible net worth 
at march   the aggregate outstanding balance under the warehouse facilities was billion  the aggregate outstanding balance in drafts payable was million and the aggregate maximum amount available for additional borrowings was million 
the documents governing our warehouse facilities contain a number of compensating balance requirements and restrictive financial and other covenants that  among other things  require us to adhere to a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth and liquidity  as well as to comply with applicable regulatory and investor requirements 
the facility agreements also contain covenants limiting the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer or sell assets other than in the ordinary course of business and to create liens on the collateral without obtaining the prior consent of the lenders  which consent may not be unreasonably withheld 
in addition  under our warehouse facilities  we cannot continue to finance a mortgage loan that we hold if o the loan is rejected as unsatisfactory for purchase by the ultimate investor and has exceeded its permissible day warehouse period  o we fail to deliver the applicable mortgage note or other documents evidencing the loan within the requisite time period  o the underlying property that secures the loan has sustained a casualty loss in excess of of its appraised value  or o the loan ceases to be an eligible loan as determined pursuant to the applicable warehousing agreement 
as of december   our aggregate warehouse facility borrowings were billion including million of borrowings under a working capital sub limit and our outstanding drafts payable were million  compared to million in borrowings and million in drafts payable as of december  at december   our loans held for sale were billion compared to million at december  in addition to the ubs  cdc  rfc  morgan stanley  and credit lyonnais warehouse facilities  we have a purchase and sale agreement with ubs 
this agreement allows us to accelerate the sale of our mortgage loan inventory  resulting in a more effective use of the warehouse facility 
amounts sold and being held under these agreements at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the amount so held under this agreement at march  was million 
this agreement is not a committed facility and may be terminated at the discretion of the counterparty 
we make certain representations and warranties under the purchase and sale agreements regarding  among other things  the loans compliance with laws and regulations  their conformity with the ultimate investors underwriting standards and the accuracy of information 
in the event of a breach of these representations or warranties or in the event of an early payment default  we may be required to repurchase the loans and indemnify the investor for damages caused by that breach 
we have implemented strict procedures to ensure quality control and conformity to underwriting standards and minimize the risk of being required to repurchase loans 
from time to time we have been required to repurchase loans that we sold  however  the liability for the fair value of those obligations has been immaterial 
we also have a million term loan facility with a bank syndicate led by rfc which we use to finance our mortgage servicing rights 
the term loan facility expires on may  interest is based on a spread to the libor and may be adjusted for earnings on escrow balances 
at december  and  borrowings under our term loan were million and million  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december   from million at december  our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   were as follows o billion increase in reverse repurchase agreements  o million increase in warehouse lines of credit  and o million increase in payable for mortgage backed securities purchased 
our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   were as follows o billion increase in mortgage backed securities  and o million net increase in mortgage loans held for sale 
cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december   from million at december  our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   were as follows o million increase in warehouse lines of credit  o million in proceeds from issuance of capital stock  and o million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   were as follows o million net increase in mortgage loans held for sale  o million for the acquisition of businesses  net of cash acquired  o million increase in accounts receivable  and o million decrease in notes payable 
our ability to originate loans depends in large part on our ability to sell these mortgage loans at par or for a premium in the secondary market so that we may generate cash proceeds to repay borrowings under our warehouse facilities 
the value of our loans depends on a number of factors  including o interest rates on our loans compared to market interest rates  o the borrower credit risk classification  o loan to value ratios  and o general economic conditions 
inflation for the period to  inflation has been relatively low and we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
to the extent inflation increases in the future  interest rates will also likely rise  which would reduce the number of loans we originate 
such a reduction would adversely affect our future results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is reasonably likely to be material to investors 
contractual obligations the company had the following contractual obligations excluding derivative financial instruments at december  less than after total year years years years in thousands warehouse facilities   operating leases      notes payable    reverse repurchase agreements   payable for securities purchased   risk management movements in interest rates can pose a major risk to us in either a rising or declining interest rate environment 
we depend on substantial borrowings to conduct our business 
these borrowings are all done at variable interest rate terms which will increase as short term interest rates rise 
additionally  when interest rates rise  loans held for sale and any applications in process with locked in rates decrease in value 
to preserve the value of such loans or applications in process with locked in rates  agreements are executed for mandatory loan sales to be settled at future dates with fixed prices 
these sales take the form of forward sales of mortgage backed securities 
when interest rates decline  fallout may occur as a result of customers withdrawing their applications 
in those instances  we may be required to purchase loans at current market prices to fulfill existing mandatory loan sale agreements  thereby incurring losses upon sale 
we use an interest rate hedging program to manage these risks 
through this program  mortgage backed securities are purchased and sold forward and options are acquired on treasury futures contracts 
in the event that we do not deliver into the forward delivery commitments or exercise our option contracts  the instruments can be settled on a net basis 
net settlement entails paying or receiving cash based upon the change in market value of the existing instrument 
all forward delivery commitments and option contracts to buy mortgage backed securities are to be contractually settled within six months of the balance sheet date 
our hedging program contains an element of risk because the counterparties to our mortgage and treasury securities transactions may be unable to meet their obligations 
while we do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparty  we are exposed to potential credit losses in the event the counterparty fails to perform 
our exposure to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty is the difference between the contract and the current market price 
we minimize our credit risk exposure by limiting the counterparties to well capitalized banks and securities dealers who meet established credit and capital guidelines 
movements in interest rates also impact the value of mortgage servicing rights 
when interest rates decline  the loans underlying the mortgage servicing rights are generally expected to prepay faster  which reduces the market value of the mortgage servicing rights 
we consider the expected increase in loan origination volumes and the resulting additional origination related income as a natural hedge against the expected change in the value of mortgage servicing rights 
lower mortgage rates generally reduce the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights  as increased prepayment speeds are highly correlated with lower levels of mortgage interest rates 
the company enters into interest rate swap agreements swap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure when financing its mortgage backed securities 
the company generally borrows money based on short term interest rates  by entering into borrowings with maturity terms of less than one year  and frequently to months 
the company s mortgage backed securities generally have an interest rate that reprices based on frequency terms of one to twelve months 
the company s mortgage backed securities have an initial fixed interest rate period of three to ten years 
when the company enters into a swap agreement  it generally agrees to pay a fixed rate of interest and to receive a variable interest rate  generally based on libor 
the notional balances of the swap agreements generally decline over the life of these instruments 
these swap agreements have the effect of converting the company s variable rate debt into fixed rate debt over the life of the swap agreements 
these instruments are used as a cost effective way to lengthen the average repricing period of the company s variable rate and short term borrowings such that the average repricing of the borrowings more closely matches the average repricing of the company s mortgage backed securities 
the following tables summarize the company s interest rate sensitive instruments as of december  and december  notional carrying estimated amount amount fair value in thousands assets mortgage backed securities    interest rate lock commitments    mortgage loans held for sale  net    mortgage servicing rights  net    liabilities reverse repurchase agreements    forward delivery commitments loan commitments    forward delivery commitments loans held for sale    interest rate swaps    december  notional carrying estimated amount amount fair value in thousands assets interest rate lock commitments    option contracts to buy securities  mortgage loans held for sale  net    mortgage servicing rights  net    liabilities forward delivery commitments loan commitments    forward delivery commitments loans held for sale    management s fair value estimates are made as of a specific point in time based on present value or other valuation techniques 
these techniques involve uncertainties and are significantly affected by the assumptions used and the judgments made regarding risk characteristics of various financial instruments  discount rates  estimates of future cash flows  future expected loss experience and other factors 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates and the resulting fair values 
derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and  in many cases  could not be realized in an immediate sale of the instrument 
also  because of differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values  the fair values used by the company should not be compared to those of other companies 
a further discussion of the methods and assumptions we use to estimate the above financial instruments is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
newly issued accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no

 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements fin no 
 which was revised in december this interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies when specific characteristics are met 
fin no 
clarifies the application of arb no 
to certain entities with equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin no 
were effective february  for new and modified vies and july  for other entities 
the implementation of fin no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments that certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures are required for equity and fixed maturity securities that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
the guidance requires companies to disclose the aggregate amount of unrealized losses and the related fair value of investments with unrealized losses for securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than months and separately for those that have been in an unrealized loss position for over months  by investment category 
the company has adopted these disclosure requirements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 which provides guidance regarding loan commitments that are accounted for as derivative instruments under sfas no 
as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in sab no 
 the sec stated that the value of expected future cash flows related to servicing rights should be excluded when determining the fair value of derivative interest rate lock commitments 
this guidance must be applied to rate locks initiated after march  under the new policy  the value of the expected future cash flow related to servicing rights is not recognized until the underlying loans are sold 
the impact that this new policy will have on the company s results of operations in the second quarter of will be influenced by that quarter s amount of rate lock volume associated with loans expected to be sold and by the timing of when loan sales are executed 
as rate lock volume is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and the timing of loan sales may be affected by market conditions  the company cannot provide a reliable estimate of the impact this change will have to its results of operations in the second quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required to be included in this item a regarding quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is included in item of this report  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management
