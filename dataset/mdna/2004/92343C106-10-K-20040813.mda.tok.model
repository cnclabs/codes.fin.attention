overview we are a leading provider of intellectual capital management software that enables our customers to maximize their return on their information assets 
the intellectual capital management software market is in great part the convergence of many core markets in which we have participated for years  including search  corporate portals  and e commerce  as well as markets we have recently entered  including question and answer interfaces  and content capture and process automation  among others 
we develop  market and support two product families intelligent content services which we refer to as ics  and content capture and process automation 
intelligent content services are search  classification  recommendation  monitoring alerting  and question and answer infrastructure products for corporate intranets  extranets  web sites  corporate portals  business applications  online publishers and e commerce providers and original equipment manufacturer oem toolkits for independent software vendors 
our comprehensive and integrated ics product family enables numerous enterprise wide functionalities  all from the same underlying verity information index 
our ics products organize and provide simple  single point access to information across the entire enterprise 
in doing so  our products can be used to create or enhance business portals and standalone applications that leverage the value of existing investments in intranets and business applications 
content capture and process automation applications enable the information on paper and electronic forms to be captured in electronic form  and for manual processes that utilized that information to be automated over corporate networks 
our content capture and process automation products include capabilities for forms design  scanning  optical character recognition  forms recognition  validation  verification  workflow and routing 
our software has been licensed to over  corporations  government agencies  software developers  information publishers and e commerce vendors 
we pursue sales opportunities within corporations and government agencies through the efforts of our direct sales force and through a network of value added resellers and system integrators 
we also sell oem toolkits to independent software vendors that embed verity technology in their products or services 
we were organized as a california corporation in march and reincorporated in delaware in september our principal executive offices are located at ross drive  sunnyvale  california  and our telephone number is internal controls we have historically considered our internal controls over financial reporting a high priority and will continue to do so through a continual review of and resulting improvement in our internal controls 
for example  we have formed a sarbanes oxley steering committee  comprised primarily of senior financial and operational personnel and governed by our audit committee  which helps ensure our internal controls over financial reporting  are complete  accurate and appropriately documented 
we are in the process of assessing our business processes relating to our financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  or sox 
in accordance with sox  we will test our internal controls each year and  beginning with our fiscal year ending may  recent acquisitions cardiff software inc on march   we acquired cardiff software inc  a privately held software company 
cardiff software technology enables the automated capture of dynamic business information 
although the cardiff software corporate brand has been discontinued  we have retained the product names and rebranded them as verity teleform  verity liquidoffice  verity liquidcapture  and verity mediclaim 
support and maintenance services for existing cardiff software customers will remain in place 
this acquisition further expanded our offerings with the content capture and process automation product family 
the acquired software  rebranded verity teleform  verity mediclaim  verity liquidoffice and verity liquidcapture  is in use by companies and government organizations of all sizes 
we are continuing development and support of these products  and believe that the larger enterprises in the installed base represent an upgrade opportunity to our broader intellectual capital management solutions as their needs grow 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we accounted for the cardiff software transaction as a purchase  and the total purchase consideration of approximately million including cash  deferred payments  stock options assumed and acquisition costs was allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based upon their estimated fair value as of the date of completion of the acquisition and the residual of million was recorded as goodwill 
the million of total purchase consideration  includes approximately million placed into a third party escrow account to be paid to cardiff software s shareholders in installments over months from the acquisition 
these future payments are subject to cardiff software meeting certain obligations outlined under the representations and warranties covenants sections of the definitive merger agreement 
we believe that cardiff software will meet these obligations and therefore the entire million has been recorded as purchase consideration 
nativeminds inc on march   we acquired the intellectual property  customer agreements and other selective strategic assets from nativeminds inc  a privately held software company and provider of integrated self service solutions 
the acquired technology portfolio originally named vrep  re branded verity response  is an integrated set of tools designed to provide a single interface for internal and external customer inquiries through a natural language dialog 
verity response includes technology that manages the interaction between a customer and virtual representative and a set of reporting and analysis tools to help assess performance  identify content opportunities and gather valuable customer insight 
we are continuing development and support of the products acquired and believe that the larger enterprises in the installed base represent an upgrade opportunity to our broader intellectual capital management solution as their needs grow 
in accordance with sfas no  business combinations  we accounted for the nativeminds transaction as a purchase  and the total purchase consideration of approximately million including cash  deferred payments  acquisition costs was allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based upon their estimated fair value as of the date of completion and the residual of million was recorded as goodwill 
the million of total purchase consideration includes approximately million to be paid to nativemind s shareholders in installments over months from the acquisition 
these future payments are subject to nativeminds meeting certain obligations outlined under the representations and warranties section of the definitive merger agreement 
of this million  million was paid in the fourth fiscal quarter of we believe that nativeminds will meet the remaining obligations and therefore have recorded the entire million as purchase consideration 
inktomi corporation 
in december  we acquired the enterprise search assets of inktomi corporation  further expanding our product portfolio to include solutions for smaller organizations and departments within larger enterprises 
in addition to addressing these markets  the acquired enterprise search software  re branded verity ultraseek  is in use at a number of larger enterprises for search only applications as well 
we are continuing development and support of the ultraseek product line  and believe that the larger enterprises in the installed base represent an upgrade opportunity to our broader intellectual capital management solutions as their needs grow 
we purchased the enterprise search assets from inktomi corporation for approximately million in cash  of which million  plus  in interest  was paid in our first fiscal quarter of we expensed million to in process research and development in process r d upon acquisition  and have been amortizing the expense of purchased intangible assets at a rate of approximately million per year  which we expect to continue through fiscal  with the remaining million to be amortized in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  income taxes and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition our revenues are derived from license fees for our software products and fees for services complementary to our products  including software maintenance  consulting and training 
we also derive nominal revenue from hardware product sales complementary to our software products 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
the aicpa and its software revenue recognition task force continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
also  the securities and exchange commission sec has issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
delivery generally occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier or made available to the customer for electronic download 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
for all sales  we use either a binding purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support and product upgrades ratably over the term of the applicable maintenance agreement  which is typically twelve months 
generally  we receive payments for maintenance fees in advance and they are nonrefundable 
we recognize revenues for consulting and training generally when the services are performed 
we recognize revenue for hardware sales generally when the product is delivered 
for agreements with multiple elements  such as license  maintenance  training  hardware and consulting services  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately 
we defer revenue for any undelivered elements  and recognize revenue when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for such element 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software  hardware and service arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and all services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
sales commission expense sales commission expense is a variable expense and a significant portion of our overall sales and marketing expense 
in addition to base salaries  our worldwide sales force is eligible to receive variable compensation based on pre established annual quota attainment 
on a periodic basis  we accrue estimated sales commission expense and pay out the actual expense in future periods once actual attainment has been calculated and reviewed 
actual quota attainments and therefore actual commission payments may differ from our estimated accrual based on certain factors such as mix of revenue contribution by sales representatives and accelerator provisions for overachievement of quotas 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for the potential inability of our worldwide direct customers and channel partners to make required payments based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable 
in estimating the provision  management considers i historical experience  ii the length of time the receivables are past due  iii any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  and iv other known factors 
we review this provision periodically to assess the adequacy of the provision 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million at may  and  respectively 
these balances each represent approximately of both our of fiscal and fiscal revenues 
these amounts were determined as described above 
however  if a single significant direct customer or channel partner is unable or unwilling to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accordingly  the inability of a single direct customer or channel partner to make required payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically make an assessment of the probability of an adverse judgment resulting from current and threatened litigation 
we accrue the cost of an adverse judgment if  in our estimation and based on the advice of legal counsel  the adverse settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of such a judgment 
as of may  we have not accrued for any estimated settlement or judgment as management does not believe amounts are probable and estimable 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
our income tax accounting process involves our recording the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we evaluate this deferred tax asset at each balance sheet date to determine its realizability  considering currently enacted tax laws  expected future taxable income and origins of the specific components of the deferred tax asset 
if we determine that it is not fully realizable  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the asset balance to its realizable value through a charge to income tax expense 
determining whether we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carryforward requires that we estimate future taxable income and make judgments regarding the timing of future tax obligations 
actual taxable income could differ from our estimates 
as of may   we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the majority of our tax assets through expected future taxable profits 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million for the remainder of our tax assets 
the recognition of deferred tax assets originated from stock compensation has been recorded to additional paid in capital 
if we conclude that additional valuation allowance is required in the future  the effect on income tax expense could be material 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we record goodwill and identifiable purchased intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets such as purchased technology and maintenance agreements are amortized to operating expense over time  while in process research and development is recorded as an expense on the acquisition date 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard eliminates the amortization of goodwill and requires goodwill to be reviewed at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we move on to step if the unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess 
we perform an annual impairment review in our third fiscal quarter and periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets 
we have completed the required annual impairment test  which resulted in no impairment for fiscal year we believe the methodology we use in testing impairment of goodwill provides us with reasonable basis in determining whether an impairment charge should be taken in the future  however  there can be no assurance that at the time that the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be required and recorded 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenue represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended may  revenues software products service and other total revenues costs of revenues software products service and other amortization of purchased intangible assets total costs of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and sales general and administrative in process research and development charge restructuring charge charitable contribution total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended may   and in fiscal years and  our management information systems mis operations expense was fully allocated to our research and development organization 
beginning in fiscal year  we allocated our total mis expenses throughout our organization  in order to more closely match the practices of other software companies 
when compared with fiscal years and  these allocations had the net effect in fiscal year of reducing our research and development expenses  and increasing expenses of costs of software products  costs of service and other  marketing and sales and general and administrative 
our worldwide mis expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits  capital equipment related expensed or depreciated  including associated maintenance contracts and rentals and corporate overhead allocations 
in fiscal year  these expenses were approximately million per quarter 
fiscal year and fiscal year mis operating expenses have been reclassified to conform with the presentation 
revenues total revenues percent change percent change dollars in millions total revenues the increase in total revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to a million increase in our software product revenues and to a million increase in our service and other revenues 
in practice  our management tracks most closely and calculates our average selling prices only for those deals which total  or more in total deal size product and services 
the increase in total revenue was the result of an increase in the total number of customer transactions for deal sizes greater than  combined with a marginal increase in the average revenue per transaction 
fiscal year results include a full year of revenues for our ultraseek product  whereas fiscal year results include revenues from only the latter six months of fiscal  as the acquisition of the assets from inktomi corporation occurred in the middle of fiscal also  fiscal year results include the addition of our suite of content capture products  which were derived from the purchase of cardiff software in march and to a much lesser extent the vrep product which was derived came from the purchase of nativeminds 
additionally  fiscal year includes a payment in the first quarter from broadvision of past royalties in connection with the settlement of outstanding litigation  which was less than of revenues for the full year period 
for fiscal year  we expect our total revenues to increase as a result of an increase in volumes of transactions of deal sizes greater than  and to a lesser extent  increased volumes and revenues associated with transaction less than  we expect volumes of transactions and total revenues to increase as we expect to maintain a growth rate consistent with the overall growth rates with the markets we serve as well we expect to see increased revenue from a full year worth of cardiff software products and the nativemind product that we acquired in march of these expectations are based on assumptions we believe are reasonable  but actual results may differ from our expectations as a result of the risks set forth in risks relating to our operations at the end of item of this form k 
the increase in total revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to a million increase in our software product revenues and to a million increase in our service and other revenues 
the increase was the result of an increase in the total number of customer transactions combined with a relatively smaller reduction in the average revenue per transaction 
fiscal year results include the addition of our ultraseek product  which came from the purchase of assets and obligations of inktomi corporation s enterprise search software business in december international revenues represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively and no single customer accounted for or more of our revenues during fiscal years  or revenues derived from sales to the federal government and its agencies were  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales to government agencies will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in the future 
software product revenues percent change percent change dollars in millions software product revenues percentage of total revenues our software product revenues consist primarily of fees for software licenses and to a lesser extent  the sale of hardware scanners associated with the acquisition of cardiff software 
we saw an increase in demand for our software products in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year the increase in software product revenues during this period was due primarily to the following increased number of sales transactions  in combination with increased average selling price for transactions greater than  increased sales to our oem customers  increased sales of our ultraseek product  which we did not have prior to our acquisition of the enterprise search assets of inktomi corporation in december  and incremental sales of our suite of content capture products  which we did not have prior to our acquisition of cardiff software in march in addition  software product revenues for fiscal year included the recognition of revenue in the first quarter of past royalties in connection with our confidential settlement with broadvision related to our outstanding litigation 
this revenue accounted for less than of total revenues in the period 
the modest increase in software product revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year resulted primarily from sales of our ultraseek product  which we did not have prior to our acquisition of enterprise search assets of inktomi corporation in december this increase was offset in part by a decrease in sales of our k product application and to decreased oem royalties 
service and other revenues percent change percent change dollars in millions service and other revenues percentage of total revenues our service and other revenues consist primarily of fees for software maintenance  consulting and training 
the increase in service and other revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to million in increased sales of consulting services and to million in increased maintenance revenues 
this increase resulted primarily from increased maintenance contracts associated with our increase in software product revenues and from maintenance contracts acquired as part of our acquisitions of cardiff software and assets from nativeminds 
the increase in service and other revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to million in increased sales of consulting services and to million in increased maintenance revenues which resulted primarily from maintenance contracts acquired as part of the purchase of enterprise search assets of inktomi corporation 
costs of revenues costs of software products percent change percent change dollars in millions costs of software products percentage of software product revenues costs of software products consist primarily of product media  duplication  manuals  packaging materials  shipping expenses  employee compensation expenses  royalties paid to third party vendors  and in certain instances  licensing of third party software incorporated in our products 
also included in costs of software products  to a lesser extent  is the cost of the hardware scanners which we began selling as a result of the acquisition of cardiff software beginning march  we believe that costs of software products will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased royalties paid to third party software vendors and to increased costs associated with the additional forecasted revenues 
additionally  we expect an increase in the costs of software products as a percentage of software product revenues resulting from the increased royalties cost of third party software vendors relating to cardiff software s product line 
the increase in costs of software products in absolute dollars for fiscal year  compared with the prior fiscal year  was primarily attributable to higher average cost associated with our newly acquired content management software  coupled with a million increase in costs of third party royalties and a million increase in costs for manuals and product media associated with the product release of verity k enterprise the decrease in costs of software products in absolute dollars and as a percentage of software product revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was attributable to million in decreased costs of third party software components and to million in decreased costs for manuals and other shipping expenses from the prior periods which had approximately million in total one time costs associated with the start up of european distribution operations 
in fiscal years  and  we did not capitalize any software development costs since such costs were not material 
costs of service and other percent change percent change dollars in millions costs of service and other percentage of service and other revenues costs of service and other consists of costs incurred in providing consulting services  customer training  telephone support and product upgrades to customers 
significant cost components include personnel related and third party contractor costs  facilities costs  travel expenses associated with training and consulting implementation services  depreciation expense and corporate overhead allocations 
the increase in costs of service and other in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to a million increase in compensation and other employee related expenses  primarily as a result of the cardiff software acquisition 
also contributing to the increase was million in additional costs associated with using third party contractors to provide professional services 
the decrease as a percentage of service and other revenues was related to higher margins associated with cardiff software services 
the increase in costs of service and other in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to increased compensation and other employee related expenses resulting from a slightly higher average headcount 
the higher average headcount resulted from the addition of personnel necessary to respond to increased demand for services and in connection with the purchase of the enterprise search assets from inktomi corporation purchase in december this compares with the prior year period in which headcount began at a higher level than at any time during the first two quarters of fiscal year  but was reduced during our staffing reorganization during the quarter ended november  amortization of purchased intangible assets percent change percent change dollars in millions amortization of purchased intangible assets nm percentage total revenues during fiscal year  we amortized million of the purchased intangible assets in connection with acquired technology  patents and maintenance agreements from our inktomi  cardiff software and nativeminds acquisitions 
we will record quarterly amortization expenses of million associated with the purchased intangible assets of the enterprise search assets of inktomi corporation over the estimated useful life of five years  million associated with the purchased intangible assets of cardiff software over the estimated useful life of four years  and million associated with the purchased intangible assets of nativeminds over the estimated useful life of four years 
the estimated future amortization expense of purchased intangible assets as of may  is as follows in thousands fiscal year amount total operating expenses research and development percent change percent change dollars in millions research and development percentage of total revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits  payments to outside contractors  depreciation on equipment used for development and corporate overhead allocations 
we believe that research and development is essential to maintaining our competitive position and we will continue to make significant investments in research and development with the goal of continuing to align research and development expenses with anticipated revenues 
beyond our first quarter of fiscal  we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase modestly resulting from annual compensation increases 
the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to additional cardiff software related expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal which was substantially offset by a decrease in compensation and other employee related expenses associated with the reduction in staffing in our research and development organization in november the decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and other employee related expenses associated with the reduction in staffing in our research and development organization during each of november and  offset in part by the addition of personnel in connection with the enterprise purchase during the quarter ended february marketing and sales percent change percent change dollars in millions marketing and sales percentage of total revenues marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  including sales commissions and benefits  tradeshows  outbound marketing and other lead generation activities  public relations  travel expenses associated with our sales staff and corporate overhead allocations 
we anticipate that we will continue to make significant investments in marketing and sales with the goal of continuing to align marketing and sales expenses with anticipated revenues 
beyond our first quarter of fiscal  we anticipate that marketing and sales expenses will increase modestly as a result of planned annual compensation increases and from planned increased headcount and lead generation activities necessary to support our increased revenue projections in the second half of fiscal the increase in marketing and sales expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in sales commissions resulting from the combination of higher revenue and an increased commission payout rate 
additionally  million of the increase was attributable to compensation related increases and million from allocations  both due to a higher average headcount 
also contributing to the increase was million from higher lead generation and sales expenses  million from increased travel expenses and million from increased depreciation expenses 
the decrease in marketing and sales expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to a million decrease in compensation and other employee related expenses associated with the reduction in staffing in our marketing and sales organization during the quarters ended november  and  and the transfer of our current ceo from marketing and sales to the general and administrative organization  offset in part by the addition of personnel in connection with the purchase of the enterprise assets of inktomi corporation during the quarter ended february  general and administrative percent change percent change dollars in millions general and administrative percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  legal  human resources and general management  provisions for doubtful accounts  insurance  fees for external professional advisors and corporate overhead allocations 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to the additional expenses related to the cardiff software acquisition that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year additionally  public company expenses ie audit and tax fees  insurance  and investor relations expenses increased approximately million over the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to a million decrease in expenses for outside professional services including legal fees  and audit and tax fees and a million decrease in bad debt expense 
this was offset in part by a million increase in insurance costs  increased compensation costs associated with the addition of personnel in connection with the purchase of the enterprise assets of inktomi corporation during the quarter ended february  and increased costs associated with transferring our ceo to the general and administrative organization from marketing and sales 
in process research and development percent change percent change dollars in millions in process research and development nm percentage of total revenues of the total in process research and development expense of million for fiscal year  approximately million was attributable to the cardiff software purchase and approximately million was attributable to the nativeminds purchase 
total in process research and development expense of million for fiscal year was attributable to the inktomi purchase 
the methodology for allocating the purchase price to in process research and development is determined through established valuation techniques as outlined in the in process r d practice aid published by the american institute of certified public accountants  inc aicpa  as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the fair value allocation to in process research and development was determined  and expensed upon acquisition  by identifying the research projects for which technological feasibility had not been achieved and which had no alternative future use at the acquisition date  assessing the stage and expected date of completion of the research and development effort at the acquisition date  and calculating the net present value of the cash flows by discounting expected future cash flows to present value expected to result from the successful deployment of the new technology resulting from the in process research and development effort 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis and venture capital surveys  adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle based on each in process research and development project s stage of completion 
the development of the acquired in process research and development remains a significant risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technical feasibility  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats from several companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of completing the software development relating to the planned new functionalities  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
the key assumptions underlying the valuations for our acquisitions primarily consisted of an expected completion date for the in process research and development projects  estimated costs to complete these projects  revenue and expense projections assuming the products have entered the market  and discount rates based on the risks associated with the stage of completion of the in process technology acquired 
restructuring charge percent change percent change dollars in millions severance costs legal and other outside services costs adjustments to estimates nm nm facilities and other charges nm restructuring charge percentage of total revenues we had two restructuring activities in fiscal as a result of our cardiff software acquisition  we recorded a million restructuring charge related to positions we identified to be redundant in our the quarter ended may  the anticipated cost savings resulting from this restructuring consist of reduced compensation expenses from the affected employees  offset by any subsequent headcount additions 
in november  we implemented a worldwide restructuring to focus on reducing expenses and improving efficiency due to continued macro economic and capital spending issues affecting the software industry 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded a million restructuring in our quarter ended november  of which approximately million was related to severance costs associated with the reduction in the worldwide workforce by approximately employees and approximately million to legal and other outside services 
in november  we implemented a worldwide restructuring to focus on reducing expenses and improving efficiency due to continued macro economic and capital spending issues affecting the software industry 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded in the quarter ended november   a million restructuring charge  of which approximately million was related to severance costs associated with the reduction in the worldwide workforce by approximately employees  approximately million to legal and other outside services in connection with the restructuring  and approximately million to other costs associated with the restructuring 
the restructuring impacted operations in the us  canada and the netherlands and was concentrated in research and development and  to a lesser extent  sales and marketing 
during november  we implemented a worldwide restructuring and recorded a million restructuring charge  of which approximately million was related to severance costs associated with the reduction in the worldwide workforce by employees  approximately million to legal and other outside services in connection with the restructuring and approximately million to other costs associated with the restructuring 
the restructuring impacted operations in the us  canada  the us  germany  france  the netherlands  sweden and south africa  primarily in marketing and sales  and research and development 
as of may   million  million and million of the restructuring charges remain to be paid out from the restructuring charges recorded in fiscal  and  respectively 
none of these restructuring charges is expected to have a material impact on our future results of operations  liquidity or sources or uses of capital 
charitable contribution percent change percent change dollars in millions charitable contribution nm nm percentage of total revenues on september   we made a million donation to help the victims of the september th terrorist attacks in new york  pennsylvania  and washington dc our donation kicked off the united way silicon valley response fund 
the donation provided immediate support to established emergency assistance agencies  such as the american red cross and salvation army  both of which are founding members of the united way locally and nationally 
other income  net percent change percent change dollars in millions other income  net percentage of total revenues other income consists primarily of interest income and realized gains from our investments in marketable securities as well as transaction gains and losses associated with foreign currency fluctuations with associated with our benelux and canadian subsidiaries offset by our foreign currency hedging activity 
while we engage in simple hedging activities to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuation on our consolidated statements of operations  there is no assurance that a significant change in foreign currency exchange rates may not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations in the future 
the decrease in other income in absolute dollars from fiscal year through fiscal year was primarily due to decreasing overall yields on our portfolio of marketable securities caused by the decreasing interest rate environment 
income tax provision percent change percent change dollars in millions income tax provision percentage of total revenues effective tax rate income tax provision includes us and foreign income taxes 
certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year

beginning in fiscal year  we allocated our total mis expenses throughout our organization  in order to more closely match the practices of other software companies 
when compared with fiscal years and  these allocations had the net effect in fiscal year of reducing our research and development expenses  and increasing expenses of costs of software products  costs of service and other  marketing and sales and general and administrative 
our worldwide mis expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits  capital equipment related expensed or depreciated  including associated maintenance contracts and rentals and corporate overhead allocations

changes in working captial including other accrued liabilities  prepaid and other assets and deferred revenue collectively generated cash flow of million 
these cash flow generating activities were offset by cash outflows in our working capital including a increase in accounts receivable  primarily resulting from our year over year increase in revenues  million relating to accrued compensation and million due to accounts payable 
cash provided by operating activities increased to million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year this million increase was primarily due to the increase in net income of million  the effect on cash flow of which was further increased by approximately million due to greater non cash expenses  offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities  comprised mostly of a million decrease in accounts receivable in fiscal year compared to only a million decrease in fiscal year we expect we will have positive cash flows from operating activities in  as we believe we will be profitable for this time period and do not expect significant changes in working capital that would more than offset the forecasted cash flow generating capacity of our operations in fiscal cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year of million was primarily due to the sales and maturity of marketable securities  partially offset by the purchases of marketable securities and million for the purchase of cardiff software and nativeminds

our board of directors has authorized a million stock repurchase program in fiscal although we are not obligated to make any repurchases under this program  if we do make the majority of the repurchases authorized then we expect to use cash in financing activities in our principal commitments as of may  consist of obligations under operating leases  totaling million over the life of these leases 
we have no long term debt obligations or capital lease obligations 
under our operating leases  we have minimum rental payments as follows fiscal year ending may  rental payments sublease income and thereafter contractual obligations at may  were as follows dollars in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases deferred purchase payment total contractual cash obligations on december   we completed the purchase of certain assets and obligations of inktomi corporation s enterprise search software business

in april  we paid million and we are obligated to pay the remaining million in september of in fiscal  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock through open market transactions for a total of million 
our previous program  initiated on september   terminated at may  under that program  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock through open market transactions  valued at approximately million 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  interest income and cash generated from operations  if any  will provide adequate liquidity to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements through at least fiscal if the global economy weakens further  our cash  cash equivalents and investments balances may decline 
as a result  or if our spending plans materially change  we may find it necessary to reduce costs or seek to obtain additional sources of financing to support our capital needs  but we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds  none of which we hold for trading purposes 
as of may   approximately of our portfolio matures in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than three years 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of may  fy fy fy total fair value in thousands cash and cash equivalents average interest rate fixed rate securities average interest rate variable rate securities average interest rates during fiscal year  our cash equivalents and investments decreased by million in total value from fiscal year this decrease in value of our portfolio resulted from the purchase of cardiff software and nativeminds 
commensurate with the decrease in value  the composition of our portfolio changed in that our fixed rate securities decreased by million while our combined cash and cash equivalents and variable rate investments increased by million as a result of the decrease in the amount of fixed rate securities  the amount of interest we earn on our portfolio as of may  will be more responsive to interest rate fluctuations as compared to may   but the value of the portfolio will be less responsive to interest rate fluctuation 
by policy  we strive to maintain a diverse portfolio with limits on maximum individual security duration and weighted average portfolio maturity

we transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts  to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
these foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts non equity hedges are marked to market at the end of the period with any changes in market value included in other expense  net 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
net foreign exchange transaction loss included in other expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were million million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts was million and million as of may  and  respectively
