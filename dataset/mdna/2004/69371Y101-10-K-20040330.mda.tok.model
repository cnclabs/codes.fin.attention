item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we encourage you to read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this annual report 
our discussion of results of operations and financial condition includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products and services and our future results 
we based these statements on assumptions that we consider reasonable 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our forward looking statements for various reasons  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere 
introduction as described more fully under business  we are a high value  independent broadband provider of integrated communications services within our target markets 
our customers include internet service providers and enhanced communications service providers  collectively referred to as service providers  
table of contents or sps  and the enterprise market  also referred to as the small and medium sized enterprises  sme business  many of which are communications intensive users 
fiscal was an eventful year for us 
while our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to from million for the year ended december  largely as a result of decreases in reciprocal compensation payments received from incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  we continue to increase the number of lines in service and minutes of use on our network with total ds lines in service increasing to  as of december  and billable minutes of use up to billion for the year ended december  in addition  as described more fully below  in december  we sold to deutsche bank a senior secured note in the principal amount of million and warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  and used the proceeds to repurchase a significant portion of our series b senior notes due  which we refer to as the senior notes  as part of a tender offer 
the following table shows financial performance and noteworthy items in thousands except per share amounts financial performance revenues net loss income diluted net loss income per share noteworthy items ilec revenue settlements received restructuring and asset impairment charges loss gain on repurchase of bonds earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  net  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
for the years ended december   and ebitda was million  million and million  respectively 
although ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  we believe ebitda is a common measure used by analysts and investors to evaluate our capacity to meet our obligations 
we also use ebitda as an internal measurement tool and accordingly  we believe that the presentation of ebitda provides useful and relevant information 
the table included in item above reconciles ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities 
in december  we successfully completed an important financing transaction which permitted us to reduce our debt level and future cash interest expense 
in particular  on december   we sold to deutsche bank ag new york  acting through db advisors  llc  as investment advisor  deutsche bank  a senior secured note in the principal amount of million  which we refer to as the senior secured note  and warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the guarantee and security agreement grants deutsche bank a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
we used the net proceeds of this financing transaction  million in cash less certain expenses  together with our own cash  to complete a tender offer for million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes 
in connection with the tender offer  we also solicited consents to effect certain proposed amendments to the indenture governing the senior notes 
these amendments to the indenture governing the senior notes  which are now effective  eliminated most of the indenture s principal restrictive covenants and amended some other provisions contained in the indenture 
we derive our revenues from monthly recurring charges  usage charges and amortization of initial non recurring charges 
we provide services to both retail and wholesale customers 
monthly recurring 
table of contents charges include the fees paid by customers for lines in service and additional features on those lines  as well as equipment collocation services 
usage charges consist of fees paid by end users for each call made  fees paid by our intercarrier customers as reciprocal compensation for completion of their customers calls through our network  and access charges paid by carriers for long distance traffic terminated on our network 
initial non recurring charges consist of fees paid by end users for the installation of our service 
these payments and related costs up to the amount of revenues are recognized as revenue and expense ratably over the term of the service contracts  which is generally to months 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the product or performance of the service has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also have intercarrier customers who pay us to terminate their originating call traffic on our network 
these payments consist of meet point  transit traffic and reciprocal compensation payments  collectively referred to as reciprocal compensation 
reciprocal compensation payments are a function of the number of calls we terminate  the minutes of use associated with such calls and the rates we are compensated at by the ilecs 
reciprocal compensation payments have historically been a significant portion of our revenues but the intercarrier payments are not currently a targeted customer 
in particular  reciprocal compensation payments accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result  the failure  for any reason  of one or more ilecs from which we ordinarily receive reciprocal compensation payments to make all or a significant portion of such payments would adversely affect our financial results 
our right to receive reciprocal compensation payments from ilecs  as well as the right of other clecs to receive such payments is the subject of numerous regulatory and legal challenges 
for example  in  verizon and sbc attempted to adopt the federal communications commission s  or fcc s  intercarrier isp compensation order 
the fcc isp order introduced a series of declining reciprocal compensation pricing tiers for minutes of use  at rates starting below the rates previously negotiated in our interconnection agreements icas with both carriers 
the lowest pricing tier specified by the fcc isp order was reached on june   will remain in effect until such time that a replacement fcc isp order may become effective 
additionally  the fcc isp order introduced artificial annual growth limits on compensable minutes of use subject to reciprocal compensation based on the composition and balance of traffic between carriers 
based on verizon s interpretation of the growth cap formula  verizon commenced withholding of reciprocal compensation payments to us for the final five months and sbc commenced withholding for the final month in we are disputing these withheld reciprocal compensation payments and have challenged the legality of the growth caps as well as verizon s and sbc s implementation of the fcc isp order  however  there are no assurances that we will ever receive these withheld reciprocal compensation payments 
we expect that sbc and verizon may also withhold reciprocal compensation payments in and beyond once we have exceeded their calculation of the growth cap 
in addition  the rates upon which reciprocal compensation payments are determined are generally under downward pressure 
for example  on may   the california public utilities commission  or cpuc  implemented an unbundled network element pricing structure for local traffic exchanged with sbc in california 
the impact of this pricing structure had a significant negative impact on the reciprocal compensation revenue recognized subsequent to the ruling 
our tax affairs are subject to audit and review by numerous taxing authorities  including the internal revenue service irs 
an irs audit of our tax returns for  and is currently ongoing 
the irs may propose certain adjustments  which could be material in amount  in connection with its audit of these periods 
if such adjustments were to be proposed by the irs  we expect that we would vigorously defend the tax returns as filed 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend our tax positions 
if we were unsuccessful in defending our tax returns as filed  we 
table of contents may be assessed a significant tax liability for one or more of the periods under audit  which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 
as technology continues to evolve with the corresponding development of new products and services  there is no guarantee we will retain our customers with our existing product and service offerings or with any new products or services we may develop in the future 
while the demand for internet access in our target markets continues to grow  the demand for dial up internet access has slowed in recent years 
the introduction of broadband and voice over internet protocol voip  could further effect the growth of our existing dial up access to the internet and our switched local and long distance voice products 
voip utilizes high speed data networks rather than traditional phone lines to complete calls  offering customers enhanced functionality and potential cost savings over traditional carrier networks 
voip services are rapidly gaining momentum in the enterprise market as the quality and reliability continue to improve and broadband becomes more affordable 
in this regard  in the fourth quarter of we entered into a joint operating agreement with sentient group  inc sentient to jointly develop opportunities for the application of voip services to the enterprise market  and in the first quarter of we acquired substantially all of the assets  and assumed certain specified liabilities of sentient 
regulatory uncertainty and competition in the communication services market has resulted in the consolidation of clecs  a trend we expect to continue 
in order to grow our business and better serve our customers  we continue to consider new business models and strategies  including potential acquisitions or new business lines 
we believe that the statewide footprint of our network  which encompasses all of the major metropolitan areas of california  provides us with a significant competitive advantage that will enable us to successfully compete in the future  but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to sustain continued growth 
results of operations the following table summarizes the results of operations as a percentage of our revenues for the years ended december   and income loss from operations for  and includes restructuring and impairment charges totaling million  million and million  respectively

the total ds equivalent lines in service lines increased to  as of december  from  lines as of december  due to our continued success at attracting new customers and retaining existing customers 
billable minutes of use were billion for the year ended december   up from billion billed minutes during due to both the increased number of lines in service and higher average traffic volume per line on a year over year basis 
of these minutes  billion and billion were subject to reciprocal compensation in and  respectively 
the following table describes the main components of our reciprocal compensation revenues for the years ended december  and in thousands excepts minutes of use change minutes of use subject to reciprocal compensation revenue billions average reciprocal compensation per minute of use amounts withheld from prior periods and recorded as revenue reciprocal compensation payments received 
table of contents reciprocal compensation decreased by million or to million from million in the main reason for the decrease was a decrease of million in amounts received as a result of the settlement of disputes related to prior withholdings of reciprocal compensation payments in  withholdings of reciprocal compensation payments in by verizon for the final five months and sbc for the final month based on federal rate caps  partially offset by an increase of in minutes of use subject to reciprocal compensation payments 
direct billings to sp customers increased during the year ended december  from the same period in by million  or  to million from million during the year ended december  while lines in service to this market increased to  lines at december  from  lines in service at december   an increase in lines of  or  revenue per line decreased in response to on going competitive pressure on pricing 
direct billings to sme business customers increased in the year ended december  from the same period in by million  or  to million from million during the same period in this increase was primarily due to introduction of new services for sme customers in combined with an increase in lines in service to  lines at the year ended december  from  lines in service at december   an increase of  or  partially offset by lower rates offered to our new and renewing customers in in response to increased market pricing pressures 
outbound local and long distance revenues  including   and numbers and travel card calls  decreased during the year ended december  by million or to million from million during the year ended december  the decline in revenue from to was principally due to the highly competitive nature of this market 
the million  or  decrease in dedicated transport revenues to million during the year ended december  from million during the same period in primarily relates to reduced service levels 
switched access revenues decreased in the year ended december  from the same period in by million  or  to million from million in the year ended december  this decrease was mainly due to payments received in that were previously withheld 
our significant costs and expenses for the years ended december  are as follows costs and expenses in millions change network expenses selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses our consolidated network expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the corresponding period in the decrease in expense is primarily the result of negotiated supplier credits recorded and improved network utilization in the year ended december   and decisions made in to discontinue certain low margin products and services  specifically products and services related to coam equipment and dsl 
although we continue to look for ways to optimize our network  we cannot guarantee that our network expenses will continue to decline in the future as we experience growth in network operations associated with a higher level of telecommunications activity 
our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the same period in 
table of contents the decrease is primarily the result of decreases in bad debt expense of million  resulting from improved quality in our customer base and collection activities 
the reserve for bad debts requires management s judgment and is based on customer specific indicators  as well as historical trending  industry norms and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions 
reserve for bad debt was million and million at december  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses were and of revenues for the year ended december  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in mainly due to the decrease in revenues as discussed above 
estimates and assumptions are used in setting depreciable lives 
assumptions are based on internal studies of use  industry data on average asset lives  recognition of technological advancements and understanding of business strategy 
our consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased million to million  from million for the same period in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the change in estimated useful lives of certain assets  which we made in january  and a higher fixed asset depreciable base in this change reduced the useful life for phone equipment provided to customers and computer hardware from years to years and extended the useful life of some leasehold improvements from years to up to years 
these changes were made to more closely match our accounting treatment to the expected lives of these assets 
as a result of the change  we incurred a charge in which increased depreciation expense for the year ended december  by million 
restructuring charges were million for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  a summary of the restructuring expenses and the associated remaining liability which is included in other accrued liabilities in the our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and consist of the following in thousands remaining balance of restructuring additional restructuring liability as restructuring liability as of dec

 expense non cash cash of dec 
 incurred charges payments leasehold improvements and equipment rent expense for vacated premises circuit obligations other charges we did not approve a new restructuring plan in during  we recorded additional restructuring charges of million relating to office space in san diego  california 
due to the specialized nature of this facility and current economic conditions we no longer anticipate finding a 
table of contents tenant for the remaining available space 
the amount of the reserve recorded is equal to the monthly lease payment of the unoccupied space multiplied by the remaining months on the lease 
in addition  during  we reversed million of previously recorded restructuring charges relating to professional fees that were anticipated but not incurred 
the final cash payment to be recorded against the restructuring reserve is currently expected to occur in march of loss from operations for the year ended december  was million compared to a loss from operations of million for the year ended december  in addition to the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs no asset impairment charges were recorded in year ended december  compared to asset impairment charges of million in year ended december  our consolidated interest expense  net for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the same period ended interest expense is net of interest income 
interest expense over these two periods is primarily related to our senior notes issued on january   including amortization of related deferred financing costs associated with the offering over a period of ten years 
the decrease in interest expense  net during was primarily due to reduced interest expense of million consistent with lower average debt outstanding  due to the repurchase of approximately million principal amount of senior notes during  offset by reduced interest income of million 
our effective income tax rates for the years ended december  and reflect the applicable federal and state statutory income tax rates 
for the years ended december  and  our effective income tax rate was and  respectively 
net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to net income of million in the year ended december  this was principally due the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs  and a gain on the repurchase of bonds of million in the year ended december  compared to a gain on the repurchase of bonds of million in the year ended december   year ended december  compared to year ended december  the significant revenue components and operational metrics for the years ended december  are as follows in millions except lines and minutes of use revenues in millions change reciprocal compensation direct billings to sp customers direct billings to sme customers outbound local and long distance dedicated transport switched access coam other total revenues operational metrics ds equivalent lines in service minutes of use in billions consolidated revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues is 
table of contents primarily the result of an increase of million in reciprocal compensation payments  which includes million of previously withheld reciprocal compensation billings in negotiated settlements during in addition  there was an increase of million in recurring charges and installation charges billed directly to sp and sme business customers and an increase of million in switched access revenues resulting from increased line growth and usage 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in product and service revenues related to exiting the coam business  a decrease of million in local and long distance usage revenues and a decrease of million in dedicated transport services due primarily to declining market rates during  we also experienced a decrease of approximately in the reciprocal compensation rate at which we are compensated at by the ilecs 
the total lines in service increased to  as of december  from  lines as of december  billable minutes of use were billion for the year ended december   up from billion billed minutes during the company has also segregated sme lines into on network and off network components as related to the company s decision to exit a number of off network lines of business in the number of inbound local minutes subject to reciprocal compensation revenues in accordance with interconnection agreements were billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively  while the year over year increase of billion billable minutes of use from to represented a increase 
however  the favorable increase in inbound local minutes was offset by the decline in the reciprocal compensation rate over the course of the year 
net of the effect of the previously withheld reciprocal compensation payments of million during the year ended december   reciprocal compensation revenues decreased million from to million compared to million for the year ended december  total reciprocal compensation revenue  inclusive of settlement amounts  for the year ended december  was million 
direct billings to sp customers increased during the year ended december  from the same period in by million  or to million from million during the year ended december  this change was due to the increase in lines in service to this market from  lines at december  to  lines in service at december  the revenue effect of the increase in lines in service was partially offset by the drop in dsl revenue when the company exited the dsl market during the second quarter of direct billings to sme business customers increased during the year ended december  from the same period in by million  or to million from million during the year ended december  this change was due to the increase in lines in service from  lines at december  to  lines in service at december  the revenue effect of the increase in lines in service was partially offset by a drop in the residential resale revenue when the company exited the residential market during the second quarter of outbound local and long distance revenues  including   and numbers and travel card calls  decreased during the year ended december  from the same period in by million or to million from million during the year ended december  although total minutes billed to customers increased between periods  the average rate per minute charged to customers declined in part to a change in the mix between local and long distance calls made by customers changed during these periods 
during the year ended december   approximately of minutes billed to customers were charges for local minutes compared to approximately in the same period ended the revenue effect was also impacted when the company made business decisions to exit certain lines of business such as residential  certain numbers and the suspension of service in states outside the company s network footprint 

table of contents the million  or  decrease in dedicated transport revenues to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  primarily relates to decreases in the number of sp customers who collocate at our superpops 
as a result of comprehensive product reviews intended to identify opportunities to improve profitability undertaken in connection with the development of the restructuring plan  we decided to exit certain low margin businesses in such as coam equipment  residential resale and dsl and concentrate efforts in developing next generation offerings 
this decision contributed to decreased revenues from product and service offerings of million  or  for the year ended compared to the same period ended the significant costs and expenses of the company for the years ended december  are as follows change network expenses selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses our consolidated network expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or to million from million for the year ended december  although we continue to experience an increase in network operations associated with a higher level of minutes of use passing through our network  our network expenses declined from the prior year as a result of discontinuing certain low margin products and services  our business decision to shut down certain of our switch locations during and improve capital utilization 
our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  in first two quarters of we incurred significant selling and marketing costs in connection with our anticipated efforts to expand our operations and establish ourselves in new markets before the decision was made to implement the restructuring plan  which provided for  among other things  a workforce reduction 
our headcount remained fairly stable throughout with employees as of december  compared to employees at december  during the fourth quarter of we completed a work force reduction of approximately employees as part of our restructuring plan 
as anticipated  the workforce reduction resulted in payroll savings of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  also include approximately million of provision for doubtful accounts compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the reserve for bad debts requires management s judgment and is based on customer specific indicators  as well as historical trending  industry norms and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions 
during we experienced an unusually high level of delinquencies and bankruptcies in our customer base 
this was primarily due to our mix of customers  which included among others residential  paging and coam 
we exited these product lines during and early due in part to the high level of delinquencies experienced in on these product lines 
in addition  our sp customer base contracted as the smaller  less financially stable customers were forced to restructure  or failed to survive 
our overall sp lines in service and sp revenues were not directly affected by this contraction as our larger sp customers absorbed many of the smaller sp customers end user base 
partially offsetting these costs savings  however  were additional legal expenses incurred in connection with efforts to defend our position on various reciprocal compensation proceedings and additional maintenance and property tax expense incurred on purchases of equipment between the years 
selling  general and administrative expenses were and of revenues for the years ended december  and respectively

among other initiatives  the restructuring plan provided for the closure of our switch facility in colorado 
in connection with this closing  we recorded a million restructuring charge in the second quarter of of this amount  million related to the write off of the net book value of leasehold improvements and equipment which could not be redeployed to other locations and  in management s 
table of contents best estimate  had a fair market value of zero  million related to circuit commitment obligations  and million related to future rent payments due for the abandoned premise in colorado which will be paid over the lease term  which ends in fiscal year in order to estimate rent expense related to this premise  and those premises discussed in the following paragraph  the company made certain assumptions including  the time period over which the premises would remain vacant  sublease terms  and estimated sublease rents 
in the case of the colorado switching facility and the utah switching facility described in the following paragraph  no sublease income was estimated due to the specialized nature of these facilities and current economic conditions 
accordingly  the company believed the net book value of the leasehold improvements for the facilities had a fair market value of zero 
in the third quarter of  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of  net representing the net difference between the amount estimated and the actual net book value of impaired leasehold improvements 
in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our restructuring accrual for future rent payments for the colorado switch facility by million as we had to use the facility longer than anticipated due to a delay in transferring one of our customers to another carrier 
this lease expires in march in the fourth quarter of  we negotiated and paid an early termination penalty to satisfy all future rent payments due for our switch facility in utah 
accordingly  we reversed previous charges of million to bring the accrual for this facility to zero 
in august  in response to a weakening economy and increasing competitive pressure resulting from lower than expected demand for telecommunications services and overcapacity in our industry  we shifted our strategy to margin improvement  cost containment and cash conservation rather than top line growth we approved and announced a restructuring plan 
among the initiatives included in the restructuring plan was the suspension of our expansion plans in certain states  exiting of certain lower margin products and services  including residential resale and customer owned and maintained coam equipment  and undertaking certain cost reduction initiatives 
in addition to restructuring certain product offerings  the restructuring initiatives included closing the switch facility in utah  consolidation of six sales offices  and a workforce reduction of approximately employees 
as a result of these restructuring initiatives  we recorded an million restructuring charge in the third quarter of  of which million was related to the write off of leasehold improvements and other equipment in utah  which could not be redeployed to other locations 
amounts expensed totaling million relate to future rent payments due net of estimated sublease payments for abandoned premises  primarily in utah and san diego  to be paid over the respective lease terms 
the workforce reduction was completed during the fourth quarter  with all severance payments being made as of december  our consolidated interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million to million from million for the year ended december  interest expense is net of capitalized interest 
interest expense over these two years is primarily related to the million senior notes issued on january   including amortization of related deferred financing costs associated with the offering over a period of ten years 
as a result of purchasing from holders of our senior notes an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of senior notes during  interest expense on our senior notes declined between the years 
however  these interest savings were partially offset by a reduction of capitalized interest of million and million for the twelve months ended december  and respectively 
loss from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  in addition to the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs we recorded asset impairment charges of million in the year ended december  compared to asset impairment charges of million in year ended december

some of the main reasons for the decline in net cash provided by operating activities in from were as follows withholdings of reciprocal compensation payments by verizon for the final five months and sbc for the final month of based on their interpretation of growth rate caps  
table of contents a decrease of million in amounts received as a result of the settlement of disputes related to reciprocal compensation payments withheld from prior periods  and a loss on redemption of debt of million in compared to a gain in of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to a net cash used in investing activities of million for the same period ended in during the year ended december  we sold million of short term investments  to help fund the repurchase of the senior notes  as compared to million of purchases of short term investments during the year ended december  purchases of property and equipment decreased to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the same period in as we were able to re deploy existing or under utilized equipment rather than purchase new equipment to meet our operating needs 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period ended this was mainly due to cash used to repurchase our senior notes of million in and million in  partially offset by million of cash provided by the issuance of senior secured notes in december cash requirements 
the telecommunications service business is capital intensive 
our operations have required substantial capital investment for the design  acquisition  construction and implementation of our network 
with the recent advancements in switch technology  we are currently investigating our options for the deployment of our first next generation network switch  which represents the latest technological improvements in switch capacity and configuration  sometime during in addition we completed a modem replacement program in the first quarter of which we expect will provide us with increased operational efficiencies 
we continue to seek further ways to enhance our infrastructure in and beyond 
these projects and our business plan  as currently contemplated  anticipates capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of approximately million for however  the actual cost of capital expenditures during will depend on a variety of factors 
accordingly  our actual capital requirements may exceed  or fall below  the amounts described above 
during the normal course of business  we may enter into agreements with some suppliers  which allow these suppliers to have equipment or inventory available for purchase based upon criteria as defined by us 
as of december   we did not have any material future purchase commitments to purchase equipment from any of our vendors 
debt outstanding 
at december  long term debt and capital lease obligations consist of the following in thousands senior notes senior secured note capital lease obligation notes payable less current portion of capital lease the senior secured note in the principal amount of million carries an interest rate of libor plus at december   and matures in december the maturity date of the senior secured note will be automatically extended to coincide with any extension of the expiration date of the warrants  which is extendable for up to an additional months at the option of deutsche bank 
under the terms of the guaranty and security agreement related to the senior secured note  we granted deutsche bank a security interest in substantially all of our assets and agreed to certain 
table of contents covenants including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  sell assets and pay dividends 
the senior notes in the principal amount of approximately million bear interest at per annum payable in semiannual installments  with all principal due in full on february  in conjunction with the december tender offer for senior notes we also solicited consents to effect certain proposed amendments to the indenture governing the senior notes 
these amendments to the indenture governing the senior notes  which are now effective  eliminated most of the indenture s principal restrictive covenants and amended certain other provisions contained in the indenture 
in addition  we are currently considering various alternatives to replace our senior credit facility which expired in however  there can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining additional capital sources at rates and terms acceptable to us 
future uses and sources of cash 
our principal sources of funds for are anticipated to be current cash and short term investment balances and cash flows from operating activities 
we may also obtain lease or additional lines of credit in there can be no assurance that additional lines of credit or leases will be entered into at interest rates that are acceptable 
we believe that these funds will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources for us to fund our business plan for the next months 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
we discuss our material contractual obligations under contractual obligations below 
as currently contemplated  we expect to fund  among other things interest payments of approximately million assuming an interest rate of on our senior secured note and our expected election to defer quarterly interest payments  anticipated capital expenditures of approximately million  and capital lease payments including interest of approximately million 
the foregoing statements do not take into account i acquisitions  which  if made  are expected to be funded through a combination of cash and equity ii the repurchase of any of our remaining outstanding senior notes or iii any potential payments made in respect of adjustments which may arise from our ongoing tax audits 
depending upon our rate of growth and profitability  among other things  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements or capital needs 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required  or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to us 
key factors which could affect our liquidity include future demand of our services  financial stability of our customers  outcomes of regulatory proceedings involving reciprocal compensation  capital expenditures  our debt payments  capital lease repayments  and interest expense on debt 
the guaranty and security agreement related to the senior secured note contains various covenants  which among other things restrict our ability to borrow future amounts  early repay future borrowings and restrict our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock 
our senior notes indenture contained financial and other covenants and events of default 
however in connection with the cash tender offer and consent solicitation we obtained the consent of the majority of our holders of our senior notes to amend certain provisions of the indenture governing such senior notes 
the amendments eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default and 
table of contents related provisions contained in the indenture 
we received the consent of noteholders holding a majority of the outstanding principal amount of senior notes  and entered into a supplemental incorporating the amendments 
contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations at december  are as follows in thousands less than over one year years years years total operating leases senior secured note see note below senior notes capital leases notes payable total the senior secured note matures in december and has been included in due from years 
this note can be extended for months at the option of deutsche bank 
the carrying value of the note included in liabilities in our balance sheet was approximately million at december  as further described in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december    and  we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we were engaged in such relationships 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our business over the past three years 
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each revenue recognition  provision for doubtful accounts receivable  estimated settlement of disputed billings  and impairment of long lived assets 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
thus  actual results could differ from estimates made and these differences could be material 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when there is pervasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the product or performance of the service has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determined  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
non refundable up front payments received for installation services and related costs up to the amount of installation revenues  are recognized as revenue and expense ratably over the term of the service contracts  generally to months 
any costs in excess of recognized revenues are expensed in the current period 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  of installation payments received were deferred and are included in deferred revenues  and million and million  respectively  of associated costs were deferred and are included in other assets  respectively  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we recognize revenues from the sale of telecommunications products upon installation  or if no installation is required  upon shipment  which is concurrent with the transfer of legal title 
revenues from service access agreements are recognized as the service is provided  except for reciprocal compensation generated by calls placed to isps connected through our network 
our right to receive this type of compensation is the subject of numerous regulatory and legal challenges 
until this issue is ultimately resolved  we will continue to recognize reciprocal compensation as revenue when the price becomes fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
some ilecs with which we have interconnection agreements had withheld payments from amounts billed by us under their agreements 
the process of collection of reciprocal compensation can be complex and subject to interpretation of regulations and laws 
this can lead to the requirement for negotiated settlements between us and the ilec where we agree to accept a portion of what we believe is owed to us 
these settlements generally reflect the mutual agreements of both parties that exist at the date of the settlement 
settlements were entered into with ilecs whereby the ilecs paid us an aggregate of million in and million in the settlements were included in revenues 
provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
provisions for allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are estimated based upon historical collection experience  customer delinquencies and bankruptcies  information provided by our customers  observance of trends in the industry  and other current economic conditions 
at december  our provision for doubtful accounts receivable was million  which represented approximately of accounts receivable 
if an additional of our gross accounts receivable were deemed to be uncollectible at december   our provision for doubtful accounts and provision for bad debt expense would increase by approximately million 
if this information does not properly reflect future collections  our accounts receivable balance could be subject to change 
accruals for disputed billings 
during the ordinary course of business  we may be billed for carrier traffic that management believes we are not responsible for 
accordingly  we will dispute with the appropriate vendor and withhold payment until the matter is resolved 
our current disputes are primarily related to incorrect facility rates or incorrect billing elements we believe we are being charged 
management regularly reviews and monitors all disputed items and  based on industry experience  records an accrual that represents what we estimate that we owe on the disputed billings 
although we 
table of contents continue to actively try and expedite resolutions  often times the state public utilities commission must become involved to arbitrate such agreements 
this process is often not timely and resolutions often subject to appeal 
as of december   the company has accrued approximately million  representing approximately of the gross amount of disputes in negotiation at this time 
if resolutions to items in negotiation are favorable or unfavorable to management s estimations  our reserve for disputed items may be subject to change 
long lived assets 
in  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the potential future income expected to be generated by the asset 
if we consider an asset to be impaired  it is written down to its estimated fair market value 
this is assessed based on factors specific to the type of asset 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must make assumptions regarding  among other things  estimated future cash flows to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the sec s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
we are not exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments nor do we hold securities for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we had an outstanding million principal amount of senior secured notes payable 
these notes are at a rate of libor plus  which was at december  a hypothetical point increase in short term interest rates would reduce the annualized income before tax by approximately million as a result of higher interest expense 
additionally  we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our investments in cash equivalents and short term investments 
substantially all of our investments are in cash equivalents with original maturities of less than three months 
currently this reduces our exposure to long term interest rate changes 
a hypothetical decrease in short term interest rates would reduce the annualized pretax interest income on our million cash and cash equivalents at december  by approximately million
