item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company catellus development corporation is a publicly traded real estate development company that began operating as a reit effective january  we operated as a c corporation through december  we focus on managing  acquiring  and developing predominantly industrial rental property in many of the country s major distribution centers and transportation corridors 
catellus principal objective is sustainable  long term growth in earnings  which we seek to achieve by applying our strategic resources a lower risk higher return rental portfolio  a focus on expanding that portfolio through development  and the deployment of our proven land development skills to select opportunities where we can generate profits to recycle back into our core industrial business 
catellus was originally formed in to conduct the non railroad real estate activities of the santa fe pacific corporation and was spun off to stockholders effective in our railroad heritage gave us a diverse base of developable properties located near transportation corridors in major western united states markets 
this land has proven suitable for the development of a variety of product types  including industrial  retail  office  and residential 
over time  we have expanded our business by acquiring land suitable for primarily industrial development in many of the same suburban locations where we have an established presence 
our rental portfolio provides a relatively consistent source of earnings and our development activities provide cash flow through sales of land or the conversion of our developable land to property that is either added 
index to financial statements to our portfolio or sold to tenants  developers  investors or other interested parties 
we invest in new land to ensure our potential for growth 
as of december   we owned million square feet of commercial rental properties  of which approximately is industrial space 
our industrial rental portfolio is geographically diverse  located in major transportation corridors and distribution centers such as southern california  chicago  dallas  with plans to expand to atlanta and new jersey 
the majority of our rental portfolio is of newer construction and leased to diverse  high quality tenants through long term leases with staggered lease expirations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of real estate assets  capitalization of costs  including job costing  allowances for doubtful accounts  environmental and legal reserves  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue and profit recognition our revenue is primarily derived from two sources rental revenue from our rental portfolio and property sales 
rental revenue is recognized when due from tenants 
revenue from leases with rent concessions or fixed escalations is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial term of the related lease 
the financial terms of leases are contractually defined 
rental revenue is not accrued when a tenant vacates the premises and ceases to make rent payments or files for bankruptcy 
revenue from sales of properties is recognized using the accrual method 
if a sale does not qualify for the accrual method of recognition  other deferral methods are used as appropriate including the percentage of completion method 
in certain instances  when we receive an inadequate cash down payment and take a promissory note for the balance of the sale price  the sale is deferred until such time as sufficient cash is received to meet minimum down payment requirements 
also  in general  specific identification and relative sales value methods are used to determine the cost of sales 
a change in circumstances that causes the estimate of future costs  such as carrying costs  and construction costs  to increase or decrease significantly would affect the gain or loss recognized on future sales 
impairment of real estate assets we assess the impairment of a real estate asset when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value may not be recoverable 
indicators we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant negative industry or economic trend  a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  
index to financial statements a significant change in the manner in which an asset is used  and an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to construct an asset 
real estate is stated at cost using the methodology described as follows a for operating properties and properties held for development a write down to estimated fair value is recognized when a property s estimated undiscounted future cash flow is less than its net book value  and b for properties held for sale  a write down to estimated fair value is recorded when we determine that the net book value exceeds the estimated selling price  less cost to sell 
these evaluations are made on a property by property basis 
when we determine that the net book value of an asset may not be recoverable based upon the estimated undiscounted cash flow  we measure any impairment write down based on projected and probability weighted discounted cash flow method using an estimated market discount rate 
when performing impairment review  we consider capitalized interest and other expenses as costs of development in costs projections  value from comparable property sales will also be considered 
the evaluation of future cash flows  discount rates  and fair value of individual properties requires significant judgment and assumptions  including estimates of market value  lease terms  development absorption  development costs  lease up costs  and financings 
significant adverse changes in circumstances affecting these judgments and assumptions in future periods could cause a significant impairment adjustment to be recorded 
capitalization of costs we capitalize direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  property taxes  insurance  and certain indirect project costs  including a portion of our general and administrative costs that are associated with the acquisition  development  or construction of a project 
interest is capitalized in accordance with fas costs previously capitalized related to any abandoned sales or acquisitions opportunities are written off 
should development activity decrease  a portion of interest  property taxes  insurance  and certain general and administrative costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates with respect to the collectability of our receivables and provide for doubtful accounts based on several factors  including our estimate of collectability and the age of the outstanding balances 
our estimate of collectability is based on our contacts with the debtors  collection agencies  our knowledge of the debtors credit and financial condition  debtors payment terms  and current economic trends 
if a debtor becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy  we provide an allowance for the entire outstanding amount of the debtors receivable 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our allowances for any period if adverse general economic conditions cause widespread financial difficulties among our tenants 
environmental and legal reserves we incur ongoing environmental remediation costs  including cleanup costs  consulting fees for environmental studies and investigations  monitoring costs  and legal costs relating to cleanup  litigation defense  and the pursuit of responsible third parties 
we maintain a reserve for estimated costs of environmental remediation to be incurred in connection with operating properties and properties previously sold  these reserves  when established  are expensed 
costs relating to undeveloped land are capitalized as part of development costs  and costs incurred for properties to be sold are deferred and charged to cost of sales when the properties are sold  these costs are anticipated to be incurred over a period of twenty years 
our estimates are developed based on reviews that took place over many years based upon then prevailing law and identified site conditions 
because of the breadth of our portfolio  and past sales  we are unable to review each property extensively on a regular basis 
such estimates are not precise and are always subject to the availability of further information about the prevailing conditions at the site  the future requirements of regulatory agencies  and the availability and ability of 
index to financial statements other parties to pay some or all of such costs 
should a previously undetected  substantial environmental hazard be found on our properties  significant liquidity could be consumed by the resulting cleanup requirements  and a material expense may be recorded 
we are a party to a number of legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we cannot predict with certainty the final outcome of the proceedings 
where appropriate  we have established reserves for potential liabilities related to legal actions or threatened legal actions 
environmental and legal reserves are established based on estimates and probabilities of the occurrence of events and therefore are subject to revision from time to time 
should the circumstances affecting these estimates change significantly  a material expense would be recognized 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
where we have taken a deduction for a non routine transaction in which the tax impact is uncertain  no financial statement benefit is taken until the impact is certain 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  our inability to qualify as a reit  the potential for built in gain recognition  changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable reit subsidiaries trs  and changes in tax laws 
adjustments required in any given period are included within the tax provision in the statement of operations and or balance sheet 
any applicable interest charges associated with an audit settlement would be recorded as interest expense 
these adjustments could materially impact our statement of operations and liquidity 
business segment descriptions our reportable segments are based on our method of internal reporting  which disaggregates our business between long term operations and those which we intend to transition out of over the next several years and before the adjustments for discontinued operations 
we have two reportable segments core segment and urban  residential and other segment uro 
core segment includes the management and leasing of our rental portfolio  commercial development activities  which focuses on acquiring and developing suburban commercial business parks for our own rental portfolio and selling land and or buildings that we have developed to users and other parties  and select land development opportunities where we can utilize our land development skills with minimal capital investment 
uro includes the remaining residential projects  urban development activities and desert land sales  and assets we intend to transition out of over time and reit transition costs 
funds from operations in conjunction with the reit conversion  we will provide funds from operations ffo as a supplemental measure of performance calculated in accordance with the definition adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring  sales or write down of certain assets  cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  plus depreciation and amortization excluding depreciation on personal property and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities 
adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis 
our management generally believes that ffo  as defined by nareit  is a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market 
index to financial statements conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
we generally consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
ffo does include gains on sales of land and build to suit development projects 
in presenting our ffo prior to operating as a reit which was effective january   we included hypothetical tax savings that would have occurred had we been a reit during the periods presented 
we believe that presenting ffo as adjusted for hypothetical tax savings provides investors and analysts with a useful comparison of the hypothetical tax impacts of a reit structure 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of equity reits  other equity reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo or interpret the nareit definition differently and  accordingly  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to ffo as used by us 
ffo is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
further  ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity 
we believe that ffo provides relevant information about our operations and is useful  along with net income  for an understanding of our operating activities

management  development and other fees in our core segment increased million in primarily because of the recognition of certain deferred construction management fees related to a construction management contract with a ground lease lessee

real estate investment trust reit transition costs on march   we announced that our board of directors had authorized us to restructure our business operations in order to qualify as a reit  effective january  we have incurred conversion and related restructuring costs payable to third parties 
reit transition costs are in our uro segment because of its non recurring nature 
we had incurred reit transition costs of million in we expect to incur approximately million additional cost during  totaling approximately million of reit transaction costs through  primarily for consulting  legal  and tax services 
other other expenses consist primarily of expenses related to previously capitalized costs and other miscellaneous expenses 
other expenses in our core segment increased million in but decreased million in the increase in our core segment in was primarily because of an increase in equipment reserve in the decrease in our core segment was primarily because in we expensed certain predevelopment costs previously capitalized 
other expenses in our uro segment decreased million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily because of consulting fees of million  a million of cost overruns on a fixed price construction contract incurred in  and a reduction in legal reserve of million 
minority interests in  we formed a subsidiary for financing purposes and sold of this subsidiary s stock to minority investors 
this subsidiary was consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
in january  the subsidiary acquired the interest of the minority investors and  accordingly  became a wholly owned subsidiary 
income taxes in december  we restructured our business operations to enable us to qualify as a reit effective january  in general  a corporation that elects reit status and distributes at least of its taxable income to its shareholders and complies with certain other requirements relating primarily to the nature of its assets and the sources of its revenues is not subject to federal income taxation to the extent it distributes its 
index to financial statements taxable income 
we believe that we will operate so as to qualify as a reit beginning january   including paying at least of our reit taxable income to shareholders in and subsequent years 
based on these considerations  we believe that we will not be liable for taxes except with respect to the items discussed below and have reversed approximately million of previously established net tax liabilities due to temporary differences between book and tax amounts in the fourth quarter of as part of restructuring our operations to enable us to qualify as a reit  we have created subsidiaries subject to certain size limitations that qualify as trs and will be subject to federal and state income taxes 
accordingly  we will still be liable for federal and state taxes with respect to income earned in the trs 
as a result of this future tax liability  certain assets of the trs carry temporary differences between book and tax amounts that will continue to be reflected as net deferred tax liabilities at the trs and in the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  our and later federal and state tax returns are still open with certain returns currently under audit  which may result in additional taxes with respect to these prior years 
also  at december   a majority of our assets outside of the trs have values in excess of tax basis built in gain of approximately billion 
under the reit rules  we are liable for the tax on this built in gain if it is realized in a taxable transaction as for example by sale of the asset within ten years 
we believe that we will pay taxes on built in gains on certain of our assets in the event we cannot effectuate a tax free exchange 
lastly  we expect that once certain tasks are completed  certain of our assets not currently in the trs will later be contributed to the trs and carry temporary differences between book and tax amounts 
the provision for income taxes consists of year ended december  difference difference income before income taxes income taxes current taxes deferred taxes income tax benefit expense total tax current tax rate deferred tax rate tax rate our tax rate improved from in to in due primarily to adjustments associated with the reit conversion as discussed above 
without the reversal due to the reit conversion in the fourth quarter of discussed above  the tax rate would have been 
our tax rate declined in over because of charitable deductions taken  which in the tax return are recorded for tax at fair market value which was in excess of book value 
the calculation of taxes due involves the use of many estimates that are not finalized and adjusted until our tax returns are filed  usually in september of the following year 
consequently  actual taxes paid in regard to any given year will differ from the amounts shown above  however  the differences have historically not been material and are not expected to be material in the future 
variability in results although our rental properties provide relatively stable operating results  our earnings from period to period will be affected by the nature and timing of acquisitions and sales of property 
also  sales of assets are difficult to predict given fluctuating economic conditions and are generally subject to lengthy negotiations and contingencies that need to be resolved before closing 
these factors may tend to bunch income in particular periods rather than producing a more even pattern throughout the year or from year to year 
in addition  gross margins may vary 
index to financial statements significantly as the mix of property varies 
the cost basis of the properties sold varies because i properties have been owned for varying periods of time  ii properties are owned in various geographical locations  and iii development projects have varying infrastructure costs and build out periods 
liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and commitments we have the following off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and commitments  which are discussed in various sections of the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements  and elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these arrangements exist in the following areas unconsolidated real estate joint ventures capital contribution requirements debt and debt service guarantees surety bonds  standby letters of credit and commitments executed contracts for construction and development activity generally any funding of off balance sheet guarantees would result in the increase of our ownership interest in a project or entity  similar to the treatment of a unilateral additional capital contribution to an investee 
unconsolidated real estate joint ventures capital contribution requirements we have investments in thirteen unconsolidated real estate joint ventures  of which  seven joint ventures are in our core segment and the other six joint ventures are in our uro segment 
four of the joint ventures are involved in the operation of rental real estate properties and the remaining nine are involved in real estate development for investment or sale 
we use the equity method of accounting for twelve of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and the cost method of accounting for one unconsolidated joint venture 
we are required to make additional capital contributions beyond an initial commitment of million to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures should additional capital contributions be necessary to fund excess costs 
the joint venture requires capital contributions if actual development costs exceed the approved project development budget 
the development budget is approximately million and will be funded as follows million from a construction loan  which closed in september  million from our partners  and the remaining million from us 
as of december   we had contributed million of our million commitment  and we do not expect to fund any significant amounts in excess of the million 
we are also required to make additional capital contributions to two other unconsolidated joint ventures should additional capital contributions be necessary to fund excess costs 
based upon the joint venture agreements  we are required to fund up to a maximum contribution of million  of which we have cumulatively contributed million 
as of december   we do not expect to fund any additional capital contributions beyond our maximum capital requirements 
we agreed with another unconsolidated joint venture to make additional contributions should there be insufficient funds to meet its current or projected financial requirements 
as of december   we have cumulatively contributed million to this unconsolidated joint venture  and we do not expect to fund any additional contributions beyond this amount 
additional contributions made to our development joint ventures would be reflected as investment in development joint ventures see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

index to financial statements unconsolidated real estate joint ventures debt and debt service guarantees we have made certain debt service guarantees for two of our unconsolidated uro segment development joint ventures 
at december   based on the joint ventures outstanding debt balance  these debt service guarantees totaled million 
these debt service guarantees are typical business arrangements commonly required in real estate development 
examples of events that would require us to provide a cash payment pursuant to a guarantee include a loan default  which would result from failure of the primary borrower to service the debt when due  or non compliance of the primary borrower with financial covenants and inadequacy of asset collateral 
our guarantee exposure is generally limited to situations in which the value of the collateral is not sufficient to satisfy the outstanding indebtedness 
at december   we have not been required to satisfy any amounts pursuant to these debt and debt service guarantees 
surety bonds  standby letters of credit and commitments as of december   we have million in surety bonds  outstanding standby letters of credit in favor of local municipalities or financial institutions  commitments to guarantee leases  and the construction of real property improvements or financial obligations 
surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies in real estate development 
surety bonds and commitments are to guarantee the construction of public improvements and infrastructure such as sewer  streets  traffic signals  grading  and wildlife preservations  in connection with our various development projects 
the surety bonds and standby letters of credit are renewable and expire upon completion of the required improvements 
standby letters of credit are a form of credit enhancement commonly required in real estate development when bonds are issued to finance public improvements 
executed contracts for construction and development activity at december   we have open construction and development contracts with vendors totaling million related to our various projects  as compared to million at december  the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total due within due in due in due thereafter in thousands mortgage and other debt operating leases contracts total contractual obligations includes approximately million of mortgage notes associated with assets held for sale that is presented as liabilities associated with assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets 
a portion of these obligations is expected to be reimbursed by bond proceeds and various third parties

risks related to real estate investments we depend on tenants to generate lease revenues 
we are subject to the risk that  upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties  leases may not be renewed by existing tenants  the space may not be re leased to new tenants or the terms of renewal or re 
index to financial statements leasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than current lease terms 
a tenant may experience a down turn in its business which may cause the loss of the tenant or may weaken its financial condition  and result in the tenant s failure to make rental payments when due  result in a reduction in percentage rent receivable with respect to retail tenants or require a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease 
in addition  a tenant of any of our properties may seek the protection of bankruptcy  insolvency  or similar laws  which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 
although we have not experienced material losses from tenant bankruptcies  no assurance can be given that tenants will not file for bankruptcy or similar protection in the future or  if any tenants file  that they will affirm their leases or continue to make rental payments in a timely manner 
our real estate development strategies may not be successful 
any of our existing or future development activities will entail certain risks  including the expenditure of funds on and devotion of management s time to projects which may not come to fruition  the risk that development or redevelopment costs of a project may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project uneconomic  the risk that occupancy rates and rents at a completed project will be less than anticipated or that there will be vacant space at the project  the risk that expenses at a completed development will be higher than anticipated  and the risk that permits and other governmental approvals will not be obtained 
because of the discretionary nature of these approvals and concerns which may be raised by various governmental officials  public interest groups and other interested parties during both the approval and development process  our ability to develop properties and realize income from our projects could be delayed  reduced or eliminated 
in addition  our real estate development activities require significant capital expenditures 
we incur considerable infrastructure costs in connection with our commercial  urban  and residential projects 
we will be required to obtain funds for our capital expenditures and operating activities through cash flow from operations  property sales or financings 
there can be no assurances that funds available from cash flow  property sales and financings will be sufficient to fund our required or desired capital expenditures for development 
if we were unable to obtain sufficient funds  we might have to defer or otherwise limit certain development activities 
in addition  any new development or any rehabilitation of older projects can require compliance with new building codes and other regulations 
general economic conditions in the areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results 
we currently conduct the majority of our business in california 
consequently  we are exposed to changes in the real estate market or in general economic conditions in california 
any changes may result in higher vacancy rates for commercial property and lower prevailing rents  lower sales prices or slower sales  lower absorption rates  and more tenant defaults and bankruptcies  which would negatively impact our financial performance 
we have significant holdings in california  illinois  texas  colorado and arizona 
of our primary rental properties  which are comprised of commercial buildings  approximately  by square footage  are located in southern california  in northern california  in illinois  in texas  in colorado  in arizona  in ohio  with the remaining in four other states 
further  approximately of our total 
index to financial statements commercial developable land by square footage is located in california silicon valley  san francisco s east bay  los angeles county  orange county  and the inland empire san bernardino and riverside counties  approximately in illinois  approximately in texas  with the remaining in six other states 
all of our residential land for potential development based on number of lots is located in california  with approximately in northern california and in southern california 
to the extent that weak economic conditions or other factors affect these regions more severely than other areas of the country  our financial performance could be negatively impacted 
exposure of our assets to damage from natural occurrences such as earthquakes  and weather conditions that affect the progress of construction may impact financial results 
natural disasters  such as earthquakes  floods or fires  or unexpected climactic conditions  such as unusually heavy or prolonged rain  particularly in california  where our assets are concentrated  may have an adverse impact on our ability to develop our properties and realize income from our projects 
illiquidity of real estate and reinvestment risk may reduce economic returns to investors 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  our ability to vary our portfolio quickly in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited 
additionally  the internal revenue code places certain limits on the number of properties a reit may sell without adverse tax consequences 
further  certain significant expenditures  including property taxes  maintenance costs  mortgage payments  insurance costs and related charges must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property regardless of whether the real property is producing any income 
other risks affecting our business and operations our use of taxable reit subsidiaries is limited 
for tax years beginning after december   a reit is permitted to own one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
the introduction of taxable reit subsidiaries broadens the scope of activities in which a reit and its consolidated subsidiaries can engage without disqualifying the reit because income from a taxable reit subsidiary is not treated as impermissible income 
our use of taxable reit subsidiaries will enable us to engage in the development of land for sale to third parties 
however  under the internal revenue code  no more than of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
this limitation may affect our ability to add to our land inventory or to increase the size of our third party development operations 
our use of taxable reit subsidiaries may affect the price of catellus common stock relative to the stock price of other reits 
following our election to be taxed as a reit  we will hold a significant portion of our land assets  and conduct a substantial portion of our development activities  through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
taxable reit subsidiaries are corporations subject to corporate level tax 
prior to  the internal revenue code substantially limited a reit s ability to operate through corporate subsidiaries 
however  recent changes to the reit rules allow us to hold the land that we develop for sale to third parties  including urban and residential land  as well as residential and mixed use development joint ventures  in one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
this reit taxable reit subsidiary structure may cause the market to value our common stock differently than the stock of other publicly traded reits  which may not use taxable reit subsidiaries as extensively as we plan to following our election to be taxed as a reit 

index to financial statements we are dependent on external sources of capital and have substantial amounts of debt 
to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  we generally are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least of our net taxable income determined without regard to net capital gains and the dividends paid deduction 
we may be required to borrow funds on a short term basis or liquidate investments to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to qualify as a reit  even if management believes that it is not in our best interests to do so 
we may have to rely on third party sources of capital in order to repay our debt  fund capital expenditures  make acquisitions  and otherwise pursue our strategic objectives 
these external sources of capital may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our access to third party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors  including general market conditions  the market s perception of our growth potential and risk characteristics of our underlying business operations  our current and potential future earnings and cash flow and the market price of our securities 
moreover  additional equity offerings may result in the substantial dilution of our stockholders interests and additional debt financing may further leverage us 
in the event we are unable to access third party sources of capital on terms favorable to us  we may be delayed in implementing capital improvements or in pursuing our growth strategy which could reduce our revenue or operating income 
as of december   we had approximately billion of debt 
this amount of debt could have important consequences for our investors and for us  some of which include our ability to obtain additional financing may be impaired  both currently and in the future  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on this indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes  our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal  interest or future dividends  we may be substantially more leveraged than our competitors  putting us at a competitive disadvantage  and our flexibility to adjust to market conditions is limited  leaving us vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business 
our current indebtedness bears interest at both fixed and floating interest rates 
for future financings  we intend to seek the most attractive financing arrangements available at the time  which may involve either fixed or floating interest rates 
with respect to floating rate indebtedness  increases in interest rates may adversely affect our cash flow from operations  funds available for distribution  and ability to meet our debt service obligations 
competition in the real estate industry 
the real estate industry is generally fragmented and characterized by significant competition 
numerous developers  owners of industrial  office and retail properties and managers compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition  development and management opportunities  tenants  and purchasers for homes and for non strategic assets 
there are competitors  such as other reits  as well as private real estate companies and financial buyers in each area in which we operate  which have greater capital resources than we do 
these competitive disadvantages  the number of competitors and the number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on the rents we can charge  our ability to lease space in our existing properties or at newly acquired or developed properties and the prices we have to pay for developable land 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the existence of such competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operations and cash flow 
there is no limitation on debt in our organizational documents 
our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount or percentage of indebtedness we may incur 
accordingly  we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that 
index to financial statements could adversely affect our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders and in an increased risk of default on our obligations 
we may change our policies in ways that adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our investment and financing policies and our policies with respect to other activities  including our growth  debt capitalization  distributions  reit status and operating policies are determined by our board of directors 
our board of directors may change these policies at any time without a vote of our stockholders 
a change in these policies might adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on key personnel 
we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel 
while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
labor shortages and costs could impact our projects 
labor shortages and costs could significantly influence the success of projects 
possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in that real property 
these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
because we own or our corporate predecessors owned properties in urban and industrial areas  and have historically leased many of our properties to commercial and industrial tenants whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto such properties  we incur ongoing environmental remediation costs and are subject from time to time to environmental actions by governmental entities and private parties 
while we or outside consultants have evaluated the environmental liabilities associated with most of our properties  any evaluation is necessarily based upon then prevailing law  site conditions and the use of sampling methodologies 
the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly  may adversely affect the owner s or operator s ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral 
future environmental costs are difficult to estimate because of such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination  the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required  the determination of our potential liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties  and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from insurance 
at december   we estimate that future costs for remediation of environmental contamination on operating properties and properties previously sold approximate million  and have provided a reserve for that amount 
it is anticipated that such costs will be incurred over the next several years 
we also estimate approximately million of similar costs relating to our properties to be developed or sold 
catellus is currently under investigation by the department of toxics and substance control of the state of california concerning the mission bay project 
the investigation  which is ongoing  focuses on whether individuals and companies hauling soil within and from mission bay satisfied certain hazardous waste license certification hauling requirements 
catellus does not anticipate that this investigation or any proceeding that may result from this investigation will have a material adverse impact on the mission bay project

index to financial statements uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition 
we typically purchase commercial general liability  all risk property and rental loss insurance for our properties and development projects  with limits customarily carried for similar properties 
some types of losses  such as losses from earthquakes  terrorism  environmental hazards or toxic mold may be either uninsurable or too expensive to justify insuring against 
in renewing our policies over the last several years  we were able to essentially obtain all of our historical levels and types of insurance although at a higher cost and  in certain instances  with higher deductibles and or more restrictive conditions  except liability coverage for our residential business  which now has a higher deductible and a much lower policy limit and terrorism insurance  which was initially excluded from our property coverage placed on october  however  under the united states terrorism risk insurance act of  carriers are now required to offer us terrorism coverage and are allowed to charge an incremental premium for such coverage 
we have obtained coverage that matches the risk profile for our portfolio of properties  primarily consisting of distribution warehouse and suburban office and retail that we consider to be relatively low risk 
we have placed a stand alone terrorism policy for a single asset located near downtown san francisco and expect that we may place additional  similar stand alone policies if circumstances warrant 
there can be no assurance that significant losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur 
also  we and our predecessors have owned some of the properties in our portfolio for many years and acquired properties in a variety of ways  including by railroad land grants 
we have not obtained title insurance on all of the properties in our portfolio  and some properties may be subject to limitations on or challenges to our title 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs  catellus operating limited partnership could lose its capital invested in the property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property  while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the property 
an uninsured loss or loss in excess of insured limits may negatively impact our financial condition 
as the general partner of catellus operating limited partnership  catellus is generally liable for any of their unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations 
the costs of compliance with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business 
our facilities are subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as the americans with disabilities act and state and local fire and life safety requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants 
we believe that our facilities are currently in material compliance with such regulatory requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed  a result that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us and could have an adverse effect on our cash flow 
we face risks due to our investments through partnerships or joint ventures 
instead of purchasing properties directly  we have and may continue to invest as a co venturer 
joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets 
therefore  these investments may  under certain circumstances  involve risks such as the possibility that the co venturer in an investment might become bankrupt  or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or our policies or objectives 
consequently  actions by a co venturer might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk 
although we generally will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture to permit our objectives to be achieved  we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent 
additionally  should a joint venture partner become bankrupt  we could become liable for that partner s share of joint venture liabilities 

index to financial statements the supply and price of electrical power could affect our rental and sales activities 
shortages in and higher prices for electrical power could negatively affect our ability to rent or sell properties 
an ownership limit and certain anti takeover defenses could inhibit a change of control of our company or reduce the value of our stock 
the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of catellus and its amended and restated bylaws contain provisions which may have an anti takeover effect 
the following provisions of these governing documents could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  including certain acquisitions that stockholders may deem to be in their best interests the amended and restated bylaws do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  the amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains restrictions on the number of shares that may be owned by any stockholder  the amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits the issuance of one or more series of a new class of preferred stock with rights and preferences to be determined by the board of directors  the amended and restated certificate of incorporation restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders  and the amended and restated bylaws require advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations 
federal income tax risks relating to reit qualification if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit  we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our stockholders and our income will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates 
we began operating as a reit under the internal revenue code commencing january  as a reit  we generally will not pay corporate level tax on income we currently distribute to our stockholders as long as we distribute currently at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gain 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will so qualify or be able to remain so qualified or that new legislation  treasury regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit such as ours that holds its assets in partnership form 
further  the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
if in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit  we will suffer the following negative results we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income  and we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
in addition  we will be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost  unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions 

index to financial statements there are uncertainties relating to the estimate of our earnings and profits attributable to c corporation taxable years 
in order to qualify as a reit  we cannot have at the end of any reit taxable year any undistributed earnings and profits that are attributable to a c corporation taxable year 
a reit has until the close of its first full taxable year as a reit in which it has non reit earnings and profits to distribute these accumulated earnings and profits 
we will be required to distribute these earnings and profits prior to the end of our first taxable year as a reit  which we expect will be failure to do so would result in our disqualification as a reit 
the determination of such earnings and profits is complicated and depends upon facts with respect to which we may have less than complete information or the application of the law governing earnings and profits which is subject to differing interpretations  or both 
we currently believe and intend that the special e p distribution will exceed the amount required to be distributed in order to satisfy the requirement that we not have accumulated earnings and profits attributable to a c corporation taxable year by an amount to be determined by the board of directors 
consequently  we believe that the special e p distribution will be sufficient to distribute all of our non reit earnings and profits by the close of our first taxable year as a reit 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties relating to the estimate of our non reit earnings and profits and  thus  we cannot assure you that this requirement will be met 
these uncertainties include the possibility that the internal revenue service could upon audit increase the taxable income of catellus  which would increase the non reit earnings and profits of catellus 
in this regard  we received notice from the internal revenue service on march  of its intent to audit the income tax return of catellus 
the internal revenue service also advised us of its intent to audit the income tax return of a mortgage reit subsidiary of catellus 
these audits are now under way 
tax counsel will not provide any opinion as to the amount of catellus undistributed earnings and profits and will rely  for purposes of its opinion as to our qualification as a reit  upon a representation from us that we will not have any undistributed non reit earnings and profits as of the end of the year for which we first file our reit election 
thus  we cannot assure you that we will satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our non reit earnings and profits by the close of our first taxable year as a reit 
there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determination of our non reit earnings and profits  and there are uncertainties regarding the amount of such earnings and profits 
our third party development business is potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax 
we currently conduct third party land sales as part of our third party development business 
as a reit  we will be subject to a tax on our net income from prohibited transactions 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of business 
sales by us of property in the course of our third party development business will generally constitute prohibited transactions 
we intend to avoid the prohibited transactions tax by conducting our third party land sales through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
we may not  however  always be able to identify properties that will become part of our third party development business at the time we acquire such properties 
additionally  properties we initially acquire and hold for investment purposes may become third party development properties as circumstances change 
therefore  we face the potential of being subject to the prohibited transactions tax on the sale of properties acquired by us and not through a taxable reit subsidiary which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary case of business or which subsequently becomes property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
there are potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities 
we will be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate currently on any gain recognized from a sale of any assets occurring within ten years of the reit conversion which we hold at the effective time of our election to be a reit but only to the extent of the built in gain based on the fair 
index to financial statements market value of those assets on the effective date of the reit election 
effective january   such tax will be based on the fair market value of our assets as of january  gain from a sale of an asset occurring more than years after the reit conversion will not be subject to this corporate level tax 
we currently do not expect to sell any asset if such a sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability 
we cannot  however  assure you that we will not change our plans in this regard 
we intend to conduct a substantial portion of our development business  consisting of our third party development business  through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to regular corporate level tax  and cannot avail themselves of the dividends paid deduction available to reits 
consequently  income from our third party development business  and any other income earned by taxable reit subsidiaries of ours  will be subject to corporate level tax 
certain deferred gains on assets owned by us are subject to special gain recognition rules as the result of prior asset transfers between members of the catellus consolidated group in pre reit years 
the maximum deferred gains associated with these assets is estimated to be million 
certain of these assets will be held by catellus with the remainder held by catellus operating limited partnership 
the special gain recognition rules require catellus to include in taxable income the previously deferred gain on assets upon the occurrence of certain events 
such gains would be taxable  for example  if the assets were contributed to a taxable reit subsidiary or sold  or if the catellus operating limited partnership admits a new partner and therefore becomes a separate entity for federal income tax purposes 
in addition  the internal revenue service may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years of catellus prior to the time we qualify as a reit  in which case we will owe such taxes plus interest and penalties  if any 
moreover  any increase in taxable income will result in an increase in accumulated earnings and profits which could either increase the taxable portion of the special e p distribution to our stockholders or cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our stockholders within days of the relevant determination 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk as our financial instruments are not subject to foreign exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
we continuously and actively monitor and manage interest costs on our debt and may enter into interest rate protection contracts based on changing market conditions 
at december   we did not have any interest rate protection contracts outstanding 
as of december   approximately of our debt bears interest at fixed rates and has a weighted average maturity of years and a weighted average coupon rate of 
the interest rate risk for fixed rate debt does not have a significant impact on the company until such debt matures and may need to be refinanced 
if coupon interest rate changed basis points  the effect on the fair value of our fixed rate debt would be approximately million 
the remainder of our debt bears interest at variable rates with a weighted average maturity of years and a weighted average coupon rate of 
to the extent that we incur additional variable rate indebtedness  we increase our exposure to increases in interest rates 
if coupon interest rate increased basis points  the annual effect would be an increase in interest expense of approximately million  based on the outstanding balance of our floating rate debt net of cash and restricted cash at december  we believe that moderate increases in interest expense as a result of inflation will not materially affect our financial position  results of operations  or cash flow
