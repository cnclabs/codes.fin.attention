item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
due to the severity and length of the downturn in the electronic component and computer product industry and in the global economy as a whole  the company has recorded charges in recent years that are discussed more fully in restructuring and other charges in this md a 
these charges have had a significant impact on the company s results of operations in each of the years presented in this report as discussed further below 
in addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  the company also discloses pro forma or non gaap measures that may exclude certain items 
management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods 
management believes the pro forma measures also help indicate underlying trends in the business 
management also uses pro forma information to establish operational goals and  in some cases  for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results and outlook on a pro forma or non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  data presented in accordance with gaap 
when used in this report  the words expects  anticipates  estimates  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of section a under the securities act of and section e under the securities exchange act of such statements include but are not limited to statements regarding the ability to obtain favorable product allocations and the ability to increase gross profit while controlling expenses 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially  including those risks described under risk factors in item hereof 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition bell s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
under specific conditions  we permit our customers to return or exchange products 
the provision for estimated returns is recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue based on historical sales returns and analysis of credit memorandum data 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and at december  it was million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in  our bad debt expense was million compared to million in in addition  included in restructuring and special charges were million of charges recorded in the second quarter that related to a rapid deterioration in the financial condition of certain customers in latin america resulting in their inability to make payments 
in the third quarter of  the company also recorded other special charges of million for additional accounts receivable provisions 
events giving rise to this provision related to the economic crisis in argentina and the devaluation of the argentinean peso  and a default on guaranteed debt of one of the company s large customers who filed for bankruptcy 
valuation of inventory inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
the company s inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  selling prices and market conditions 
in the first quarter of  we recorded inventory charges of million and during the second and third quarters of we recorded million of charges related to excess inventory on hand 
these additional write downs resulted from market conditions  changes to certain vendor relationships and the decision to discontinue certain product lines 
these charges were included in the statement of operations within the caption cost of sales 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers governing price protection  stock rotation and return privileges relating to obsolescence 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
special and acquisition related charges the company has been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the re evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  change in control expenses  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 
valuation of accounts payable our accounts payable has been reduced by amounts claimed to vendors for returns  price protection and other amounts related to incentive programs 
amounts related to price protection and other incentive programs are recorded as adjustments to product costs or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the program 
there is a time delay between the submission of a claim by us and confirmation of agreement by our vendors 
historically  our estimated claims have approximated amounts agreed to by our vendors 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net foreign operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  the company considers historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at december   goodwill amounted to million and identifiable intangible assets amounted to million 
we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate a possible impairment of goodwill 
in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill  we calculate the estimated fair value of our company based on the closing sales price of our common stock and projected discounted cash flows as of the date we perform the impairment tests 
we then compare the resulting fair value to our respective net book value  including goodwill 
if the net book value of our company exceeds its fair value  we measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of our goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize a goodwill impairment loss 
we perform this impairment test annually and whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there is a possible impairment of goodwill 
we completed the required annual impairment test  which resulted in no impairment for fiscal year we believe the methodology we use in testing impairment of goodwill provides us with a reasonable basis in determining whether an impairment charge should be taken
