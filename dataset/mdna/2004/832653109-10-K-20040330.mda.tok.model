words such as believe  may  could  expects  likely  variations of these words  and similar expressions  are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below in the section entitled factors that may affect future results  as well as those discussed in this item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
business overview we are a truckload carrier that provides nationwide transportation of diversified freight  concentrating primarily on the flatbed segment of the truckload market 
we offer comprehensive truckload transportation services to shippers located predominantly between the rocky mountains in the west and the appalachian mountains in the east  and in the southern provinces of canada 
beginning in and continuing through the present  truckload carriers have operated in a very difficult business environment 
a combination of high fuel prices  rising insurance premiums  tightened credit standards  a depressed used truck market  a declining number of independent contractors  and slowing freight demand associated with an economic downturn affected the profitability of many trucking companies  including smithway 
in addition to these general industry factors  the impact of the economic downturn on our customer base has been particularly severe  resulting in a more pronounced weakening in our freight demand than that experienced by truckload carriers generally 
since the fourth quarter of  several customers have experienced economic difficulties  some of which have declared bankruptcy 
it has only been in the last half of  that our industry has begun to feel the positive effects of an increase in freight demand and general economic improvement 
since the year  our revenues have decreased  to million in from million in  and  although our net loss of million for the year ending december was an improvement over our net losses of million and million for the years and  respectively  we have not operated profitably since the operating losses have had an adverse effect on our liquidity  and we were in violation of financial covenants under our primary financing arrangement several times during the year we obtained waivers for each such violation and since the beginning of  have successfully negotiated several amendments to the financing arrangement to provide for a remaining term of at least one year 
in the second quarter of  we began to implement a plan designed to return smithway to profitability by achieving a more streamlined and efficient operation 
the main goals of the first phase of the plan were to reduce fixed costs  eliminate less productive assets  and increase the productivity of remaining assets 
as part of this plan  we have  among other things o consolidated operations by closing terminals  including two with maintenance facilities  o improved our ratio of tractors to non driving personnel by reducing our headcount  o reduced the size of our tractor and trailer fleets to better match the revenue base  and o focused our equipment on the most profitable customers  lanes  and loads 
we are encouraged by the initial results of the plan 
revenue decreased by only despite a reduction in weighted average tractors and over a decrease in the number of terminals 
average revenue per tractor per week  our main measure of asset productivity  improved  to  in from  in  as we increased miles per tractor  reduced non revenue miles  and reduced the number of tractors without drivers 
in addition  we reduced our fixed costs of terminals  equipment  and non driving personnel  although these savings were partially offset by higher maintenance and fuel costs per mile 
the net result was an improvement of basis points in our operating ratio  to in from in the second phase of the plan  which we expect to implement in  focuses on revenue enhancements  replacing our highest mileage tractors  and continuing our cost control efforts 
the major components of this phase include the following o we are currently engaged in a broad based effort to raise our revenue per loaded mile  both generally and in respect of the new federally mandated hours of service requirements that may affect our productivity if we are not adequately compensated for lost driving time 
o we may selectively increase the size of our fleet  particularly through recruiting additional independent contractors and pursuing opportunities to take over dedicated fleets currently operated by shippers for their own account 
o we intend to replace between and of our highest mileage tractors  and we believe the savings in maintenance costs as well as better driver retention will more than offset increased capital costs 
we have received a financing commitment for new tractors 
o we intend to continue our cost control efforts 
based on the success of the first phase of the profit improvement plan  we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under our financing arrangement at december   and have successfully negotiated for the purchase and financing of new tractors in based upon our improving results  anticipated future cash flows  current availability under the financing arrangement with lasalle bank  and sources of equipment financing that we expect to be available  we do not expect to experience significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
revenues and expenses we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our services 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  and other accessorial services 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the united states economy  inventory levels  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  specific customer demand  and driver availability 
we monitor our revenue production primarily through average revenue per tractor per week 
in  our average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenues increased to  from  in we are encouraged by this improvement and by the fact that our operating revenue decreased only million  to million in from million in  while weighted average tractors decreased to  in from  in this reduction was part of our planned disposition of unseated company owned tractors 
in addition  we contracted with fewer independent contractor providers of equipment 
the decrease in the number of independent contractors primarily occurred in the first three quarters of and has slowed substantially since september as freight demand has increased and the economy has begun to rebound 
the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which are recorded under purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and financing of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and the compensation of non driver personnel 
effectively controlling our expenses is a key component of our profit improvement plan 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to revenue for the periods indicated operating revenue operating expenses purchased transportation compensation and employee benefits fuel  supplies  and maintenance insurance and claims taxes and licenses general and administrative communication and utilities depreciation and amortization total operating expenses earnings loss from operations interest expense  net loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net loss comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue decreased million  to million in from million in the decrease in operating revenue resulted from our planned reduction in fleet size to reduce the number of unmanned company owned tractors as well as from our yield management efforts  in which we ceased hauling certain unprofitable freight 
in addition  we contracted with fewer independent contractor providers of equipment 
the reduction in fleet size and yield enhancement efforts were consistent with our strategy of focusing on asset productivity 
we believe a certain level of success has been achieved  as our weighted average number of tractors decreased while operating revenue decreased only 
average operating revenue per tractor per week  our main measure of asset productivity  increased significantly to  in from  in operating revenue includes revenue from operating our trucks as well as other  more volatile  revenue items  including fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue 
we believe the analysis of tractor productivity is more meaningful if fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue are excluded from the computation 
average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue increased to  in from  in  primarily due to increased production from our seated equipment and a lower number of unseated company tractors 
for the year  revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue remained relatively constant at as rates were lower in the first half of the year and higher during the latter part of fuel surcharge revenue increased million to million in from million in during and  approximately million and million  respectively  of the fuel surcharge revenue collected helped to offset our fuel costs 
the remainder was passed through to independent contractors 
purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation decreased to in from in the changes reflect a decrease in the percentage of the fleet supplied by independent contractors and in the number of independent contractors 
the percentage of total operating revenue provided by independent contractors decreased to in from in we believe the decline in independent contractors as a percentage of our total fleet is attributable to high fuel costs  high insurance costs  tighter credit standards  and slow freight demand  which have diminished the pool of drivers interested in becoming or remaining independent contractors 
the decline in independent contractors has slowed significantly since september  as freight demand and the general economy has improved 
compensation and employee benefits decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits decreased slightly to in from in this reflects a million decrease in wages paid to non driver employees 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in the percentage of the fleet comprised of company owned tractors and additional wages paid to new drivers for sign on bonuses implemented to enhance driver recruiting 
additionally  in we recorded a  increase in reserves for workers compensation losses  including losses which have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
finally  health claims and premiums increased in compared with  and we expect this trend to continue in future periods 
fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased to of revenue in compared with in this reflects an increase in the percentage of the fleet comprised of company owned tractors  higher fuel prices  and a slight increase in maintenance costs 
we have seen an increase in maintenance expense in recent periods due to our extended trade cycle  however further increases in repair and maintenance expense are expected to be minimal as we begin to replace older equipment as part of the second phase of our profit improvement plan 
fuel prices increased approximately to an average of per gallon in from per gallon in the increase in fuel prices was partially offset by a million increase in fuel surcharge revenue  which is included in operating revenue 
insurance and claims decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims decreased to of revenue in compared with in in  insurance and claims included a million increase in reserves for auto liability losses 
the increase in liability reserves related primarily to a change in estimating the ultimate costs of claims that occurred in prior years and did not recur in also  in july  due to our financial condition and the rising cost of insurance  we discontinued our excess insurance coverage  leaving million of primary coverage with a  self insured retention  allowing for a substantial reduction in premiums 
we have had a  self insured retention since july  in january  we exercised an option to retroactively increase the deductible for our auto liability policy to  per incident beginning july  through june  which reduced our expense by  no changes were made to the other policies during that period 
prior to that time the retention was  the lack of excess coverage and high self insured retention increases our risk associated with frequency and severity of accidents and could increase our expenses or make them more volatile from period to period 
furthermore  if we experience claims that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  or if we experience claims for which coverage is not provided  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer a materially adverse effect 
the insurance policies are scheduled for renewal on july  upon renewal  we expect no changes in our self insured retention level or our excess insurance coverage limit 
if we are unable to renew the policies on their current terms  we may modify the self insured retention amount 
taxes and licenses remained constant at million in and the decrease in the number of company owned tractors subject to annual license and permit costs was offset by an increase in the need for over dimensional permits 
as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in general and administrative expenses decreased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses remained constant at of revenue in both years 
communications and utilities decreased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in depreciation and amortization decreased million  to million in from million in in accordance with industry practices  the gain or loss on retirement  sale  or write down of equipment is included in depreciation and amortization 
in and  depreciation and amortization included net gains from the sale of equipment of  and  respectively 
in depreciation and amortization included million for goodwill impairment 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to of revenue in compared with in excluding the goodwill impairment charge  depreciation and amortization was of revenue in the decreases as a percentage of revenue were attributable to a smaller fleet of company owned equipment  and some of our older equipment still generates revenue but is no longer being depreciated 
in the short term  we expect that the presence of older equipment which is not being depreciated will more than offset increases in depreciation resulting from the addition of new equipment to our fleet 
over the long term  as we continue to upgrade our equipment fleet  we expect depreciation expense to increase 
interest expense  net  decreased   to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to lower average debt outstanding  partially offset by higher interest rates 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net  remained constant at of revenue in both and as a result of the foregoing  our pre tax margin increased to in from in our income tax benefit in was million  or of loss before income taxes 
our income tax benefit in was million  or of loss before income taxes 
in both years  the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by us 
the impact of paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the level of our pre tax loss 
as a result of the factors described above  net loss was million in of revenue  compared with net loss of million in of revenue 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue decreased million  to million in from million in lower weighted average tractors  decreased fuel surcharge revenue  decreased brokerage revenue  and lower average revenue per tractor per week were responsible for the decrease in operating revenue 
weighted average tractors decreased to  in from  in as we disposed of a portion of our unseated company owned tractors in the last half of and contracted with fewer independent contractor providers of equipment 
fuel surcharge revenue decreased million to million in from million in during and  approximately million and million  respectively  of the fuel surcharge revenue collected helped to offset our fuel costs 
the remainder was passed through to independent contractors 
additionally  soft freight demand caused a million decrease in brokerage revenue  to million in from million in finally  average revenue per tractor per week excluding revenue from brokerage operations and fuel surcharges decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to a higher number of unseated company owned tractors during the first half of and lower weekly production caused by soft freight demand 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in revenue per loaded mile  net of surcharges  to in from in purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation decreased million  to million in from million in  as we contracted with fewer independent contractor providers of revenue equipment 
we believe the decline in independent contractors as a percentage of our total fleet is attributable to high fuel costs  high insurance costs  tighter credit standards  and slow freight demand  which have diminished the pool of drivers interested in becoming or remaining independent contractors 
as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation remained constant at in both years  as the drop in total operating revenue more than exceeded the drop in independent contractor revenue 
compensation and employee benefits decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits increased to in from in the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in reserves for workers compensation losses  including losses which have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
additionally  wages paid to drivers for unloaded miles increased during the year as weak freight demand caused an increase in deadhead miles 
finally  health claims and premiums increased in compared with  and we expect this trend to continue in future periods 
fuel  supplies  and maintenance decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance decreased to of revenue in compared with in this decrease was attributable primarily to lower fuel prices  which decreased approximately to an average of per gallon in from per gallon in the price decrease was partially offset by higher non billable miles for which we incur fuel expense but do not receive fuel surcharges 
although average fuel prices were lower than levels  fuel prices have risen over the last three quarters of  and have continued to rise in cost savings resulting from lower fuel prices were partially offset by higher maintenance expense resulting from i an increase in the percentage of our total fleet supplied by company owned equipment  and ii a slightly older fleet  as a result of our decision to further extend the trade cycle for tractors 
although the average age of our tractor fleet decreased during due to the sale of older equipment that was not replaced  we incurred increased maintenance expense on the aging units that remained in service 
insurance and claims increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims increased to of revenue in compared with in the increase was attributable to a million increase in reserves for auto liability losses 
the increase in liability reserves relates primarily to a change in the method of estimating the ultimate costs of claims  as well as the establishment of a reserve for incurred but not reported claims 
despite the increase in reserves  in we had our best safety year  in terms of accidents per million miles  since going public in the cost of insurance and claims increased substantially on july   when we increased our self insured retention from  to  per occurrence without a premium reduction that fully offset the increase in retention 
the higher self insured retention increases our risk associated with frequency and severity of accidents and could increase our expenses or make them more volatile from period to period 
taxes and licenses decreased   to million in from million in  reflecting a decrease in the number of company owned tractors subject to annual license and permit costs 
as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses remained constant at of revenue in and general and administrative expenses decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in communications and utilities decreased  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities remained constant at of revenue in both years 
depreciation and amortization increased   to million in from million in during the annual goodwill impairment analysis required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas  we determined that a portion of our goodwill had become impaired during the year primarily as a result of continuing operating losses 
as a result  we wrote off million of goodwill in the fourth quarter of in  we committed to a plan to replace our proprietary computer operating system with third party software 
accordingly  we wrote off the  carrying value of our existing software during the fourth quarter of in accordance with industry practices  the gain or loss on retirement  sale  or write down of equipment is included in depreciation and amortization 
in and  depreciation and amortization included net gains from the sale of equipment of  and  respectively 
in addition  included million for goodwill impairment and included  for the write off of a proprietary operating system 
increasing costs of new equipment continued to increase depreciation per tractor 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to of revenue in compared with in  primarily as a result of these factors 
excluding the write offs  depreciation and amortization remained constant at of revenue in and interest expense  net  decreased million  to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to lower interest rates and lower average debt outstanding 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net  decreased to of revenue in compared with in as a result of the foregoing  our pre tax margin decreased to in from in our income tax benefit in was million  or of loss before income taxes 
our income tax benefit in was million  or of loss before income taxes 
in both years  the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by us 
the impact of paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the level of our pre tax loss 
as a result of the factors described above  net loss was million in of revenue  compared with net loss of million in of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources uses and sources of cash we require cash to fund working capital requirements and to service our debt 
we have historically financed acquisitions of new equipment with borrowings under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers  borrowings under lines of credit  cash flow from operations  and equipment leases from third party lessors 
we also have obtained a portion of our revenue equipment fleet from independent contractors who own and operate the equipment  which reduces overall capital expenditure requirements compared with providing a fleet of entirely company owned equipment 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and borrowings under credit arrangements with financial institutions and equipment manufacturers 
we are experiencing improved cash flow as losses decrease 
as of the date of this report  we have adequate borrowing availability on our line of credit to finance any near term needs for working capital 
we have successfully negotiated  subject to certain conditions  for the purchase and financing of new tractors scheduled for delivery during our ability to fund cash requirements in future periods will depend on our ability to comply with covenants contained in financing arrangements and the availability of other financing options  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
our financial condition and results of operations will depend on insurance and claims experience  general shipping demand by the company s customers  fuel prices  the availability of drivers and independent contractors  continued success in implementing the profit improvement plan described above  and other factors 
although in the first quarter we experienced the traditional lag in shipping demand for flatbed freight  and there were weather related and hours of service operational issues  we expect the first quarter of to show improvement over the first quarter of going forward  we believe that seasonal improvements in shipping demand and continued focus on the profit improvement plan should generate the required improvements 
however  there is no assurance the improvements will occur as planned 
assuming the improvements do occur as planned  we believe there will be sufficient cash flow to meet our liquidity requirements at least through december  to the extent that actual results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may be unable to meet our financial covenants 
in such event  we believe we could renegotiate the terms of our debt or that alternative financing would be available  although this cannot be assured 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that cash generated by operations and available sources of financing for acquisitions of revenue equipment will be adequate to meet our currently anticipated working capital requirements and other cash needs through we will require additional sources of financing over the long term to upgrade our tractor and trailer fleets 
to the extent that actual results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may be unable to meet our financial covenants 
specifically  our short and long term liquidity may be adversely affected by one or more of the following factors costs associated with insurance and claims  weak freight demand or a loss in customer relationships or volume  the impact of new hours of service regulations on asset productivity  the ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and independent contractors  elevated fuel prices and the ability to collect fuel surcharges  inability to maintain compliance with  or negotiate amendments to  loan covenants  the ability to finance the tractors and trailers delivered and scheduled for delivery  and the possibility of shortened payment terms by our suppliers and vendors worried about our ability to meet payment obligations 
based upon our improving results  anticipated future cash flows  current availability under the financing arrangement with lasalle bank  and sources of equipment financing that we expect to be available  we do not expect to experience significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
historically  our principal use of cash from operations is to service debt and to internally finance acquisitions of revenue equipment 
total receivables decreased increased million  million  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the average age of our trade accounts receivable was approximately days for  days for  and days for net cash used in provided by investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
such amounts related primarily to purchases  sales  and trades of revenue equipment and payments made for the acquisition of skipper transportation  inc in in  sales of tractors and trailers as part of decreasing the size of our company owned tractor and trailer fleet more than offset the few purchases of revenue equipment 
net cash used in financing activities of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisted primarily of net payments of principal under our long term debt agreements 
we have a financing arrangement with lasalle bank  which expires on january   and provides for automatic month to month renewals under certain conditions after that date 
lasalle may terminate the arrangement prior to january   in the event of default  as discussed below  and may terminate at anytime during the renewal terms 
at several times since the beginning of  the financing arrangement has been amended to provide for a remaining term of at least one year 
the arrangement provides for a term loan  a revolving line of credit  a capital expenditure loan  and financing for letters of credit 
the combination of all loans with lasalle bank cannot exceed the lesser of million or a specified borrowing base 
at december   the term loan had a principal balance of million  payable in remaining equal monthly principal installments of  the revolving line of credit allows for borrowings up to percent of eligible receivables 
at december   total borrowings under the revolving line were  the capital expenditure loan allows for borrowing up to percent of the purchase price of revenue equipment purchased with such advances  provided borrowings under the capital expenditure loan are limited to million annually  and million over the term of the arrangement 
at december   the amount owed under capital expenditure notes was million 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million for self insured amounts under our insurance programs 
these letters of credit directly reduce the amount of potential borrowings available under the financing arrangement 
any increase in self insured retention  as well as increases in claim reserves  may require additional letters of credit to be posted  which would negatively affect our liquidity 
at december   our borrowing limit under the financing arrangement was million  leaving approximately million in remaining availability at such date 
we are required to pay a facility fee on the lasalle financing arrangement of 
of the maximum loan limit million 
borrowings under the arrangement are secured by liens on revenue equipment  accounts receivable  and certain other assets 
the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the arrangement is equal to lasalle s prime rate plus two percent 
the lasalle financing arrangement requires compliance with certain financial covenants  including compliance with a minimum tangible net worth  capital expenditure limits  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  and we believe we will remain in compliance  although there can be no assurance that the required financial performance will be achieved 
in addition  equipment financing provided by a manufacturer contains a minimum tangible net worth requirement 
we were in compliance with the required minimum tangible net worth requirement for december  and we expect to remain in compliance going forward 
if we fail to maintain compliance with these financial covenants  or to obtain a waiver of any noncompliance  the lenders will have the right to declare all sums immediately due and pursue other remedies 
in such event  we believe we could renegotiate the terms of our debt or that alternative financing would be available  although this cannot be assured 
as of the filing date  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables set forth the contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments in thousands due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt     operating leases total     we had no other commercial commitments at december  off balance sheet arrangements our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
during  we incurred minimal rental expense related to operating leases 
we do not expect to utilize operating leases to finance any material amount of revenue equipment going forward 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note of the consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
other footnotes describe various elements of the financial statements and the assumptions on which specific amounts were determined 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we generally recognize operating revenue when the freight to be transported has been loaded 
we operate primarily in the short to medium length haul category of the trucking industry  therefore  our typical customer delivery is completed one day after pickup 
accordingly  this method of revenue recognition is not materially different from recognizing revenue based on completion of delivery 
we recognize operating revenue when the freight is delivered for longer haul loads where delivery is completed more than one day after pickup 
amounts payable to independent contractors for purchased transportation  to company drivers for wages  and other direct expenses are accrued when the related revenue is recognized 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided by use of the straight line and declining balance methods over lives of to years for buildings and improvements  years for tractors  years for trailers  and to years for other equipment 
tires purchased as part of revenue equipment are capitalized as a cost of the equipment 
replacement tires are expensed when placed in service 
expenditures for maintenance and minor repairs are charged to operations  and expenditures for major replacements and betterments are capitalized 
the cost and related accumulated depreciation on property and equipment retired  traded  or sold are eliminated from the property accounts at the time of retirement  trade  or sale 
the gain or loss on retirement or sale is included in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operation 
gains on trade ins are included in the basis of the new asset 
judgments concerning salvage values and useful lives can have a significant impact 
estimated liability for insurance claims losses resulting from auto liability  physical damage  workers compensation  and cargo loss and damage are covered by insurance subject to certain self retention levels 
losses resulting from uninsured claims are recognized when such losses are incurred 
we estimate and accrue a liability for our share of ultimate settlements using all available information 
we accrue for claims reported  as well as for claims incurred but not reported  based upon our past experience 
expenses depend on actual loss experience and changes in estimates of settlement amounts for open claims which have not been fully resolved 
however  final settlement of these claims could differ materially from the amounts we have accrued at year end 
our judgment concerning the ultimate cost of claims and modification of initial reserved amounts is an important part of establishing claims reserves  and is of increasing significance with higher self insured retention and lack of excess coverage 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
our judgment concerning future cash flows is an important part of this determination 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas supersedes eitf no 
the principal difference between sfas and eitf no 
relates to when an entity can recognize a liability related to exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
eitf no 
allowed a liability  related to an exit or disposal activity  to be recognized at the date an entity commits to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas were effective on january  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had an impact on our financial statements as of december  in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on disclosure requirements of obligations by a guarantor under certain guarantees 
this interpretation also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of an obligation undertaken in issuing a guarantee 
we applied the provisions of interpretation no 
for initial recognition and measurement provisions to guarantees issued or modified after december   as required 
we did not have any guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  as of december   which would require disclosure under interpretation no 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
 as revised  requires an entity to consolidate a variable interest entity if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the entity does not have a majority of voting interests 
a variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity where its equity is unable to finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risk and rewards of ownership 
the provisions of this interpretation must be applied at the beginning of the first interim or annual period ending after march  the application of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it applies to contracts entered into or modified after june   except as stated within the statement  and is to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on may   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires issuers to classify as liabilities or assets in some circumstances three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer 
generally  sfas no 
applies to financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise became effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition  which codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab no 
 revenue recognition  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and securities and exchange commission rules and regulations 
the changes noted in sab no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions in august  we generated approximately  of cash and avoided future premium payments by selling one of our two life insurance policies covering our late chief executive officer to such officer for the cash surrender value 
the transferred policy has a death benefit of million and the policy retained by us has a death benefit of  the transaction was approved by the disinterested directors 
during the years ended december   and there were no material transactions with related parties 
inflation and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices  the compensation paid to drivers  and fuel prices 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
we attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
the failure to obtain rate increases in the future could adversely affect profitability 
high fuel prices also decrease our profitability 
most of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although we attempt to pass through increases in fuel prices to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  the fuel price increases are not fully recovered 
seasonality in the trucking industry results of operations show a seasonal pattern because customers generally reduce shipments during the winter season  and we experience some seasonality due to the open  flatbed nature of the majority of our trailers 
we at times have experienced delays in meeting shipment schedules as a result of severe weather conditions  particularly during the winter months 
in addition  our operating expenses have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
factors that may affect future results we may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
we rely on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  we hereby identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by us or on our behalf 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following losses and liquidity concerns 
we have reported operating losses for the past three years and a net loss for the past four years 
failure to turn around the losses could result in further violation of current and future financing covenants  which could accelerate our indebtedness 
in such an event  our liquidity  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially and adversely impacted 
although we have been encouraged by the recent improvements  there is no assurance that we will not experience liquidity constraints going forward 
insurance 
the lack of excess coverage and high self insured retention increases our risk associated with the frequency and severity of accidents and could increase our expenses or make them more volatile from period to period 
furthermore  if we experience claims that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  or if we experience claims for which coverage is not provided  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer a materially adverse effect 
general economic and business factors 
our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include excess capacity in the trucking industry  significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates  fuel taxes  and insurance and claims costs  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges 
our results of operations also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries in which we have a concentration of customers 
in addition  our results of operations are affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments during the winter months 
despite higher oil inventories  concerns in oil producing countries have caused fuel prices to rise throughout shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
capital requirements 
the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
historically  we have depended on cash from operations  equipment financing  and debt financing for funds to update our revenue equipment fleet 
since we have slowed our growth and extended our trade cycle on tractors and trailers 
we had minimal capital expenditures in we have successfully negotiated  subject to certain conditions  for the purchase and financing of new tractors scheduled for delivery during going forward we will need to continue to upgrade our tractor and trailer fleets 
we expect to pay for the projected capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and borrowings from equipment manufacturers or under the financing arrangement with lasalle bank 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms in the future  we may have to enter into less favorable financing arrangements or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability 
revenue equipment 
in the short term  we expect the presence of older equipment which is not being depreciated will more than offset increases in depreciation resulting from the new equipment purchases 
over the long term  as we continue to upgrade our equipment fleet  we expect depreciation expense to increase 
if revenue production does not increase or remains constant  the increased depreciation could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
competition for drivers and independent contractors is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
we have successfully reduced the number of company owned tractors without drivers during by improving recruiting and retention of drivers and by disposing of unseated equipment 
in addition  independent contractors have decreased industry wide for a variety of economic reasons 
the decline in independent contractors has slowed significantly since september the shortage of drivers and independent contractors has constrained revenue production 
failure to recruit additional drivers and independent contractors could force us to increase compensation or limit fleet size  either of which could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
competition 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  and to some extent railroads and rail intermodal service 
competition is based primarily on service  efficiency  and freight rates 
many competitors offer transportation service at lower rates than us 
our results could suffer if we cannot obtain higher rates 
acquisitions 
in march  we acquired the assets of skipper transportation  inc  a small flatbed carrier headquartered in birmingham  alabama 
this is the only acquisition we have made during the past three years 
in  we hope to expand the size of our tractor fleet through the acquisition of one identified dedicated fleet operation  which will add approximately independent contractors during the course of the year 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the risks of entering into markets in which management has no or only limited direct experience  and the potential loss of customers  key employees and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we make any acquisitions in the future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired companies or assets into our business 
regulation 
the trucking industry is subject to various governmental regulations 
effective january   the dot established new hours of service rules which effectively reduced the hours in service during which a driver may operate a tractor by redefining periods of service 
the epa has promulgated air emission standards that have increased the cost of tractor engines and reduce fuel mileage 
although we are unable to predict the nature of any changes in regulations  the cost of any changes  if implemented  may adversely affect our profitability 
we have implemented several steps to address asset productivity issues caused by these regulations 
the predominately flatbed nature of our operations  in which more of the freight is loaded on the trailers while the driver and tractor wait  has caused increased operational and productivity issues 
it is still too early to ascertain the ultimate effect of these regulations 
however  based on our initial experience  our preliminary expectation is that for some period of time there will be decreased productivity on at least a portion of our fleet 
if we are unable to pass these additional costs through to shippers  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  most importantly the effects of the price and availability of diesel fuel and changes in interest rates 
commodity price risk our operations are heavily dependent upon the use of diesel fuel 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can vary and are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are beyond our control 
significant increases in diesel fuel prices could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we presently use fuel surcharges to address the risk of increasing fuel prices 
we believe these fuel surcharges are an effective means of mitigating the risk of increasing fuel prices  although the competitive nature of our industry prevents us from recovering the full amount of fuel price increases through the use of such surcharges 
in the past  we have used derivative instruments  including heating oil price swap agreements  to reduce a portion of our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
since we have had no such agreements in place 
we do not trade in such derivatives with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations 
interest rate risk we also are exposed to market risks from changes in certain interest rates on our debt 
our financing arrangement with lasalle bank provides for a variable interest rate based on lasalle s prime rate plus two percent  provided there has been no default 
in addition  approximately million of our other debt carries variable interest rates 
this variable interest exposes us to the risk that interest rates may rise 
assuming borrowing levels at december   a one point increase in the prime rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately  the remainder of our other debt carries fixed interest rates and exposes us to the risk that interest rates may fall 
at december   approximately of our debt carries a variable interest rate and the remainder is fixed
