item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
part i item business general dade behring holdings  inc also referred to as we  us and our is a leading manufacturer and distributor of in vitro diagnostics ivd products and services to clinical laboratories in the united states 
dade behring serves approximately billion of the billion annual worldwide market for ivd products 
we focus primarily on the central lab segment of the ivd market  which accounts for approximately billion of total ivd sales 
we manufacture and market a broad offering of ivd products and services which include medical diagnostic instruments  which represent approximately of our sales  reagents and consumables  which represent approximately of our sales  and maintenance services which represent approximately of our sales 
reagents and consumables sales include revenue from instrument rentals included in customer contracts where equipment is placed with end customers in exchange for contractual commitments for ongoing reagent revenues 
in total  we have a worldwide installed base of approximately  diagnostic instruments 
this installed base statistic has been adjusted down as of december  from  units to remove mature product line instruments that are being phased out of our product portfolio over the next two years  and older non strategic instruments 
within our served markets  we have a strong position in each of our core product markets which are chemistry  hemostasis  microbiology and infectious disease diagnostics 
in december  bain capital  inc and the gs capital partners  lp and certain of their affiliates formed dade behring holdings  inc  and acquired certain assets of baxter diagnostics from baxter international inc the assets acquired from baxter international  inc included established leadership positions in hemostasis and microbiology  strong routine chemistry immunoassay market positions  and an extensive sales and service organization  especially in the united states 
in may  we purchased dupont s ivd business  which had entered into the automated clinical chemistry market in with the introduction of the first random access automated chemistry analyzer in the world and whose installed base of routine chemistry instruments was and still is one of the largest in the world 
this acquisition also provided dade behring holdings  inc with world class manufacturing and product development capabilities  particularly in the areas of software and engineering 
in october  we acquired behring diagnostics the human ivd business of hoechst ag 
the behring business was established in by emil von behring the recipient of the first nobel prize in medicine 
this acquisition provided us with complementary products for our hemostasis and routine immunochemistry product lines and significantly broadened the overall product line portfolio by adding leadership positions in plasma protein testing and drugs of abuse testing therapeutic drug monitoring 
acquisition of the behring clinical ivd business from hoechst provided expanded capabilities in platform development  specialty assay development and research and extended the geographic scope of our business 
bankruptcy proceedings on august   dade behring holdings  inc and certain of its wholly owned direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of title of the united states bankruptcy code  as amended  with the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois 
we collectively refer to the companies who were party to the bankruptcy proceedings as the debtors 
on august   the debtors filed their disclosure statement and plan of reorganization for their joint chapter case the plan of reorganization 
the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of reorganization on september  and the plan of reorganization became effective on october  the plan of reorganization allowed the debtors to emerge from bankruptcy with an improved capital structure 
the debtors were allowed to continue paying their trade debt in the ordinary course of business during the pendency of the chapter cases 
at the time of emergence  the debtors had sufficient trade credit to finance their continuing operations 
on the effective date of the plan of reorganization  dade behring inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  entered into new credit facilities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations bankruptcy proceedings and credit facilities in part ii  item for a further discussion 
diagnostic industry overview ivd tests are conducted outside the body 
ivd tests are used to analyze samples of patients bodily fluids such as whole blood  blood plasma  serum or urine in a clinical setting 
in a single test  a patient sample may be measured to determine the presence  concentration or absence of a particular substance or condition 
in some tests  the fluid sample is combined with a dry or liquid chemical reagent  which is then observed or measured to observe physical or chemical changes that have a predetermined correlation to diagnostic information and enable physicians to diagnose  treat and monitor patients 
the most common ivd tests are traditional routine clinical chemistry tests that measure substances such as glucose  cholesterol or sodium as part of routine blood checks 
other ivd tests measure other bodily functions such as blood clotting ability and cardiac function  or measure the presence of infections or drugs 
the wide range and important nature of these tests have established ivd testing as an integral part of the managed care environment  providing for accurate and timely patient diagnosis and treatment 
increasingly  ivd testing is recognized as making a significant contribution to improving patient care and lowering total patient costs 
ivd tests are performed in a number of different clinical settings  including hospitals  reference laboratories  physicians offices ambulatory care centers  criminal justice system specialty labs and consumers homes 
ivd testing systems are composed of instruments  reagents  consumables  service and data management components 
instruments serve to automate repetitive manual tasks  improve test accuracy and speed results reporting 
reagents are liquid or powdered biochemical substances that react with the patient sample to produce measurable  objective results 
the consumable accessories vary across application segments  but are generally items such as vessels used in generating test results 
reagents and consumables that are exclusive to their related testing systems represent closed systems  which generally provide more predictable future revenue to the system supplier 
open testing systems accept reagents and consumables from more than a single manufacturer 
sample handling and preparation devices  as well as data management systems  are becoming increasingly important components of the ivd system 
these additional system components permit laboratories to achieve cost efficiencies and higher test volumes 
the global ivd market is estimated at billion annually  with the united states  western europe and japan comprising approximately  and  respectively  of the global market 
we primarily serve the central lab market  which comprises billion of the billion global ivd market 
we believe that the global ivd market will continue to grow due to a number of key favorable industry trends  including demographic shifts resulting from the aging of the population and socioeconomic improvements which are expected to increase the overall level of demand for diagnostic testing  increased focus on lowering total healthcare expenditures which will likely increase demand for diagnostic testing as an effective tool to improve patient outcomes and reduce the costs of misdiagnosis through earlier and more accurate diagnosis and patient monitoring  emerging markets which will likely provide additional demand as economic improvements in these countries lead to increases in healthcare expenditures  technology improvements in new tests  pathogens and markers which will likely result in the increased use of diagnostics to aid in the diagnosis of diseases  and increased automation of diagnostic instruments which is expected to lower the overall cost of diagnostic testing and thereby increase accessibility and demand 
dade behring served markets we derive substantially all of our revenues from manufacturing and marketing ivd products and services 
we are organized functionally and are comprised of three reporting segments global customer management gcm north america  gcm international  and global operations 
gcm north america and gcm international are our sales and service organizations 
global operations primarily includes all manufacturing and research and development activities  which occur in the united states and germany  and accordingly does not recognize significant revenues 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for segment and geographic area financial information 
this and the following sections discuss our served markets whose results are reported in the gcm north america and gcm international segments 
chemistry diagnostics 
our chemistry diagnostics business consists of four product lines routine chemistry immunochemistry  cardiac  plasma proteins and drugs of abuse testing therapeutic drug monitoring 
these product lines contributed approximately million of our sales during the twelve months ended december routine chemistry immunochemistry 
routine chemistry tests measure substances found in large concentrations in patients blood  tissue  urine or other bodily fluids 
some of these substances include chemistry tests such as cholesterol  glucose  iron and sodium and their concentration levels provide information on a patient s basic bodily functions 
routine immunochemistry testing relies on the properties of antibodies and antigens in the immune system as its key detection mechanism 
immunoassays  which are immunochemistry tests  measure relatively low concentrations of these substances found in blood 
historically  analyzers had been developed separately for routine chemistry and immunochemistry testing 
today  high volume tests in both categories are rapidly being consolidated to a single platform that significantly improves overall laboratory productivity and costs 
on average  hospital laboratories operate two to three routine chemistry immunochemistry analyzers 
these instruments account for up to of all ivd tests performed in clinical laboratories and are characterized by their high throughput capabilities 
we have a routine chemistry immunochemistry instrument platform called the dimension 
we have consistently been a leader in chemistry immunochemistry instrument consolidation and automation  beginning with our introduction of the heterogeneous module for the dimension rxl instrument in in we introduced the dimension xpand instrument  which provides the same test consolidation capability as the dimension rxl for smaller labs 
the continued consolidation of routine chemistry immunochemistry testing onto a single platform represents a significant growth opportunity for us 
we believe that the dimension system offers customers the lowest total cost approach for performing these two categories of tests along with a wide menu and a significant technological advantage over competitive systems 
in addition  the dimension platforms offer a comprehensive test menu of approximately tests and we are currently developing additional chemistry and immunochemistry tests 
in  we introduced the streamlab chemistry immunochemistry analyzer  a workcell that combines up to four dimension rxl instruments with onboard pre analytical capabilities of accessioning  centrifugation and aliquotting that are essential to laboratory processes for producing test results 
this instrument gives our customers in high volume laboratories an integrated single platform solution 
staffing and budget concerns in clinical laboratories worldwide suggest that instrument consolidation will become even more compelling to our customers over time 
our unique approach to workstation consolidation integrates the immunoassay  or ia  detection capability into the chemistry analyzer itself rather than simply connecting separate chemistry and ia units with a common sample handler 
integration results in a lower cost per instrument  which is one reason why the dimension rxl and dimension xpand products remain attractive to medium and lower volume laboratories 
building on our approach to workstation consolidation  we are currently developing a next generation system called dimension vista  which we anticipate will be fully commercialized sometime in see factors that could affect future results at the end of item for a discussion of risk factors related to the release of new products 
the initial platform will serve the high volume testing segment  but the same platform architecture will provide the basic building blocks for new consolidating instruments designed to serve the medium and lower volume laboratories as well 
cardiac 
cardiac tests are used for both risk assessment and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease cvd 
the cardiac market is one of the highest growth segments of the broader immunochemistry market  growing at annually 
we have a leading share in the market for cardiac tests and were one of the first to introduce a widely adopted testing system for the cardiac proteins troponin i  ck mb and myoglobin 
the combination of rapid and accurate tests for these cvd markers has allowed for rapid diagnosis of cardiac disease and has enhanced the physician s ability for triage and diagnosis of chest pain in patients 
we offer a unique combination of platforms for performing cardiac tests 
in the central laboratory  the dimension rxl  bn ii  and bn prospec instruments offer tests for cardiac risk assessment such as cholesterol  hdl  ldl  apolipoprotein  and high sensitivity crp 
we have led the development of the market for high sensitivity crp testing for cardiac application 
in addition to cardiac risk assessment tests  the dimension rxl menu also includes the three major cardiac tests for cardiac necrosis  troponin i  ck mb and myoglobin 
in the acute care near patient setting  we offer cardiac testing on our stratus cs acute care diagnostic system 
launched in  the stratus cs system represents the industry s first quantitative  near patient cardiac instrument 
the stratus cs system s rapid result time of approximately minutes in the acute care setting provides physicians with cardiac test results in under the minute recommendation of cardiac societies such as american heart association  american college of cardiologists  and european society of cardiologists 
the analytical performance sensitivity of nanograms per milliliter and precision of coefficient of variation at the th percentile of normal of the stratus cs acute care troponin i along with its rapid results  offers significant potential cost savings for healthcare providers and improve patient outcomes by identifying acute coronary syndrome acs patients faster and more accurately 
currently  the average cost to rule out myocardial infarction in a patient with chest pain ranges from  to  stratus cs system can achieve a result in approximately minutes at a cost of less than per test  which saves significant time over conventional diagnostic measures  reduces hospital lengths of stay  avoids unnecessary testing and thereby reduces healthcare costs significantly 
the stratus cs acute care menu also includes acute care d dimer  which has been shown to aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism pe 
pe patients often present the same symptoms as acs patients 
the addition of d dimer testing to the cardiac testing enables the physician to better differentiate the cause of a patient s chest pain allowing for proper treatment of the patient 
plasma protein 
plasma protein instrument systems test serum  plasma  urine or cerebral spinal fluid to help both diagnose diseases  such as coronary heart diseases and rheumatic diseases  as well as to detect disorders  such as tumors  renal failure and malnutrition 
plasma protein tests are conducted on two types of instrument platforms  routine chemistry immunochemistry analyzers such as our dimension instrument and dedicated nephelometers such as our bn ii and bn prospec instruments 
while higher volumes of protein tests are run on routine chemistry immunochemistry systems  the quality and broad menu makes nephelometers extremely useful for customers willing to pay a premium price for this utility 
we are the market leader in the worldwide nephelometric plasma protein market 
we offer five dedicated plasma protein instruments the bn ii instrument  targeted at large  high volume hospital and commercial laboratories  the bna  bn and bn prospec instruments  sold to small to medium size labs  and the turbitime system  a manual instrument sold to small hospitals and private labs 
the bn ii instrument  a large  highly automated instrument  was released in late and has proven to be a successful upgrade path for former customers of our older systems who are striving to reduce lab costs and increase actual testing throughput 
our instruments offer a menu of up to assays  which cover the complete spectrum of plasma protein tests 
the bn prospec instrument  which targets the small to medium size customer group  was launched in given our long history of leadership in nephelometric protein testing  and our success at introducing and developing markets for critical  protein based immunoassays such as myoglobin and troponin i  we are aggressively assessing options for connecting our historical strength to the exciting advances that we expect from proteomics research 
in addition to stepping up our licensing capabilities  we are evaluating our platform strategy to determine how the bn prospec class analyzer and next generation dimension instruments can be equipped to handle the sensitivity requirements of new markers that are discovered through proteomics research 
drugs of abuse testing therapeutic drug monitoring 
drug tests are used to measure the level of therapeutic drugs tdm or drugs of abuse dat in either blood or urine 
tdm tests assist physicians in ensuring that the level of therapeutic drugs patients receive do not exceed safe ranges in the bloodstream 
an example of a tdm application is testing performed on transplant patients to monitor the level of immunosuppressive drugs that they are given 
drugs of abuse tests screen for the use of illicit substances such as cocaine and marijuana 
because of their range of application  drugs tests are used at a variety of sites  from clinical laboratories to employers offices 
dade behring offers drug tests on its dimension analyzers as well as through its syva reagents 
we manufacture a wide range of products under the syva brand name  which we market to both clinical and non clinical laboratories 
syva is recognized worldwide in dat testing  with a broad menu of assays available 
in order to increase the convenience of testing for our customers  we have developed ready to use liquid dat reagents for a broad range of commercially available instrument platforms 
this makes syva an attractive choice for dat assays among open system reagent providers 
we also have a strong position in the tdm market including the high growth immunosuppressives market 
during  we launched the new v twin system for the syva product line 
the v twin system is distributed worldwide and is configured to run our emit branded drugs of abuse and serum toxicology assays  as well as the perfect specimen validity tests 
hemostasis diagnostics 
hemostasis testing measures a patient s ability to form and dissolve blood clots  a critical factor in the stabilization of the cardiovascular system 
hemostasis testing can be segmented into routine screening and specialty tests 
routine hemostasis tests are typically performed before and during surgical procedures 
hemostasis testing is also essential in post surgical treatments for patients with cardiovascular disorders such as monitoring treatments to thin the blood  and for patients with coagulation disorders such as hemophilia 
specialty tests are performed to further characterize congenital disease states 
market growth is expected to come from a continued growth in the number of surgeries performed as well as from new hemostasis tests  which more accurately measure blood clotting and allow for improved patient treatment 
since hemostasis is a critical component of cardiovascular disease treatment  pharmaceutical companies are currently conducting significant research directed at modulating hemostasis  which should also lead to increased testing as new pharmaceuticals are introduced 
we pioneered the field of hemostasis and with revenues of approximately million during the twelve months ended december  we continue to maintain a global leadership position through our commitment to innovation and our development of new and improved products and services 
we offer a broad range of instrument platforms and both routine and specialty tests to meet the needs of customers from small hospitals to large reference labs 
we have a strong history of instrument product development  internally and with our development partner  sysmex corporation  and are capitalizing on an emerging technology opportunity with a system for monitoring platelet function  which is an essential component of primary hemostasis 
we believe this will be a high growth market as new anti platelet therapies are developed and introduced 
microbiology diagnostics 
we serve the microbiology market with our microscan products 
microbiology laboratories use identification antibiotic susceptibility testing id ast products such as microscan s to identify infection causing bacteria such as streptococci and staphylococci  and to determine the minimum concentration of antibiotic such as erythromycin and ampicillin  necessary to inhibit or kill the bacteria 
this information is critical to the optimum management of patient therapy 
continued evolutions in the microbiology testing market have been driven primarily by advances in automation  new antibiotics  the complexity of various microbes  and the increasing resistance of microbes to antibiotics 
we manufacture and market both manual and automated id ast products 
our premier instruments  the autoscan  the microscan walkaway si and the walkaway si  are fully automated and use patented dry reagent panels to conduct bacterial identification and susceptibility testing at the same time 
we are a leader in automated id ast microbiology systems and have been able to maintain our position in the microbiology market by focusing on continuous instrument and panel product enhancement and high growth international markets  as well as by upgrading our instruments to help laboratories reduce their overall costs 
in the united states  we continue to secure business through the promotion of our conventional testing device panels  which produce more accurate results than competitive systems 
microscan has a reputation for being the leader in providing accurate tests for emerging antibiotic resistant organisms and was the first to have a test for the critical vancomycin intermediate resistant staphylococcus aureus 
microscan revenues were approximately million of our revenues during the twelve months ended december and were derived almost entirely from the automated portion of the id ast market 
the total market for id ast testing is approximately million within an overall microbiology market of billion 
infectious disease diagnostics 
infectious disease diagnostic systems test for the presence of infectious microorganisms 
this market consists of bacteriology  parasitology and virology testing  including hiv and hepatitis testing 
these tests are used not only to diagnose disease  but also as screening tests in order to insure a safe blood supply 
we have a strong niche position in infectious disease diagnostics 
infectious disease testing is one of the largest segments of the diagnostics market and accounted for approximately million of our revenues during the twelve months ended december the microtitre plate  or mtp  subsegment  manual and semi automated  makes up approximately one third of the immunoassay testing in this segment 
mtp is a high throughput  low cost testing method  ideal for blood banks 
in the european mtp segment  our bep systems are used by more laboratories than any other batch analyzer 
in addition  we possess a strong intellectual property position for hiv o  a variant of hiv recently discovered 
due to the increased prevalence of hiv o  any future hiv test platform will have to include hiv o to offer full hiv testing capability 
we continue to invest in expanded test menu capabilities on our existing instrument line and launched our bep and quadriga instruments in and  respectively  to allow us to better serve the high volume blood bank market 
these instruments have met with outstanding acceptance in a number of european blood banks 
sales and marketing we have a global customer management organization that employs approximately  people worldwide 
our global customer management organization includes elements beyond traditional sales representatives and marketing personnel and includes healthcare consultants  clinical quality initiatives managers  field service engineers  national accounts gpo group purchasing organization management  integrated distribution networks idn management  inside sales  clinical application specialist  customer service representatives  technical assistance  customer operations  pricing analysts and field sales and service management 
our global customer management executives have long tenure both in the ivd industry and with dade behring 
similarly  the experience profile of our customer contact personnel is generally one of long service in the industry and with dade behring 
we utilize a generalist sales force approach  but all countries with significant sales of specific products have specialists who are trained to service specific product lines 
because of the sales volume and market penetration of our chemistry immunochemistry  microbiology  hemostasis  cardiac risk assessment  protein and therapeutic drug products  most sales representatives  specialists and generalists are familiar with the features and benefits of these products 
we use a dedicated health systems sales team in the united states that focuses exclusively on serving the larger hospital networks and reference laboratories which represent an increasingly important portion of the customer base as healthcare delivery undergoes continued consolidation 
our products are presented to customers through most of the larger group purchasing arrangements serving hospital and reference laboratories 
the health systems team provides overlay support for individual sales representatives 
our key focus is on providing solutions to the challenges our customers are faced with in their laboratories 
we have developed a healthcare consulting and clinical quality initiative organization to identify and find ways to provide these solutions 
areas we focus on include work station consolidation  patient specimen filing and storage  workflow analysis  improved testing and turnaround  and ways to insure integrity in patient information 
we have a long history and strong reputation in the clinical diagnostics industry for delivering the highest quality customer satisfaction related to our sales and service organization 
research and development we conduct research and development in the united states and in germany 
research and development activities are grouped into two primary categories across all product segments platform and systems development and test menu development 
at december   there were approximately employees involved in our research and development efforts worldwide 
platform and systems development is focused on the design of new instruments that bring increased automation to clinical laboratory operation and appeal to customers by offering broad test menus  high volume testing  integration of multiple laboratory functions  ease of use and the opportunity to lower operating costs 
test menu development seeks to improve the efficacy of existing products and to develop tests that extend our existing product offerings 
our research and development teams are skilled in a number of engineering disciplines and life sciences including focus areas of chemistry immunochemistry  microbiology  hemostasis  informatics  applying robotics to sample processing and systems engineering 
our products are developed internally using a multifunctional team approach which integrates our internal capabilities of engineering and assay development with regulatory and quality systems  marketing  technical support and manufacturing 
although we continue to develop or license all of our hemostasis reagents and controls  in recent years  new hemostasis instruments have been sourced through an external instrumentation partner using a similar approach 
research and development expense was million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year patents  trademarks and licenses we own or have licensed over  patents in the united states and foreign countries that cover our products and have also developed brand names and trademarks for our products 
we own numerous united states and foreign registered trademarks and service marks and have applications for the registration of trademarks and service marks pending in the united states and abroad 
we also own several united states copyright registrations 
in addition  we own a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how 
further  we license certain intellectual property rights from third parties 
our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property 
in each of our business segments  these patents  patent applications  trademarks  copyrights and licenses are  in the aggregate  of significant importance to our business 
however  we believe that no single patent  trademark or copyright or related group of patents  trademarks or copyrights is material in relation to our business as a whole 
competition the ivd industry is highly competitive  however  there are substantial barriers to entry including the necessity for significant sales  service and distribution infrastructure  research and development infrastructure that requires engineering and informatics skills necessary to design and commercialize complex instruments and the life science skills necessary to develop the diagnostic tests  and finally the highly regulated environment for our products 
we encounter competition from domestic and international manufacturers that compete in some or all of the markets that we serve 
some of our competitors are large diversified healthcare companies with substantial resources 
we believe that in recent years  the key competitive factors for diagnostic testing products have been quality  service  price and ease of use 
for automated and consolidated instrument platforms  menu breadth is of increasing importance 
our competitors include abbott laboratories diagnostics division  bayer ag diagnostics business group  beckman coulter  biomerieux vitek product line  johnson johnson ortho clinical diagnostics  inc  and roche group diagnostics division 
regulatory matters most aspects of our business are subject to some degree of government regulation in the countries in which we operate 
in addition to regulations intended to ensure product safety and effectiveness  our business is subject to regulation concerned with protecting the environment and occupational health and safety 
for some products  and in some countries  government regulation is significant and  in general  there is a trend towards more stringent regulation 
our policy is to comply fully with all regulatory requirements applying to our products and operations 
governmental regulatory actions can result in the recall or seizure of products  suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for production or sale  and other civil  monetary and criminal sanctions 
in the united states  the medical device and in vitro diagnostic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal  state and local agencies  primarily regarding product manufacturing  safety  efficacy and labeling 
government agencies in the united states as well as other countries have expressed concern about costs of health care and in some cases have focused attention on diagnostic test utilization 
regulations in these areas already exists in some countries and may be expanded significantly in the united states and other countries in the future 
we devote significant time  effort and expense to addressing regulatory requirements applicable to our business 
our quality and regulatory compliance training and well established manufacturing practices have consistently allowed us to successfully introduce and maintain the manufacture and distribution of instrument and reagent products that satisfy regulatory standards as well as our customers requirements for quality 
although we are unable to predict the extent to which our business may be affected by future regulatory developments  we expect that our own business would not be disproportionately burdened by future regulation 
we believe that the integration we have achieved between our engineering and life sciences capabilities and our substantial experience addressing and accommodating regulatory requirements and restrictions on our operations throughout the world will allow us to continue to develop and introduce new and improved products and enable us to compete effectively within this environment 
employees as of january   we had approximately  full time and part time employees of which approximately  were in the united states with the remainder serving at various international locations 
our domestic employees are not represented by collective bargaining groups 
we have had no significant difficulty attracting qualified professionals 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be very positive

factors that could affect future results because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
our failure to compete with other manufacturers in the highly competitive ivd industry  some of which have greater financial resources than we do  could harm our ability to retain existing customers and obtain future business 
the ivd industry is highly competitive and we encounter competition from several international manufacturers in both domestic and foreign markets 
some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater resources  financial and other  than we do 
moreover  we encounter different competitors in each of our key product lines and we cannot assure you that we will not encounter increased competition in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our profit margins and business approach may be adversely affected by potential healthcare reform 
substantially all of our sales are in the ivd industry 
healthcare reform and the growth of managed care organizations have been considerable forces in the ivd industry 
these forces continue to place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on the profit margins of our products 
such continuing changes in the united states healthcare market could also force us to alter our approach to selling  marketing  distributing and servicing our customer base 
in the united states and abroad  changes to government reimbursement policies could reduce the funding that healthcare service providers have available for ivd expenditures  which could have a material adverse impact on our sales and or profit margin 
changes in our business strategy or plans may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
if our business strategy or plans change  whether in response to changes in economic conditions or developments in the diagnostics industry  or otherwise  we may be required to expend significantly more resources than planned to develop and implement any new business strategy or plans 
the expense of such change could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to meet our covenant obligations under the credit facility  if the floating rate under the credit facility increases or if we are unable to obtain favorable financing upon the expiration of the credit facility  our operating results may be adversely affected 
in  we entered into a five year million revolving credit facility and a six year million term loan facility  which together with the revolving credit facility  we refer to as the credit facility 
the credit facility contains customary covenants  including financial covenants 
if we cannot meet these covenants  events of default would arise  which could result in payment of this indebtedness being accelerated 
we cannot assure that upon the expiration of the credit facility we will be able to obtain replacement financing to fund future seasonal borrowings and letters of credit  or that such replacement financing  if obtained  will be on terms equally favorable to us 
our substantial indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business to generate future cash flow 
our outstanding debt at december  was million 
we may also incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
our substantial indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes  increase the amount of interest expense that we have to pay  because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which  if interest rates increase  could result in higher interest expense  increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business or the industry in which we operate  or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations 
approximately of our sales and a significant portion of our earnings are attributable to operations conducted abroad 
the united states dollar value of sales and earnings of these operations varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
changes in certain exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal obligations on our united states dollar denominated debt 
our planned hedging of other currencies against the united states dollar may not adequately reduce exposure to currency exchange fluctuation 
we make significant investments in research and development  but there is no guarantee that any of these investments will ultimately result in a commercial product that will generate revenues 
our products require the integration of many component systems and processes including electromechanical  information systems  and biochemical reactions or assays 
each year we expend significant resources in trying to develop new products that incorporate these systems 
for the year ended december   we spent approximately million on research and development expenses 
notwithstanding these investments  we may be unable to successfully design or develop any or all of these components or to integrate them into viable commercial systems 
we might also encounter substantial delays in getting products to market in a timely fashion 
we are subject to various environmental and occupational health and safety laws and any violation of these laws could result in liability that could adversely affect us 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental  health and safety laws and regulations and are subject to liabilities and compliance costs associated with past and current handling  processing  storing and disposing of hazardous substances and wastes 
our operations are also subject to federal  state  local and foreign occupational health and safety laws and regulations 
this requires us to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations and manage environmental risks 
we are subject to regulation by various federal  state and foreign agencies  which requires us to comply with regulations in the manufacture of some of our products and violation of such regulations could adversely affect us 
some of our products and operations are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and various other federal and state agencies  as well as by a number of foreign governmental agencies 
fda regulations require that most of our new products have pre marketing approval by the fda  or prove substantial equivalence through a k application and also require that most of our products be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices 
our products and operations are also subject to regulation by the united states drug enforcement agency  or dea  and various other federal and state agencies  including the united states department of agriculture  or usda  as well as by a number of foreign governmental agencies 
dea regulations require that we obtain dea registrations for the bulk manufacture and handling of controlled substances  maintain effective controls against diversion  and use state of the art techniques in the manufacture of controlled substances 
the usda regulates the importation of animal sourced materials and the treatment and handling of animals utilized to derive biological materials used in research or production 
compliance with such regulations substantially increases the time  difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to manufacture and market newly developed and existing products 
in addition  government regulatory actions can result in the seizure or recall of products  suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions 
our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we own over  united states and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending in the united states and abroad 
we own numerous united states and foreign registered trademarks and service marks and have applications for the registration of trademarks and service marks pending in the united states and abroad 
we also own several united states copyright registrations 
in addition  we own a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how 
further  we license certain intellectual property rights from third parties 
our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property 
there can be no assurance as to the degree of protection offered by the various patents  the likelihood that patents will be issued on pending patent applications  or  with regard to the licensed intellectual property  that the licenses will not be terminated 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop around the patented aspects of any of our current or proposed products  independently develop technology or know how that is the same as or competitive with our technology and know how or otherwise obtain access to our intellectual property 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed products  our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected

we have recorded all incremental professional fees and other costs associated with the reorganization of our balance sheet incurred after the bankruptcy filing in this separate line item on our consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  on september   baxter healthcare corporation baxter filed objections to our plan of reorganization 
baxter objected to the adequacy of the disclosure statement filed with the bankruptcy court and to confirmation of the plan of reorganization on a number of bases 
on september   we agreed to settle all matters with baxter for million  such claim to be treated as a general unsecured claim under the plan of reorganization

adjustment adjusted item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the discussion below  we make comparisons on a constant currency basis  which is not a us gaap defined measure 
we believe this measure provides for a meaningful analysis of the underlying activity since it eliminates the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
when making comparisons on a constant currency basis  we have calculated the change by comparing the applicable reported current year amount to the corresponding amount from the prior year in local currency translated at the foreign currency exchange rates for the current year 
constant currency as defined or presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
results of operations we derive substantially all of our revenue from manufacturing and marketing ivd products and services 
we are organized functionally and have three reporting segments global customer management gcm north america  gcm international and global operations 
gcm north america and gcm international are our sales and service organizations 
for our reporting purposes  north america includes the united states and canada 
international includes sales and service results from all other countries 
the gross profit margin for the two gcm segments are not materially different 
global operations primarily includes all manufacturing and research and development activities  and accordingly does not recognize significant revenues 
global operations functions as a cost center  consequently a discussion of gross profit for each individual operating segment would not be meaningful 
generally  global operations does not incur a material amount of our marketing and administrative expense  but is responsible for virtually all research and development expense 
restructuring charges and certain other expenses  such as income taxes  general corporate expenses and financing costs  are not allocated to the operating segments 
bankruptcy proceedings on august   dade behring holdings  inc and certain of its wholly owned direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries dade behring inc  dade microscan inc  dade finance  inc  syva diagnostics holding co  syva childcare inc  syva company  and chimera research chemical  inc 
filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  as amended  with the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois 
we collectively refer to the companies party to the bankruptcy proceedings as the debtors 
on august   the debtors filed their disclosure statement for their joint chapter plan of reorganization  which we call the plan of reorganization 
no other subsidiaries of dade behring holdings  inc filed for relief under the united states bankruptcy code 
the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of reorganization on september  and the plan became effective on october  the plan of reorganization allowed the debtors to emerge from bankruptcy with an improved capital structure and  because the debtors were allowed to continue paying their trade debt on a timely basis during the pendency of the chapter cases  they had sufficient trade credit to continue their operations in the ordinary course of business 
on the effective date of the plan of reorganization  dade behring inc entered into new credit facilities 
see liquidity and capital resources credit facilities below for further discussion 
as a result of the plan of reorganization  significant changes resulted to our capital structure 
although the plan of reorganization became effective on october   for financial reporting convenience purposes  we recorded the adjustments necessitated by sop on october  as a result of our emergence from chapter bankruptcy and the application of fresh start reporting  our consolidated financial statements for the periods commencing on october  are referred to as the successor company and are not comparable with any periods prior to october   which are referred to as the predecessor company 
the effects of fresh start reporting and new accounting pronouncements see notes and to our consolidated financial statements resulted in a new basis of accounting for the predecessor company on october  all references to the period ended october  which represents the period from january  through october  and year ended december  are to the predecessor company 
all references to the year ended december  and period ended december  which represents the period from october  through december  are to the successor company 
the plan of reorganization and associated new senior credit agreement and capital structure provided for the following a restructuring of our debt occurred that reduced the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness by approximately million and converted that debt into equity 
this was accomplished by retiring existing senior debt and senior subordinated notes  issuing approximately  shares of new common stock  shares are currently authorized  and replacing the old debt with the new debt described below 
the new common stock was issued to the holders of existing senior debt  senior subordinated notes and management 
all preferred and common stock existing prior to the filing of the plan of reorganization  as well as all options  warrants  and rights to purchase or otherwise receive common stock existing prior to the filing of the plan of reorganization were cancelled 
management incentive plans were established that provided for issuing new common stock and granting new stock option awards to employees 
as of october   of our fully diluted new common equity consisting of  common shares was set aside for officers and certain other employees for the issuance of options and stock awards 
this was fully diluted after giving effect to the issuance of options and stock awards 
all stock awards provided for in the management incentive plans  totaling  shares  have been issued 
nearly all of the  option awards provided for in the management incentive plans have been issued 
see note  shareholders equity and redeemable preferred stock  for further information 
a special one time bonus pool of million will be payable upon a change in control of the company within five years of the effective date of the plan of reorganization 
such bonus pool shall be payable in cash upon such change of control to the chief executive officer  executive team and certain other employees 
the pool will be reduced but not below zero by the aggregate amount of any realized gain in the chief executive officer s  executive team s and certain other employees stock options awarded consistent with the terms thereof upon a change of control 
this pool has not been utilized during or a new senior revolving credit facility in the amount of million no borrowings outstanding at december  and a new senior term loan facility of million million outstanding at december  both of which include the ability to borrow in euros were established collectively the credit facility 
new senior subordinated notes of million were issued  which did not result in a cash infusion into the company 
during and  our term loan facility was amended 
see note  debt  for further discussion 
reorganization value is defined by sop as the fair value of the entity before considering liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after the restructuring 
our reorganization value was  million  which was less than the total postpetition liabilities and allowed claims of approximately  million 
as a result  we adopted fresh start reporting on october   as described earlier 
the reorganization value was derived by adding the fair value of all our liabilities million to our enterprise value  million 
the enterprise value can be defined as the total value of dade behring holdings  inc and our subsidiaries as a going concern ie the fair value of our assets  net of our liabilities excluding our bank debt and senior subordinated notes 
our enterprise value was determined based on consideration of many factors and by reliance on various valuation techniques  including comparable company analysis and two discounted cash flow analyses 
the factors considered included  but were not limited to  the following forecasted operating and cash flow results which gave effect to the estimated impact of the changes in our capital structure contemplated by the plan of reorganization  discounted cash flow analyses using an ebitda multiple or a perpetual growth rate to determine a terminal value  estimated values of our net operating loss carryforwards  consideration of market values of comparable companies  market share and position  and competition and general economic considerations 
successor company year ended december  compared to period ended december  the following discussion compares the operating results of the successor company for the year ended december  to the period from october  to december  throughout this discussion  all references to the period ended december  represent the period from october  to december  this discussion covers two periods of different lengths 
net sales 
net sales of the successor company for the year ended december  and the period ended december  totaled  million and million  respectively 
sales for each segment were as follows in millions year ended december  period ended december  gcm north america gcm international global operations total  the increase in sales of  million was driven primarily by the difference in the length of the periods twelve months of sales in versus approximately three months of sales in 
sales for the year ended december  by product line were as follows core chemistry products million  hemostasis products million  microbiology products million  infectious disease diagnostics products million  and mature products million 
sales for the period ended december  by product line were as follows core chemistry products million  hemostasis products million  microbiology products million  infectious disease diagnostics products million  and mature products million 
gross profit 
gross profit margins for the year ended december   were as compared to for the period ended december  approximately million of inventory step up under fresh start reporting  which was recognized as expense in the period ended december   negatively impacted margins for that period by 
the remaining improvement in margins was primarily due to favorable product mix  cost reduction initiatives at our manufacturing sites and favorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
operating costs and expenses 
marketing and administrative expenses for the year ended december   totaled million or of sales as compared to million or of sales for the period ended december  non cash charges of million and million  respectively  for stock based compensation expense relating to stock options issued and stock grants made to management negatively impacted marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by and for the year ended december  and the period ended december   respectively 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million or of sales as compared to million or of sales for the period ended december  income loss from operations 
income from operations for the year ended december  was million compared to a loss from operations of million for the period ended december  the increase in operating income is attributable primarily to the different lengths of the periods and the absence of fresh start reporting adjustments in interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the period ended december  the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the different lengths of the periods 
income tax expense 
income tax expense of million  representing an effective rate of  was recorded in the year ended december   as compared to an income tax benefit of million  which represents an effective rate of  in the period ended december  the recording of valuation allowances  the accrual for unremitted earnings  and income from non us sources negatively impacted the effective rate in the period ended december  net income 
net income was million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the period ended december  the increase in net income is primarily due to increased sales as a result of different period lengths  increased gross profit margin percentage  the absence of fresh start reporting adjustments in  and decreased marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
successor company year ended december  compared to combined year ended december  in order to provide a meaningful basis of comparing the years ended december  and  for purposes of the following discussion  the operating results of the successor company for the period ended december  which represents the period from october  through december  have been combined with the operating results of the predecessor company for the period ended october  which represents the period from january  through october   and are compared to the year ended december  the combining of successor and predecessor periods does not result in a presentation that is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  but we believe such results will provide meaningful comparisons for net sales  gross profit excluding the inventory step up impact under fresh start reporting  and operating costs and expenses 
changes to our capital structure and the adoption of fresh start reporting primarily affect depreciation  amortization and interest expenses 
year ended december  combined in millions net sales   gross profit operating costs and expenses marketing and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring expense  net cost reduction programs expense income from operations interest expense interest income other income balance sheet restructuring costs income loss before reorganization items  income tax and cumulative change in accounting principle reorganization items  income before income tax and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  income tax expense cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  totaled  million as compared to  million in the corresponding prior year period 
sales for each segment were as follows in millions year ended december  combined change gcm north america gcm international global operations total   adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes of million  sales increased million or for the year 
on a constant currency basis  sales increased million or in gcm north america  and million or across gcm international locations 
the increase on a constant currency basis can be primarily attributed to a million or increase in core chemistry sales primarily driven by dimension product sales globally  a million or increase in hemostasis product sales with the strongest growth in north america  a million or increase in microbiology product sales  partially offset by a million or decrease in infectious disease product sales and million or decrease in sales of mature products across all segments 
we define mature products as those products and services that we do not consider to be part of our core strategy and as a result  they are expected to have declining sales over time 
our worldwide installed base of instruments  an important indicator of future growth potential  grew during the year ended december  the installed base growth for the year is attributable to a increase in the strategic installed base  which consists of those instruments that represent current versions of our instrument offerings and are the focus of most of our sales and marketing efforts 
the growth in the strategic base was partially offset by a decline in the non strategic base 
to provide more visibility to the growth dynamics of our instrument base  we adjusted our december  non strategic installed base statistic to remove mature product line instruments  including aca and opus  which are being phased out of our product portfolio over the next two years  and other older non strategic instruments 
the revised installed base of instruments as of december   using the new calculation methodology  was approximately  growth in the installed base of dimension rxl and dimension xpand instruments as well as the bn prospec plasma protein instrument have driven much of the sales growth seen in our core chemistry products 
gains in the hemostasis installed base have been driven by successes in ca  ca  bcs and pfa instrument placements 
for microbiology  new installations of our autoscan and walkaway series of instruments continue to provide growth while the bep iii and bep instruments have been the primary contributors of installed base growth for the infectious disease product line 
however  migration in the hospital laboratory from microtiter plate testing to immunoassay instruments has caused an overall decline in idd sales 
improved method penetration  which results from utilizing an existing instrument base for additional tests  combined with the growth in sales of higher priced specialty tests  have further contributed to our sales growth 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million to million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in the corresponding prior year period 
gross profit in was negatively impacted by a million inventory step up under fresh start reporting and approximately million related to the write off of excess inventory and reductions in production volumes during the bankruptcy proceedings 
these items  on a constant currency basis  negatively impacted the gross profit margin for by 
excluding the inventory step up impact  foreign currency changes positively impacted margins by  while manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives at our manufacturing sites  and changes in product mix had a positive impact of 
partially offsetting these items  higher depreciation and amortization charges related to the implementation of fresh start reporting negatively impacted margins by 
marketing and administrative expenses 
marketing and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in the corresponding prior year period 
marketing and administrative expenses increased million related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  million related to higher non cash stock based compensation charges million in compared to million in  and approximately million related to incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the adoption of fresh start reporting 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  totaled million of sales and was higher than the corresponding prior year period 
on a constant currency basis  research and development expense increased million or over the corresponding prior year period 
we expect spending to remain at of sales and to continue to exceed prior year levels as we increase investments in new product development  such as the high volume dimension vista instrument and new assays for all product lines 
income from operations 
income from operations for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million in the corresponding prior year period 
the increase in income from operations for the year ended december  is due primarily to the impacts of increased sales and gross profit  partially offset by increased research and development spending and higher marketing and administrative expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million  a million reduction over the corresponding prior year period 
the decrease is primarily due to lower debt levels as a result of the debt restructuring in and million of debt payments in balance sheet restructuring costs 
balance sheet restructuring costs represent all incremental professional and bank fees associated with the reorganization of our balance sheet incurred prior to the bankruptcy filing on august  balance sheet restructuring costs for the year ended december  were million 
after august   these costs were classified as reorganization costs 
no such costs were incurred in and none are expected in the future 
reorganization items 
reorganization items include gains from extinguishment of debt under the plan of reorganization million and fresh start adjustments million  partially offset by reorganization costs million 
reorganization costs represent all costs associated with the reorganization of our balance sheet incurred after the bankruptcy filing on august  this includes professional fees of million and a million settlement with baxter healthcare corporation  as described in the reorganization costs section of note to our financial statements 
no such costs were incurred in and none are expected in the future 
income tax expense 
income tax expense of million  representing an effective rate of  was recorded in the year ended december   as compared to million  representing an effective tax rate of  in the corresponding prior year period 
the recording of valuation allowances had a negative impact on the effective tax rate for the year ended december  the impact due to the recording of valuation allowances for the year ended december  was minimal 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we wrote off negative goodwill and recognized a million gain as of january  net income 
the net income for the year ended december  was million as compared to  million in the corresponding prior year period  a decrease of  million 
excluding the impact of the inventory step up under fresh start reporting  reorganization items  balance sheet restructuring costs and the gain recognized in the first quarter of associated with the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net income increased million 
the increase was primarily due to higher income from operations and lower interest expense  partially offset by higher income tax expense

net sales of the predecessor company for the period ended october   and the year ended december  totaled million and  million respectively 
sales for each segment were as follows in millions period ended october  year ended december  gcm north america gcm international global operations total  the decline in sales of million is driven primarily by the difference in the length of the periods approximately nine months of sales in versus twelve months of sales in and the sale of our baxter pump services and swiss immunohematology businesses in sales for the period ended october   by product line were as follows core chemistry products million  hemostasis products million  microbiology products million  infectious disease diagnostics products million  and mature products million

gross profit margins for the period ended october   were as compared to for the year ended december  the decline in margins was attributable primarily to increases in depreciation expense as a consequence of assets acquired in a bargain purchase transaction being replaced by new investment and inventory write offs associated with our drug testing product line 
operating costs and expenses 
marketing and administrative expense for the period ended october   totaled million or of sales as compared to million or of sales for the year ended december  research and development expense for the period ended october   totaled million or of sales as compared to million or of sales for the prior year ended december  we expect research and development spending to continue to increase as a percentage of sales as we invest in new product development  such as the high volume dimension vista instrument and new assays for all product lines 
cost reduction programs expense 
in connection with cost reduction programs previously initiated  we recognized million of expenses during the period ended october  that did not qualify for treatment as exit costs under emerging issues task force issue no 
see also note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
we recognized million of these expenses during the year ended december  restructuring expense 
we recognized million of net restructuring reserve reversals during the period ended october  compared to million of restructuring expense in these amounts related to an extension of the cost reduction programs approved in and income from operations 
income from operations for the period ended october  was million compared to million for the prior year 
however  as a percent of sales  income from operations rose to in the period ended october  from for the prior year 
the improvement in operating income margins is attributable primarily to less expense associated with cost reduction programs across all segments and the cessation of goodwill amortization in interest expense 
interest expense for the period ended october  totaled million  as compared to the full year interest expense of million in the prior year 
as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings  we were required to not record interest expense of million on our pre bankruptcy senior subordinated notes after august  balance sheet restructuring costs 
balance sheet restructuring costs represent all incremental professional and bank fees associated with the reorganization of our balance sheet incurred prior to the bankruptcy filing on august  balance sheet restructuring costs for the period ended october  were million as compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is due to these costs being classified as reorganization costs after august  we do not expect to incur any additional balance sheet restructuring costs in the future 
reorganization items 
reorganization items include gains from extinguishment of debt under the plan of reorganization million and fresh start adjustments million  offset by reorganization costs million 
reorganization costs represent all costs associated with the reorganization of our balance sheet incurred after the bankruptcy filing on august  this includes professional fees of million and a million settlement with baxter healthcare corporation  as described in the reorganization costs section of note to our financial statements 
income tax expense 
an income tax expense of million  representing an effective rate of  was recorded in the period ended october   as compared to million  which represents an effective tax rate of  in the year ended december  excluding the gains from extinguishment of debt and fresh start adjustments  the effective rate for the period ending october  was 
the negative effective tax rates are attributable to the recording of valuation allowances related to changes in assumptions with respect to deferred tax assets primarily in the united states  and the existence of foreign taxable income 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we wrote off negative goodwill and recognized a million gain as of january  net income loss 
the net income for the period ended october  was  million as compared to a net loss of million in the prior year ended december  combined year ended december  compared to year ended december  in order to provide a meaningful basis of comparing the years ended december  and  for purposes of the following tables and discussion  the operating results of the successor company for the period ended december  which represents the period from october  through december  have been combined with the operating results of the predecessor company for the period ended october  which represents the period from january  through october   and are compared to the year ended december  the combining of successor and predecessor periods does not result in a presentation that is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  but we believe such results will provide meaningful comparisons for net sales  gross profit excluding the inventory step up impact under fresh start reporting  and operating costs and expenses

net sales for the year ended december  totaled  million as compared to  million in the corresponding prior year period 
sales for each segment were as follows in millions year ended december  december  change gcm north america gcm international global operations total   during  our us baxter pump services and swiss immunohematology businesses were sold 
these businesses generated an aggregate of million of sales in the prior year period 
adjusting for the adverse impact of sold businesses and the favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes of million on results  sales increased million or for the year 
on an adjusted basis  sales increased million or in north america  and million or across international locations 
the increase on an adjusted basis can be primarily attributed to a million or increase in core chemistry sales primarily driven by dimension product sales globally  a million or increase in hemostasis product sales with the strongest growth in north america  a million or increase in microbiology product sales on strong performance in all geographies  a million or increase in infectious disease product sales  partially offset by a million or decrease in sales of mature products across all segments 
we consider mature products those products in the later stages of their life cycle which is determined as a function of research and development investment decisions and planning regarding the release of new product technology versions and third party products and services that we do not consider to be part of our core strategy and as a result  they are expected to have declining sales over time 
our worldwide installed base of instruments  an important indicator of future growth potential  grew during the year ended december  growth in the installed base of dimension xpand  which was introduced in  and dimension rxl instruments has driven much of the sales growth seen in our dimension products 
instrument placement growth has also occurred in our other product lines  with placements of the ca hemostasis instrument being the largest contributor 
improved method penetration  which results from utilizing an existing instrument base for additional tests  combined with the growth in higher priced  specialty reagents  have further contributed to our sales growth 
we believe that these trends will continue  which should in turn drive continued increases in overall sales 
to provide more visibility to the growth dynamics of our instrument base  we adjusted our december  installed base statistic to remove mature product line instruments  including aca and opus  which are being phased out of our product portfolio over the next two years  and other older non strategic instruments 
the installed base of instruments for and were not adjusted and are not comparable to the adjusted base 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased million to million as compared to million in the corresponding prior year period 
the decrease is attributable primarily to approximately million of inventory step up under fresh start reporting being recognized as expense in the fourth quarter of gross profit margins for the year ended december  were as compared to in the corresponding prior year period 
the expense associated with the above mentioned million of inventory step up accounted for percentage points of decline 
inventory write offs and the negative impact on manufacturing costs of lowering production volumes during the bankruptcy proceedings accounted for an additional percentage point decline 
increases in depreciation expense as a consequence of new investments being made to replace assets acquired in a bargain purchase transaction and the incremental depreciation and amortization expense related to fresh start reporting changes reduced margins further by percentage points 
excluding the one time impacts of fresh start reporting and inventory adjustments  gross profit margins for the year would have been 
marketing and administrative expense 
marketing and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased million to million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in the prior year period 
on a constant currency basis  marketing and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million 
during the fourth quarter  million of non cash stock compensation expense was recognized relating to stock grants to management 
excluding this item  marketing and administrative expense increased million and represented of sales 
on a constant currency basis  the remaining million increase was related to incremental sales  marketing and administrative costs incurred to help sustain our customer relationships as well as to effectively communicate the chapter filing  and incremental amortization associated with fresh start reporting  offset by cost reduction initiatives 
research and development expense 
research and development expense for the year ended december  totaled million of sales and was higher than the prior year 
on a constant currency basis  research and development expense increased over the corresponding prior year period 
we expect spending to continue to increase over prior year levels as savings from cost reduction initiatives are invested in new product development  such as the high volume dimension vista instrument and new assays for all product lines 
cost reduction programs expense 
in connection with cost reduction programs previously initiated  we recognized million of expenses during the year ended december  that did not qualify for treatment as exit costs under emerging issues task force issue no 
see also note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
we recognized million of these expenses during the year ended december  restructuring expense 
we recognized million of net restructuring reserve reversals during the year ended december  compared to million of restructuring expense in the prior year 
these amounts related to an extension of the cost reduction programs approved in and income from operations 
income from operations for the year ended december  decreased million to million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in income from operations for the year ended december  is due primarily to the impacts of the inventory step up  non cash stock compensation expense  research and development spending  and increases in marketing and administrative expense  partially offset by increased sales and less expense associated with cost reduction programs across all segments and the cessation of goodwill amortization 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million  a million reduction over the corresponding prior year period 
these changes are primarily due to lower interest rates and borrowing levels  mostly due to the reorganization 
as a result of the plan of reorganization  our total debt was reduced by million on october  per sop  once bankruptcy proceedings began  we were required to stop recording interest expense of million on our pre bankruptcy senior subordinated notes after august  balance sheet restructuring costs 
balance sheet restructuring costs represent all incremental professional and bank fees associated with the reorganization of our balance sheet incurred prior to the bankruptcy filing on august  balance sheet restructuring costs for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the prior year 
after august   these costs were classified as reorganization costs 
we do not expect to incur any additional balance sheet restructuring costs in the future 
reorganization items 
reorganization items include gains from extinguishment of debt under the plan of reorganization million and fresh start adjustments million  offset by reorganization costs million 
reorganization costs represent all costs associated with the reorganization of our balance sheet incurred after the bankruptcy filing on august  this includes professional fees of million and a million settlement with baxter healthcare corporation  as described in the reorganization costs section of note to our financial statements 
the increase in balance sheet restructuring and reorganization costs is attributable primarily to legal and advisory fees paid to external parties and other costs related to the bankruptcy filing  as well as the settlement with baxter healthcare corporation 
we do not expect to incur any additional reorganization items in the future 
income tax expense 
income tax expense of million  representing an effective rate of  was recorded in the year ended december   as compared to million  representing an effective tax rate of  in the year ended december  excluding the gains from extinguishment of debt and fresh start adjustments  the effective rate for was 
the negative effective tax rates are attributable to the recording of valuation allowances and the existence of foreign taxable income 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we wrote off negative goodwill and recognized a million gain as of january  net income loss 
the net income for the year ended december  was  million as compared to a net loss of million in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
in order to provide a meaningful basis of comparing the years ended december  and  for purposes of the following discussion  the cash flows of the successor company for the period ended december  which represents the period from october  through december  have been combined with the cash flows of the predecessor company for the period ended october  which represents the period from january  through october  and are compared to the year ended december  the combining of successor and predecessor periods does not result in a presentation that is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a discussion of the separate cash flows for the successor company and predecessor company is also included below 
however  for the successor company  no comparable length prior period exists  and predecessor company comparisons of the period ended october  to the year ended december  may not be meaningful as the periods differ in length 
for the year ended december  and the period ended december   operating activities of the successor company provided cash of million and million  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the different period lengths 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for the year ended december  the change was primarily due to increased income from operations  and lower interest payments and balance sheet restructuring and reorganization costs 
in certain countries where the collection process is lengthy  we utilize factoring facilities under which certain foreign trade receivables are sold on a non recourse basis to financial institutions at face value 
on a constant currency basis  our factoring utilization increased by million to million for the year ended december  we made pension plan funding payments in the us of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we are currently estimating funding payments in the us to be approximately million 
net cash flow used for investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the period ended december  for the successor company 
the increase in net cash used is primarily attributable to higher capital expenditures due to the different period lengths 
net cash flow used for investing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and is primarily for capital expenditures 
the increases in capital expenditures is due primarily to an increase in the placement of instruments at customers in exchange for contractual commitments for ongoing reagent revenues  higher spending for research and development projects and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
successor company financing activities for the year ended december  and the period ended december  used net cash of million and million  respectively  as net debt levels were reduced 
increases in net cash provided by operations has allowed us to make higher debt repayments 
we will continue to use cash generated by operations to reduce our overall debt level 
financing activities for the year ended december  used net cash of million  versus million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used was primarily due to million of debt payments in  of which million were prepayments of our bank term loans 
we made additional bank debt prepayments totaling million during january and february partially offsetting the increase in net cash used for financing activities were proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan of million during in january  we initiated a redemption program for our senior subordinated notes 
under this program  net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan can be used to redeem our bonds 
the bonds can be redeemed at par plus of the face value  plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date 
in january  we redeemed million of our bonds and we redeemed an additional million during february this program is expected to continue throughout credit facilities 
we entered into the credit facility on october  as of december   the credit facility consisted of a million year term loan facility  an million year term loan facility  and a million year multi currency revolving credit facility 
at december   our borrowings under the term loan facility bore interest at an effective average rate of 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a discussion about our interest rate hedging activity 
we had letters of credit outstanding of million  which reduced our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december  in september  certain of our subsidiaries in germany entered into a revolving credit facility for million expiring in july the dresdner facility 
borrowings under the dresdner facility are subject to a variable interest rate of the european overnight indexed average plus 
under the terms of the dresdner facility  up to million can be utilized in the forms of cash or guarantees  and the remainder can be used as credit lines for derivatives trading and settlement risks 
as of december   the interest rate was and million was utilized for guarantee purposes  which reduced our available borrowings under this facility 
in addition  a number of subsidiary companies outside the us have credit facilities to meet their liquidity requirements 
as of december   the borrowing capacity under these facilities totaled million 
at december   million in borrowings and million in letters of credit were outstanding under these credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements 
certain terms of the credit facility were amended in october the second amendment  which resulted in an immediate reduction in the annual cost of borrowing under the dollar denominated term loans by 
the interest rate on us dollar denominated borrowing  which accounts for approximately of the term loan facility  was reduced to a base rate as defined in the credit facility plus or libor plus 
the interest rate on euro denominated borrowing remains the same at euribor plus 
the second amendment continues to provide for a step down to lower interest rates if we obtain a ratings improvement 
the second amendment contains revisions to certain financial covenants to eliminate a cash sweep requirement if our leverage ratio is better than and allows higher capital expenditures throughout the remaining life of the term loan facility 
the second amendment also allows for the redemption of up to of the senior subordinated notes with net cash proceeds from qualified equity offerings 
in addition  it allows us to make up to million of open market purchases of the senior subordinated notes 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for discussion about our interest rate hedging activity 
the credit facility was again amended in december the third amendment 
the third amendment allows us to redeem outstanding senior subordinated notes with the net cash proceeds from equity offerings or the issuance of our common stock  or options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock  to any employee  officer or director of our company or any of our subsidiaries 
in accordance with the terms of the credit facility  in we made approximately million of voluntary prepayments of required amortization payments originally due through june additional prepayments totaling million were made in january and february senior subordinated notes 
at december   we had senior subordinated notes due outstanding in the principal amount of million  with a coupon rate of 
the obligations under the senior subordinated notes are senior to all of dade behring inc s subordinated unsecured obligations and subordinate to the credit facility 
subsequent to the third amendment to the credit facility as described above  we redeemed million in principal amount of the notes in january we also redeemed million in principal amount in february the aggregate outstanding principal amount of notes outstanding after these redemptions is million 
we expect to initiate additional redemptions throughout future capital needs 
we are still significantly leveraged and our ability to meet our debt obligations will depend upon future operating performance which will be affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we believe our existing credit facilities  in conjunction with anticipated positive operating cash flows  will provide adequate liquidity to meet obligations  fund capital expenditures and invest in potential growth opportunities 
if  however  we are unable to service our debt requirements as they become due or are unable to maintain ongoing compliance with restrictive covenants  we may be forced to adopt alternative strategies that may include reducing or delaying capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital 
there can be no assurances that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
contractual cash obligations projected payments and estimated interest expense are as shown below expected payments due by period total after short term and long term debt interest on long term debt revolving credit line fees on revolving credit line operating leases foreign borrowing arrangements capital lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations  as discussed above  we made prepayments on our term loans totaling million in january and february we also redeemed million in principal amount of our senior subordinated notes in january and february purchase obligations primarily consist of supply agreements with vendors for the purchase of specified levels of goods or services over the respective contract periods 
off balance sheet arrangements except as noted in the table above  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that  in management s view  are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our most critical accounting policies note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  reserves for doubtful accounts  adjustments for write down of inventories to net realizable value  pension plan assumptions  and tax valuation allowances 
we use a combination of historical results and anticipated future events to estimate and make assumptions relating to our critical accounting policies 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
see also note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we manufacture and market a broad offering of ivd products and services which currently include medical diagnostic instruments  reagents and consumables  and maintenance services 
reagents and consumables represent approximately of our sales  while instruments account for approximately of our sales and maintenance services account for the remainder 
reagents and consumables includes revenue from instrument rentals included in customer contracts where equipment is placed with end customers in exchange for contractual commitments for ongoing reagent revenues 
instruments are mostly sold either directly to the customer or to a third party financing entity that in turn leases it to the end customer  or we may enter into sales type leases with the customer 
sales type leases have historically not been significant  representing less than of revenues  but are expected to grow over time 
instrument revenue is recognized when risk of loss transfers 
we sell most of our products and services under bundled contract arrangements  which contain multiple deliverable elements 
under these arrangements  an instrument placement is accompanied by a customer commitment to purchase minimum volumes of reagents and consumables  at a pre determined price over the contract period  which is generally sixty months 
additionally  these arrangements include a customer commitment to purchase maintenance services which covers the first year of the contract term 
additional years of service may be purchased through these arrangements or purchased separately 
revenues under these bundled arrangements are allocated among the contract s constituent elements principally instruments  reagents  consumables and service based upon the estimated fair value of each element as determined by reference to verifiable objective evidence 
our principal point of reference in making this determination is the amount of revenue we realize when our products and services are sold in stand alone transactions 
reagent and consumables revenue is recognized over the term of the contract as they are purchased by  and delivered to  the customer 
additionally  some customer contracts result in equipment being placed with end customers in exchange for contractual commitments for ongoing reagent revenues  typically over a five year term 
in these situations  title does not pass to the customer and no revenue on equipment placement is recognized  rather the cost of this equipment is carried on our balance sheet and amortized to cost of sales over the useful life of the equipment  which is generally five years 
revenue under product service contracts  which are generally for one year or less  is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
reserves for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and payment accommodations made to our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
adjustments for write down of inventories to net realizable value 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost based on the first in  first out method or market 
market for raw materials is based on replacement costs and  for other inventory classifications  on net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for deterioration  excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next months 
several factors may influence the realizability of our inventories  including technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we will be required to recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
pension plan assumptions 
we maintain non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees in the united states and puerto rico and a combination of contributory and non contributory plans in certain non us locations 
benefits under the united states plans are based on a cash balance formula 
our funding policy is to make contributions to the trusts of the plans that meet or exceed the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act of in an attempt to anticipate future events  several statistical and other factors are used in calculating the expense  liability and resulting funding requirements related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions we make about  among other things  the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases and withdrawal and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense we have recorded or may record  and our cash funding requirements 
during  our assumption for the discount rate was  but is estimated at for as of december   our assumption for expected return on pension plan assets was  and is not expected to change for these and other assumptions impacting pension expense could change in the future based on various factors  including  but not limited to  market conditions  asset allocations  and workforce composition 
for  our net periodic benefit cost for our us based plans was approximately million  which is approximately million less than the cost for we expect that the costs will be relatively consistent with  however  changes in interest rates and market gains or losses could significantly impact post pension expense and additional funding requirements 
tax valuation allowances 
we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances if we believe more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset is not recoverable 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we consider all currently available data  our historical taxable earnings and losses by jurisdiction  current financial condition  forecast for future taxable earnings and losses by jurisdiction and other relevant factors 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our remaining net deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results

tax credits and loss carryforwards realization of cancellation of indebtedness income 
subject to certain exceptions  a debtor generally recognizes an amount of cancellation of debt cod income upon satisfaction of its outstanding indebtedness equal to the excess of the adjusted issue price of the indebtedness satisfied over the sum of the issue price of any new indebtedness issued  the amount of cash paid and the fair market value of any other consideration  including stock of the debtor  given in satisfaction of the indebtedness 
as discussed below  there is a bankruptcy exception to the recognition of cod income which applies to us in connection with the reorganization 
a debtor is not required to include cod income in gross income if the debt discharge occurs in a title case 
however  under the internal revenue code of  as amended  the tax code the debtor must  as of the first day of the next taxable year  reduce its tax attributes in general  first its nol carryovers and then tax credits and capital loss carryovers and then the tax basis of its assets by the amount of cod income excluded from gross income by this exception 
as an exception to the order of tax attribute reduction described above  a taxpayer can elect to reduce its tax basis in its depreciable assets first  then its nol carryovers and then its tax credits and capital loss carryovers 
since the cod income was realized in a title case  we are not required to include the cod income in taxable income  but are required to reduce our us nol carryovers by the amount of the cod income 
our us nol carryover as of december  is million after the amount of cod income realized as a result of the reorganization 
section limitation on nol carryovers and other tax attributes 
as a result of the consummation of the reorganization  we underwent an ownership change within the meaning of section of the tax code 
as a consequence  after the reorganization  we are subject to limitation on the use of any us nol carryover incurred prior to the ownership change 
under special provisions of section of the tax code applicable to companies in bankruptcy  the limitation is equal to the product of the lesser of x the value of the equity of the reorganized debtors immediately after the ownership change and y the value of the consolidated gross assets immediately before such change  with certain adjustments and the long term tax exempt rate in effect for the month of the effective date of the reorganization as published in the internal revenue bulletin of the united states treasury department 
we elected not to apply the general us nol limitation applicable to companies in bankruptcy since application of that rule would result in less favorable treatment than that described above 
if a corporation that undergoes an ownership change has a net unrealized built in loss  subject to certain limitations  any recognized built in loss during the five year period beginning with the date of the ownership change  referred to as the recognition period  is generally treated as a pre change loss and is subject to the section limitation described above 
if the corporation has a net unrealized built in gain  subject to certain limitations  the section limitation for any taxable year within the recognition period will be increased by the recognized built in gain for such taxable year 
a net unrealized built in gain or net unrealized built in loss exists to the extent the fair market value of the corporation s assets is more or less  respectively  than the aggregate adjusted tax basis of its assets immediately before the ownership change  provided the resulting net unrealized built in gain or net unrealized built in loss is greater than the lesser of of the fair market value of the corporation s assets and million 
under current irs administrative policy  the amount of the cod income recognized upon an ownership change is treated as an item of income attributable to the pre change period under section h of the tax code and such cod income is added to the gross fair market value of the corporation s assets in determining whether the loss corporation has a net unrealized built in loss 
any unused section limitation in a given year may be carried forward  thereby increasing the section limitation in the subsequent taxable year 
however  if the corporation or consolidated group does not continue its historic business or use a significant portion of its assets in a new business for two years after the ownership change  the section limitation resulting from the ownership change will be zero 
alternative minimum tax 
a corporation must pay an alternative minimum tax  or amt  equal to of its alternative minimum taxable income  or amti  reduced by certain credits allowable for amt purposes  to the extent that the amt exceeds the tax of the corporation calculated at the normal progressive income tax rates 
in calculating the amti  a corporation s income and losses are subject to various adjustments 
for example  in computing amti  a corporation s nols are adjusted for the adjustments and preferences under the amt sections of the tax code and such resulting nols can be utilized to offset only of the corporation s amti for nols generated or taken as carryforwards in taxable years ending in or 
however  cod income that is excluded from taxable income under the rules discussed above under realization of cancellation of indebtedness income similarly is excluded from amti 
as a result of limitations on the use of our nols and the reduced annual amount of depreciation used in calculating amti  it is possible that we may be required to pay amt even though we may not otherwise be required to pay regular federal income tax

we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
the qualitative and quantitative information presented below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments outstanding at december  fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices 
the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
no material changes in our market risk have occurred since december  interest rate risk 
we use interest rate swap agreements to effectively limit exposure to interest rate movements within the parameters of our interest rate hedging policy 
these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 and as such  as long as the hedge is effective and the underlying transaction is probable  the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these contracts is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until earnings are affected by the cash flows being hedged 
the fair value of our interest rate derivative agreements is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements  assuming prevailing interest rates 
at december   million of our term debt was hedged using interest rate swap agreements  which resulted in an average effective rate of 
a sensitivity analysis to measure the potential impact that a change in interest rates would have on our net income indicates that a adverse change in interest rates would increase our interest expense by approximately million based on december  debt positions 
the table below provides information as of december  about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  which includes the interest rate swap agreements and our long term debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for the interest rate swap agreements  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value amounts in millions long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate swaps variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate foreign currency risk 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to primarily hedge foreign currency transactional exposures 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregated notional amount of million 
at december   the fair value of outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts was a liability of million 
gains and losses on forward contracts resulting from revaluations are recorded to foreign exchange gain loss and substantially offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in current earnings 
to manage the foreign currency risk on our foreign currency sales outside of the united states  in  we purchased out of the money average rate put options for the euro and japanese yen with characteristics similar to those of our underlying exposure to manage this foreign currency exposure 
the intrinsic value of the average rate put options is designated as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and as such  as long as the hedge is effective and the underlying transaction is probable  the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these contracts is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the cash flows being hedged 
at december   we held average rate put options with aggregated notional amounts of approximately million 
at december   the fair value of outstanding foreign currency option contracts aggregated a million asset 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative use of financial instruments 
derivative losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are a result of qualifying hedging activity 
a sensitivity analysis to measure the potential impact that a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the company s net income indicates that a adverse change in currency exchange rates would lead to gains losses of approximately million on foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  such gains losses would be substantially offset by losses gains from the revaluation or settlement of the underlying positions hedged
