in may  we converted from a limited liability corporation and completed our initial public offering 
in recent years  we have been operating in a challenging business  economic and regulatory environment 
over the past two years  we have experienced losses  with a net loss of million for the year ended including a restructuring charge of million and a write down of intangible assets of million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended including a restructuring charge of million and a write down of intangible assets of million 
our revenues remained level as higher share volumes traded were offset by lower revenue per share  as well as decreases in revenue from non us equities  investments and interest 
in and  we implemented a series of cost reduction plans that reduced annual operating costs from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter by approximately million on an annualized basis 
we are currently implementing further cost reductions that target a reduction in operating costs of approximately million on an annualized basis by the end of strategic developments since the fourth quarter of  we have been implementing a business restructuring plan to establish two distinct business lines instinet  the institutional broker sm  which serves our us and international institutional customers including customers of lynch  jones ryan  our commission recapture subsidiary 
inet sm formerly known as island ecn  our ecn that combines the us broker dealer order flow of the instinet ecn and the island ecn and serves our us broker dealer customers 
inet also includes our clearing broker  instinet clearing services  inc upon the completion of the business restructuring  we currently anticipate that we will provide separate financial disclosures for the instinet and inet as established by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information for the first quarter of this reorganization was substantially completed on february  in september  we acquired island holding company  inc  the parent company of the island ecn  inc  a leading electronic securities marketplace  and paid a per common stock cash dividend  which represented a distribution of approximately million 
business environment and key business drivers our business is impacted by several main factors trading volumes in us securities markets  consideration value of transactions traded internationally and the competitive environment within the brokerage business 
trading volumes are affected by many factors  including investor confidence  stock price performance  global economic growth and political stability  and the level of corporate activity  including capital raising 
international consideration levels  as a multiple of trading volumes and stock price  are also affected by these factors 
our overall competitive environment  which is reflected in our market share of overall trading volume and the prices that we are able to charge our customers  is shaped in part by the level of market trading activity  but also by the abundance of competitors  continuing advances in technology  ongoing regulatory developments  increased customer awareness and regulatory scrutiny of execution costs and continuing unbundling of financial services 
in addition  the securities markets and the brokerage industry in which we operate are highly regulated  and these regulations may limit or shape our activities 
these factors all affect our future revenues as well as our ability to achieve our strategic objectives 
a key measure of trading volume in the us securities markets is average daily trading volume 
while average daily trading volume in the us equity markets as a whole has continued to show moderate growth since  the market in which we trade a significant portion of our volume  nasdaq  has experienced a decline since average daily trading volume in nasdaq listed stocks was down for the full year  however  during the last half of  volume increased and was maintained at a higher level than average daily trading volume in us exchange listed stocks has grown steadily over the past five years  although the growth rate has slowed since our market share  both in nasdaq listed and us exchange listed stocks  has increased significantly  particularly in  primarily as a result of our acquisition of island in september within  however  our nasdaq market share has fluctuated  and it had declined significantly at the end of and into the following charts illustrate the trend of us equity trading volume and our market share of this volume over the past five years logo logo the volatility in our market share reflects the intense competitive environment within the brokerage business 
as a result of this competition  we have decreased our prices significantly since in september  we implemented a new pricing schedule for our us broker dealer customers and adjusted certain pre set volume levels at which we offer those customers lower per share transaction fees 
in march  we offered further pricing incentives to our us broker dealer customers  reducing prices paid by broker dealers trading listed stocks by approximately and simplifying the pricing schedule by further adjusting certain pre set volume levels 
in october  we reduced price for routing orders in nasdaq listed stocks to other trading venues through our smart order routing by 
additionally  the average net revenue capture per share from our institutional customers declined from in compare to following these changes in pricing  our average us equity transaction fee revenue per share  per side has declined to in from in  which in turn was a decrease from in this decline also reflects a shift in our business mix towards our lower priced broker dealer customers 
net of the impact of soft dollar and commission recapture revenues and broker dealer rebates  our average transaction fee revenue for us equities per share  per side a non gaap measure has decreased to in from in and in we will continue to monitor future price competition and evaluate our pricing structure as part of our ongoing efforts to maintain and expand inet s liquidity pool 
as a result of these changes in pricing and business mix  our transaction fee revenue from us equities increased only in to million from million in  and represented a decline from billion in  despite the substantial increases in our trading volumes that in were primarily due to our acquisition of island 
overall  our customers traded billion us equity shares with us in  representing an increase of over billion in  which in turn represented a increase over billion in of that amount  nasdaq listed equity shares comprised billion in  billion in and billion in  also reflecting a steady increase  while our us exchange listed share volume rose to billion in and billion in from billion in the following graph depicts our us equity share volumes and our us equity transaction fee revenues  on a quarterly basis from to logo outside the united states  where our revenues from international transactions are determined on the basis of market consideration rather than the number of shares traded  average daily market consideration increased to billion in from billion in  primarily reflecting both higher trading volumes and a recovery in stock prices  as well as the impact of a decline in value of the us dollar 
however  our average daily consideration traded declined to million in from million in  primarily as a result of lower volumes of trading due to our decreased focus on lower margin clients in our pricing for non us equity trading remained largely unchanged at an average of basis points of consideration traded in both and  reflecting a shift in our volume away from lower margin clients offset by an overall decline in pricing 
as a result of the lower average daily consideration traded our net transaction fees from non us equities declined in to million from million in transactions fees in declined from million in primarily due to price reductions 
also in response to the intense competitive environment in the united states and our resulting pricing reduction actions  we began a series of cost cutting efforts in that have continued through in connection with these cost cutting efforts  which primarily involved headcount reductions and office closures  we recorded restructuring charges of million and million of severance costs in  and restructuring charges of million and million in and  respectively 
our expenses have declined as a result of these cost cutting efforts  to billion in from billion in and billion before the acquisition of island in these expense figures also include the restructuring charges and expenses mentioned above  as well as charges for the impairment of intangible assets of million in and million in  and net insurance recoveries from the loss of fixed assets at the world trade center of million in and million in in addition to these expenses  we recorded an million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in when we adopted sfas no 
and incurred losses of million in and million in related to our fixed income operations  which we closed in as a result of the cost reduction efforts  total expenses  excluding the above items and broker dealer rebates and soft dollar and commission recapture  declined to million in from in and million in non gaap financial measurement in evaluating our financial performance and results of operations  management reviews certain financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in the united states non gaap 
non gaap measurements do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
management uses non gaap financial measures in evaluating our operating performance 
in light of the use by management of these non gaap measurements to assess our operational performance  we believe it is useful to provide information with respect to these non gaap measurements so as to share this perspective of management 
these non gaap financial measures should be considered in the context with our gaap results 
our transaction fees earned from our customers trading equity securities have represented  and continue to represent  a substantial portion of our revenues 
gaap requires us to add our soft dollar and commission recapture expenses and broker dealer rebates  dollar for dollar  to related equity transaction fee revenues  which has a dilutive effect on our operating margins 
therefore  when evaluating our revenues from equity transactions  management reviews our net equity transaction fee revenue  based on us securities and us securities 
our net equity transaction fee revenues are calculated by subtracting the soft dollar and commission recapture expenses as well as broker dealer rebates from the related equity transaction fees  as well as non equity related revenues  and is calculated as follows year ended december  in thousands  except revenue capture per share total revenue transaction fee revenue  as reported less non equity related transaction fee revenue less soft dollar revenues and commission recapture expenses less broker dealer rebates net equity transaction fee revenue us transaction fee revenue from us equities less non equity related transaction fee revenue less soft dollar revenues and commission recapture expenses from us equities less broker dealer rebates net equity transaction fee revenue from us equities average us revenue capture per share average us equity transaction fee revenue per share  per side less non equity related transaction fee revenue less soft dollar revenues and commission recapture expenses from us equities less broker dealer rebates average us equity net transaction fee revenue per share  per side year ended december  in thousands  except revenue capture per share non us transaction fee revenue from non us equities less soft dollar revenues and commission recapture expenses from non us equities net equity transaction fee revenue from non us equities total expenses total expenses  as reported less soft dollar and commission recapture less broker dealer rebates less restructuring less goodwill and intangible assets impairment net expenses revenues our revenues consist of transaction fees  interest and investment income 
transaction fees accounted for the significant portion of our revenues 
these fees are commission and other revenues earned on our customers use of our various brokerage and related services  and fluctuate based upon share volumes and pricing changes 
these services include ecn transaction revenues  service bureau transaction fees  market data  communication  clearing and other brokerage services 
transaction fees also include soft dollar revenues and revenues that are subject to commission recapture which offset dollar for dollar the expenses we incur in paying for research from independent third parties and for commission recapture payments to pension plan and other fund sponsors 
ecn transaction fee revenues include commissions charged to broker dealers who consume liquidity from our ecn 
the commissions we charge to liquidity consumers more than offset the amount we pay broker dealers who provide liquidity to our ecn 
for transactions in us equity securities  we generally base our fees on a per share basis 
our broker dealer customers are subject to a fee schedule that provides for a per share amount that declines based upon pre set volume levels 
our institutional customers pay a per share amount based upon the customer s level of usage of our services 
for transactions in non us equity securities  we generally base our fees on the transaction value per trade as is customary in the international markets in which we operate  and also take into account the customer s level of trading activity as well as local market settlement costs 
clearing fees are earned on a per ticket basis 
a ticket refers to one or more customer transactions grouped together for clearing purposes 
in some cases  a single transaction is cleared using more than one ticket 
interest income is interest earned on the cash provided as collateral on stock borrow transactions related to our clearing business  our interest earning assets  which primarily consist of fixed income securities  and on our cash balances 
investment income consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses  dividends and other income earned on a series of strategic alliances and long term investments we have made in other companies  as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses from our marketable securities 
operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries  incentive compensation and related employee benefits and taxes 
salaries and benefits account for just over half of our employee compensation and benefits expense 
many employees receive annual incentive compensation based on our overall operating results 
some employees  such as sales employees  receive periodic incentive compensation based on new customer acquisitions and revenues 
as a result  a portion of this expense fluctuates based on our operating results and our revenue 
as part of our cost reduction initiatives  we have been reducing our employee base  which we expect will result in lower compensation expense in the future 
soft dollar and commission recapture expense consists primarily of expenses we incur to purchase research products from third parties for our customers in connection with our soft dollar research business  as well as commission recapture payments to pension plan and other fund sponsors 
our soft dollar and commission recapture expense fluctuates based upon the level of our customers demand for these services and overall market transaction volumes 
broker dealer rebates represent commission rebates paid to broker dealers who provide liquidity to our ecns as part of our pricing for broker dealers 
we charge commissions to broker dealers who remove liquidity from our ecns  which is recorded as transaction fee revenue 
the commissions we charge to liquidity removed more than offset the rebate amounts we pay to broker dealers who provide liquidity to our ecns 
brokerage  clearing and exchange fees include fees paid to clearing entities for clearing and settlement services  fees paid to floor brokers exchanges and other ecns for trade execution and fees paid to third party vendors for data processing services 
these costs generally fluctuate based on transaction volumes 
communications and equipment expense consists primarily of costs for our network connections with our customers  costs for maintenance of our core network  costs for software  computers and other equipment  and fees for access to stock market data 
communications and equipment expense generally fluctuates based upon long term trends in our business activity and the services we offer to our customers 
certain elements of this expense  which we incur in anticipation of certain transaction volume levels  have both a fixed and variable nature 
once we incur these expenses initially  we may not incur them going forward on a recurring  annual basis 
as a result of the importance of our systems to the viability of our business  we continue to invest heavily in areas such as system capacity and reliability  increased functionality and performance  and security 
we also must modify our systems from time to time to comply with various regulatory requirements  such as the sec order handling rules and regulation ats 
the expenses we incur for these modifications may vary substantially from period to period 
depreciation and amortization expense results primarily from the depreciation of the fixed assets we purchase  as well as the amortization of goodwill resulting from our acquisitions and other intangible assets 
goodwill amortization was recorded until january   when we adopted new accounting rules  which require that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings 
in  we wrote off all of our goodwill 
write offs of fixed assets and an impairment charge in are expected to reduce future depreciation and amortization by million in occupancy expense includes the costs of leasing  furnishing and maintaining our office and operations space  primarily in the new york metropolitan area 
occupancy expense is primarily affected by increases or decreases in the number of employees and expansion or contraction of our services and related support functions 
as part of our cost cutting initiatives and reduction of workforce  we consolidated our office space and expect lower occupancy costs in professional fees include fees paid to consultants as well as legal and accounting fees 
marketing and business development expense consists primarily of production  media  print  client entertainment and other expenses incurred to create brand awareness  promote our services and introduce new products 
it also includes client entertainment expenses 
other expenses consist primarily of interest expense  administrative expenses  provision for bad debt  as well as other general office costs 
provision benefit for income taxes includes taxes related to our income in each country or jurisdiction in which we operate 
the difference between our effective tax rate and the us statutory tax rate may differ period to period  but primarily results from state and local taxes in the us  foreign income taxes  valuation allowances against losses that may not be realized and the effect of certain non deductible expenses 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies related to our strategic alliances and long term investments investments  allowance for doubtful accounts and goodwill are the most critical accounting policies that require us to make estimates and use judgments that could affect our results 
investments our investments are stated at estimated fair value as determined in good faith by management 
generally  we will initially value investments at cost as a proxy for fair value  and require that changes in value be established by meaningful third party transactions or a significant impairment in the financial condition or operating performance of the issuer  unless meaningful developments occur that otherwise warrant a change in the valuation of an investment 
factors considered in valuing individual investments include  without limitation  available market prices  type of security  purchase price  purchases of the same or similar securities by other investors  marketability  restrictions on disposition  current financial position and operating results  and other pertinent information 
we use our best judgment in estimating the fair value of these investments 
there are inherent limitations to any estimation technique 
the fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of an amount that we could realize in a current transaction 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation  these estimated fair values do not necessarily represent amounts that might be ultimately realized  since such amounts depend on future circumstances  and the differences could be material

was written off and subsequently sold to nikko salomon smith barney for approximately million 
tp group ldc was liquidated and as part of the liquidation we received approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if other circumstances arise  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our revenue 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques and that management perform a detailed review of the carrying value of the company s tangible and intangible assets 
in this process  management is required to make estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities and projected future earnings using various valuation techniques 
management uses its best judgment and information available to it at the time to perform this review  as well as the services of an expert valuation specialist 
because management s assumptions and estimates are used in the valuation  actual results may differ 
in  our annual impairment testing indicated impairment in the value of technology assets capitalized at the time of the island acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 based on the results of management s analysis  we determined that our intangible assets had been impaired and as a result  we recorded a pre tax charge of million 
in  we performed the same impairment test and determined that our book value exceeded its fair market value 
based on the results of management and a valuation analysis prepared by an independent specialist  we determined that our existing goodwill had been completely impaired and as a result  we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment loss of million  the remaining carrying value of our goodwill  as of september  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies

for a description of how we calculate our share volumes  see volume calculations 
our net equity transaction fee revenues are calculated by subtracting the soft dollar and commission recapture expenses and broker dealer rebates from the related equity transaction fees 
gaap requires us to add our soft dollar and commission recapture expenses and broker dealer rebates  dollar for dollar  to related equity transaction fee revenues 
see non gaap financial measurements 
average transaction fee revenue is calculated by dividing transaction fee revenue for the buy and sell side of each transaction by total share volume 
represents instinet group incorporated volume from all sources  including the island ecn subsequent to september  volume calculations in computing our us share volume in either nasdaq listed or us exchange listed equities  we count the customer share volume on one side of the trade  whether or not the trade matches with another customer or is routed to another execution venue 
for example  where a customer sells shares to another customer as a matched trade  we count shares  if the trade were routed we count shares 
in computing our total market share  our numerator share volume is counted as described above for each market where we disclose a market share statistic 
the denominator for nasdaq market share is total nasdaq share volume as published by nasdaq 
historical amounts may be restated due to updates of volume information from nasdaq 
for us exchange listed market share  the denominator is the total share volume of us listed markets obtained from a widely recognized market data vendor 
listed markets include the new york stock exchange  american stock exchange  boston stock exchange  philadelphia stock exchange  national stock exchange  chicago stock exchange and pacific stock exchange 
we count our volume differently in our customer operating data disclosures as described therein 
calculation of inet volumes prior to  we operated instinet and island ecn as two separate atss  however  we disclosed the volumes from our two atss on a combined basis 
instinet customers had the option  for certain orders  to automatically send parts of orders that could not be filled on the instinet system to the island system 
in calculating our combined volumes  we eliminate one side of these routed orders 
in february  we substantially completed our consolidation of order flow to the inet ats

our soft dollar revenues and our revenues that are subject to commission recapture  which are offset dollar for dollar by our soft dollar research payments and commission recapture expenses  decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in volume from our soft dollar clients partially offset by increased client use of the commission recapture services provided by our clients of our lynch  jones ryan subsidiary 
expenses compensation and benefits expense decreased to million in from million in due to declines in salary and benefits expense and lower incentive compensation 
the decline in salary and benefits expense was due to declines in our employee base as a result of our cost reduction initiatives and reduction of certain benefit programs 
lower incentive compensation was due to our lower profitability 
this decrease was partially offset by a severance charge of million in related to employee reductions 
our average number of employees was  in and  in which includes island employees from september 
our total headcount decreased to  employees as of december  from  employees as of december  including employees from island 
soft dollar and commission recapture expense decreased to million in from million in this expense is offset dollar for dollar by soft dollar revenues and revenues that are subject to commission recapture 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in volume from our soft dollar clients partially offset by increased client use of commission recapture services provided by our lynch  jones ryan subsidiary 
broker dealer rebates increased to million in from million in the increase was due to higher volume resulting primarily from our acquisition of island and the inclusion in of a full year of rebate expenses 
we began offering broker dealer rebates in march brokerage  clearing and exchange fees decreased to million in from million in the impact of higher transaction volume was more than offset by lower clearing and settlement costs  particularly in the us  due to a decline in trade reporting expenses and benefits from technology efficiencies 
communications and equipment expense decreased to million in from million in our costs declined throughout as we migrated certain clients off of our proprietary in house network to a third party platform 
the migration was substantially complete by the end of the third quarter of depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to higher amortization related to our intangible assets  which we acquired in connection with our acquisitions of island and protrader 
this increase was partially offset by lower depreciation of our leasehold improvements associated with reduced space needs as part of our cost reduction efforts 
occupancy expense decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to decreased rent expense due to consolidation of our office space in the new york metropolitan area as part of our cost reduction initiative 
this decrease was partially offset by a one time charge of million related to the consolidation of our office space as part of the cost reduction initiative announced in march  as well as our acquisition of island 
other expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower bad debt expense related to commission receivables from customers and lower bad debt expense associated with loans made to strategic investment partners in  as well as lower interest expense due to lower interest rates and lower discretionary and office related expenses 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment during the fourth quarter of  our annual impairment testing indicated impairment in the value of technology assets capitalized at the time of the island acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 based on an impairment analysis conducted by management  we determined that our intangible assets had been impaired and as a result  we recorded a pre tax charge of million 
we recorded a related tax benefit of million related to this charge 
during the third quarter of  in accordance with sfas no 
 based on the results of a valuation analysis prepared by an independent specialist  we determined that our existing goodwill had been completely impaired and as a result and as a result we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment loss of million  the remaining carrying value of our goodwill 
this was a non cash charge and resulted in no reduction in tangible book value 
we recorded a related tax benefit of approximately million related to this charge 
restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the reduction of workforce by approximately employees or approximately of full time employees  expected to be substantially completed by july  and the consolidation of the company s office space  which accounts for a significant portion of the charge 
this cost reduction action is primarily due to the strategic decisions related to the separation of instinet and inet  and the company s ongoing efforts to streamline its operations 
in march  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in order to offset the impact of reduced revenues due to our price reductions to us broker dealer customers 
in december  we announced additional cost reductions  and as a result we recorded a pre tax charge of million primarily due to cost synergies in connection with our acquisition of island 
the charge also reflects expenses associated with reducing staff  consolidation of office space within the new york city area and internationally and the closure of the remaining offices of our protrader subsidiary 
discontinued operations in may  we closed our fixed income trading platform 
we began developing our fixed income business in and started trading in the spring of against the background of a global economic slowdown and the uneven pace of acceptance of electronic fixed income trading platforms  the business had been unable to reach a critical mass 
as a result of the closure  we incurred a charge  net of tax  of million in cumulative effect of change in accounting principle the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to goodwill  net of tax  was million in we adopted sfas no 
on january  sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment 
impairment is deemed to exist when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
this methodology differs from our previous policy  as permitted under accounting standards existing before sfas no 
 of using undiscounted cash flows of the businesses acquired over its estimated life 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we incurred goodwill impairment before tax of million related to our acquisition of protrader and million related to our acquisition of montag p pper partner gmbh  a fixed income broker dealer in germany 
decreased customer transaction volumes led to operating losses  closure of several trading offices and restructuring of our protrader subsidiary 
in addition  after a review of market conditions we determined our fixed income operations could not reach critical mass and therefore the carrying value of goodwill related to our acquisition of montag was impaired and written off 
income taxes benefit our tax benefit decreased to million in from a benefit of million in as a result of decreased loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
our effective income tax rate increased to in from in this increase primarily resulted from the permanent impairment of goodwill that was not deductible for tax purposes in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview net loss decreased to million for from net income of million for primarily due to a million charge for goodwill impairment  a restructuring charge and a write down in our investments in our revenues decreased to billion for from billion for the comparable period in  primarily as a result of lower average pricing  which more than offset revenues related to our increased share volumes and acquisition of island

our expenses for included a restructuring charge of million 
island contributed million of expenses in revenues transaction fee revenue decreased to billion in to billion in transaction fee revenue excluding revenues directly related to soft dollar and commission recapture as well as broker dealer rebates declined to million in from billion in these decreases were primarily due to a decline in average pricing as a result of our pricing changes

primarily due to the acquisition of island in september  our various pricing changes  and the introduction of our broker dealer rebates  we increased our trading volumes and market share in nasdaq listed and us exchange listed stocks from through  however  the decrease in our average pricing more than offset the effect of the increases in our trading volumes

our soft dollar revenues and our revenues that are subject to commission recapture  which are offset dollar for dollar by our soft dollar research payments and commission recapture expenses  decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a decrease in our soft dollar revenues due to reduced use of this service partly offset by increased use of the commission recapture services provided by our lynch  jones and ryan subsidiary 
interest revenue decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates  which affects the revenue generated by our stock borrowing activities related to our clearing services  as well as a decrease in our interest bearing cash and cash equivalents 
investments revenue decreased to a loss of million in from a gain of million in the loss was primarily due to write downs of million where management made a determination that the fair value of investments was impaired and million for investments accounted for under the equity method  offset by gains on our securities owned  including million on our sale of shares in the toronto stock exchange upon its demutualization and initial public offering in november expenses compensation and benefits expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our worldwide headcount  particularly in our us offices  the closure of our fixed income business as part of our cost reduction initiatives  as well as a decline in incentive compensation due to our lower revenues 
our average headcount was  in and  in our total headcount decreased to  employees including employees from island as of december  from  employees as of december  soft dollar and commission recapture expense decreased to million in from million in this expense is offset dollar for dollar by soft dollar revenues and revenues that are subject to commission recapture 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our soft dollar costs due to lower volumes partly offset by expanded use of our commission recapture services offered by our lynch jones ryan subsidiary 
broker dealer rebates were million in as noted above  as part of our pricing incentives for broker dealers  we now offer commission rebates to broker dealers who provide liquidity  which is recorded as an expense  and charge commissions to broker dealers who consume liquidity  which is recorded as transaction fee revenue 
the commissions we charge to liquidity consumers more than offset the amount we pay to broker dealers who provide liquidity to our ecns 
brokerage  clearing and exchange fees increased to million in from million in this increase was due to higher brokerage and exchange fees as a result of our new order routing technology which allows us to route trades to other ecns  which in turn  charge us fees for this service  our acquisition of island and fees charged to our protrader subsidiary 
partly offsetting these increases were a reduction in our regulatory fees and lower us clearing costs as a result of implementing certain technology efficiencies  such as trade compression 
communications and equipment expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was due in large part to lower core communications costs  which decreased to million in from million in  reflecting the benefit of improved network and systems efficiencies 
our equipment and software costs for upgrading our existing systems and other enhancements decreased to million in from million in primarily due to decreased spending in this area 
our exchange data access charges also decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to the sale of our research and analytics product to reuters in september depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due a reduction in depreciation of our capitalizable assets  which decreased as part of our cost reduction initiatives  offsetting a slight increase due to our acquisition of island 
in addition  we ceased amortizing goodwill as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
offsetting this decrease in goodwill amortization was amortization related to our intangible assets  which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of island and protrader 
occupancy expense increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased property insurance  maintenance and one time costs associated with our move to new corporate headquarters in new york and our acquisition of island 
partly offsetting these increases was a decrease in rent expense due to consolidation of our office space in the new york metropolitan area 
professional fees decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to reduced use of technical and management consultants  partly offset by an increase in our legal expenses and our acquisition of island 
marketing and business development decreased to million in from million in this decrease was due to a scaling back of our branding campaign as a result of our cost reduction initiatives 
other expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in our provision for bad debts due to loans we made to our strategic investments  payments to reuters in connection with the sale of our r a product in order to allow our customers to receive this service and support from reuters instead of us  and interest costs related to our securities lending and other clearing activities 
partly offsetting these increases were decreases in our travel expenses as part of our cost reduction initiatives  a one time refund of value added tax previously paid to certain non us tax authorities and interest expense related to a loan reuters provided to us to fund our acquisition of lynch jones ryan in february this loan was repaid in june restructuring expense in march  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in order to offset the impact of reduced revenues due to our price reductions to us broker dealer customers 
in december  we announced additional cost reductions  and as a result  we recorded a pre tax charge of million primarily due to cost synergies in connection with our acquisition of island 
the charge also reflects expenses associated with reducing staff  consolidation of office space within the new york city area and internationally and the closure of the remaining offices of our protrader subsidiary 
in  in order to address the declines in our margins  we announced a cost reduction and restructuring program 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax charge of million this charge reflects expenses associated with employee severance and consolidation costs for certain office locations 
income taxes provision benefit our tax benefit was million in compared to a provision of million in as a result of our loss from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
our effective income tax rate decreased to in from in this decrease resulted from the permanent impairment of goodwill that was not deductible for tax purposes  restructuring charges  write down in our investments  operating losses in tax jurisdictions where utilization of tax losses is doubtful and other valuation allowances

the information set forth certain unaudited operating data that reflects our ongoing business restructuring plan

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information for the first quarter of average daily us equity share volume is counted as the sum of our customer s share volume per side related to a trade 
for example a matched trade where one customer buys shares and the other sells shares is counted as shares  if the buy or sell order were routed out we would count shares on the customer side

note results for island holding company  inc are included subsequent to september  liquidity and capital resources we finance our business primarily through cash generated by our operating activities 
in addition  we have access to a number of credit facilities  although our borrowings under these facilities have been traditionally low 
in  the net proceeds from our initial public offering were also a source of funding for us 
our financial liquidity is primarily determined by the performance of our business and partly by the return on our investments 
we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet that can fluctuate significantly between financial statement dates 
capital expenditures are for the purchase of data processing and communications equipment  leasehold improvements and purchases of furniture for our office facilities 
our cash equivalents and securities owned are primarily comprised of highly liquid investments that can be sold in the secondary market  if necessary 
we currently anticipate that our existing cash resources and credit facilities will be more than sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and regulatory capital requirements  operating losses  restructuring charges and other anticipated requirements for at least the next twelve months 
since our initial public offering  acquisitions have generally been funded from the proceeds from our initial public offering  cash generated by our operations or through issuance of our common stock 
to the extent that overall market volumes and our trading volumes decrease beyond certain levels  we may be required to obtain additional financing from third parties or reuters 
prior to our initial public offering in  acquisitions of new businesses had generally been funded through subordinated borrowings from reuters 
cash and cash equivalents  together with assets readily convertible into cash  accounted for and of our assets as of december  and  respectively 
assets readily convertible into cash consist primarily of the following components as set forth on our statements of financial condition receivables from broker dealers principally represent amounts due on securities transactions that have not been completed as of the settlement date 
the settlement date generally occurs within three business days of the trade date for us securities transactions  but can take as long as days for non us equity transactions 
receivables from customers principally represent customer debit balances and amounts due on securities transactions that have not been completed as of the settlement date 
commission receivable represents commissions transactions fees principally from broker dealers 
securities owned consist principally of us government and agency securities  municipal bonds and corporate bonds in which we invest our excess cash 
for the purpose of this calculation  we have excluded the shares we own in various stock exchanges 
securities borrowed represent the amount of collateral deposited with brokers securing marketable equity securities borrowed by us in connection with covering customer securities transactions in our clearing business 
for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  cash of million was provided by operating activities  reflecting cash from operations net loss less non cash items and lower net levels of securities borrowed and restricted cash due to lower customer settlement requirements 
cash of million was generated from investing activities primarily from the sale of securities owned  net of purchases  of million and insurance proceeds of million for fixed assets lost at the world trade center  partially offset by capital expenditures of million for fixed assets and leasehold improvements 
cash of million was used in financing activities primarily for the repayment of short term borrowings 
for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  cash of million was used in operating activities  primarily reflecting our operating loss during the year 
cash of million was used in investing activities primarily for the purchase of securities owned  net of sales  of million and capital expenditures of million for fixed assets and leasehold improvements  partially offset by cash acquired in excess of net assets of million from our island acquisition 
cash of million was used in financing activities primarily due to our special dividend payment of million in connection with our acquisition of island and repayment of short term borrowings of million 
additionally  we issued approximately million common stock shares for the island acquisition 
for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  cash of million was provided by operating activities  primarily reflecting our operating income during the year 
cash of million was used in investing activities primarily for capital expenditures of million for fixed assets and leasehold improvements  the sale of securities owned  net of purchases  of million and strategic investments of million to fund our acquisition of protrader 
this was partially offset by insurance proceeds of million for fixed assets lost at the world trade center 
cash of million was provided by financing activities primarily from our initial public offering of million 
partially offsetting cash received from our offering was a return of capital of million to reuters 
we funded that return of capital through an intercompany advance from reuters 
we repaid that advance in may out of the net proceeds we received from our initial public offering 
in addition  reuters loaned us million to fund our acquisition of lynch  jones ryan this loan bore interest at an annual rate based on six month libor plus and was repaid in changes in our total assets and liabilities  in particular  receivable from broker dealers and customers  securities borrowed  and commissions receivable and payable to broker dealers and customers  generally lead to large fluctuations in our cash flows from operating activities from period to period and within periods 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our future cash payments associated with contractual obligations  which are primarily operating leases for office space and capital leases for equipment under non cancelable operating leases with reuters and third parties 
our aggregate minimum lease commitments after years primarily relate to our year lease cancellable after for our headquarters in new york 
contractual payments due by period less than after total year years years years in millions operating leases capital lease obligation total contractual obligations other obligations as of december  and  we had letter of credit agreements and guarantees totaling million and million issued by commercial banking institutions on our behalf to various non us securities clearing and regulatory agencies  as well as other corporate services and obligations 
we pay an annual fee of up to one percent of the value of the agreement 
as of december  and  we had access to million and million  respectively  of uncommitted credit lines from commercial banking institutions to meet the funding needs of our us operations 
these credit lines are collateralized by a combination of customer securities and our marketable securities 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit lines 
we currently pay no annual fees to maintain these facilities 
in addition  as of december  and  we had access to million and million  respectively  of uncommitted credit lines from commercial banking institutions to meet the funding needs of our european and asian subsidiaries 
during  our lenders reviewed our credit facility usage and reduced these lines of credit accordingly 
the credit lines are uncollateralized  and we currently pay no annual fees to maintain these facilities 
as of december  and  there were million and million  respectively  outstanding under these credit lines 
prior to our initial public offering  reuters had issued non binding  short term letters to certain of these institutions confirming its ownership of us and indicating that if we were to default under the relevant facility  reuters would consider  without any obligation  requests by these institutions for compensation 
reuters has withdrawn these letters and advised us that it will not issue any additional letters our broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their respective general financial soundness and liquidity  which require that they comply with certain minimum capital requirements 
these regulations  which differ in each country  generally prohibit a broker dealer subsidiary from repaying borrowings from us or our affiliates  paying cash dividends  making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that would result in a significant reduction in its regulatory net capital position without prior notification or approval of its principal regulator 
our capital structure is designed to provide each of our subsidiaries with capital and liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory requirements

our international broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate 
as of december  and  these subsidiaries had met their local capital adequacy requirements 
we have an active securities borrowing and lending business  where we borrow securities from one party and lend them to another  as well as to facilitate the settlement process to meet our customers needs 
under these transactions  we either receive or provide collateral  generally cash 
when we borrow securities  we provide cash to the lenders as collateral and earn interest on the cash 
similarly  when we loan securities  we receive cash as collateral and pay interest to the borrower 
the initial collateral advanced or received approximates  or is greater than  fair value of the securities borrowed or loaned 
in the event the counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligations to return the pledged collateral  we may be exposed to the market risk of acquiring the collateral at prevailing market prices 
we provided million and million as collateral for securities borrowed as of december  and  respectively 
we also received million and million as collateral for securities loaned as of december  and  respectively 
included in commissions and other receivables is approximately million from archipelago holdings  llc and redibook ecn llc of which we have commenced arbitration proceedings before the nasd for approximately million

in connection with our correspondent clearing business  we are required to maintain segregated funds in a special reserve bank account for the exclusive benefit of our customers 
as of december  and  these funds amounted to million and million 
in addition  so long as reuters owns a majority of our common stock  we will need reuters consent to incur net indebtedness indebtedness for borrowed money less cash on hand in excess of an aggregate of million and any indebtedness incurred by us in the ordinary course of our brokerage or similar business or in connection with the clearance of securities or obligations to securities exchanges or clearing systems 
we cannot assure you that we will receive reuters consent to incur indebtedness above this amount in the future if we need to do so for any reason 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement and which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument that might result from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks in the normal course of our business operations 
interest rate risk we invest a portion of our available cash in marketable securities  classified as securities owned in our consolidated statements of financial condition  to maximize yields while continuing to meet our cash and liquidity needs and the net capital requirements of our regulated subsidiaries 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio of securities consisting of the following december  in millions municipal bonds corporate bonds foreign sovereign obligations us government and federal agency obligations total these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if interest rates increase 
if interest rates had increased immediately and uniformly by basis points  or basis points in the case of municipal bonds  as of december  and  the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by million and million  respectively 
we generally hold these securities until maturity and therefore would not expect our financial condition  operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in interest rates 
in addition  as a part of our brokerage business  we invest portions of our cash in short term interest earning assets mainly cash and money market instruments  which totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we also had short term borrowings of million and million as of december  and  respectively  on which we are generally charged rates that approximate the us federal funds rate or the local equivalent rate 
as a result  we do not anticipate that changes in interest rates will have a material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
exchange rate risk a portion of our operations consists of brokerage services provided outside of the us 
therefore  our results of operations could be adversely affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
we are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates on the british pound and the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of us dollar based revenues decreases 
when the us dollar weakens against these currencies  the us dollar value of non us dollar based revenues increases 
correspondingly  the non us dollar value of non us dollar based costs increases when the non us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates may affect our results 
however  we do not believe that our exchange rate exposure will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  therefore  we have not hedged this exposure 
in the future  we may enter into derivative financial instruments as a means of hedging this risk 
we manage currency exposure related to our brokerage business on a geographic basis 
we generally match each of the non us subsidiary s liabilities with assets denominated in the same local currency and manage each subsidiary s balance sheet in local currency 
this generally results in the net equity of the subsidiary being reported in its functional currency and subject to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates when translated into the us dollar  our reporting currency 
we currently do not seek to mitigate this exchange rate exposure  but we may in the future 
we may enter into forward foreign currency contracts to facilitate our customers settling transactions in various currencies  primarily the us dollar  british pound or euro 
these forward foreign currency contracts are with third parties and with terms generally identical to our customers transactions 
because our customers transactions are matched to the forward foreign exchange contract  our exposure to exchange rate risk is not material 
the following is a breakdown of the currency denominations of our securities owned december  in millions british pounds euros japanese yen canadian dollar hong kong dollar total our resulting exposure to exchange rate risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates due to functional versus reporting currency exposure and was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a portion of our revenues are denominated in non us dollar currencies 
approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were so denominated 
our profits are therefore exposed to foreign currency risk not a loss of funds but rather a loss for financial reporting purposes 
we estimate this risk as the potential loss in revenue resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates on the mix in our profits between our functional currency and the respective reporting currencies of our subsidiaries 
on this basis  the estimated risk of revenue loss was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
equity price risk as an agency broker  we do not trade securities for our own account or maintain inventories of securities for sale 
however  as of december   we own marketable securities of the london and euronext stock exchanges as a result of their demutualizations  and we are exposed to market price risk 
as of december   we also owned marketable securities of the hong kong stock exchange 
this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted market prices and amounted to approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
credit risk on unsettled trades we are exposed to substantial credit risk from both parties to a securities transaction during the period between the transaction date and the settlement date 
this period is generally three business days in the us equities markets and can be as much as days in some international markets 
in addition  we have credit exposure that extends beyond the settlement date in the case of a party that does not settle in a timely manner by failing either to make payment or to deliver securities 
we hold the securities that are the subject of the transaction as collateral for our customer receivables 
adverse movements in the prices of these securities can increase our credit risk 
the majority of the company s transactions and  consequently  the concentration of its credit exposure are with broker dealers and other financial institutions  primarily located in the us and the us the company seeks to control its credit risk through a variety of reporting and control procedures  including establishing credit limits and enforcing credit standards based upon a review of the counter parties financial condition and credit ratings 
the company monitors trading activity and collateral levels on a daily basis for compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines and obtains additional collateral  if appropriate 
for the years ended december   and  losses from transactions in which a party refused or was unable to settle have been immaterial 
we are also exposed to credit risks from third parties that owe us money  securities or other obligations 
these parties include our customers  trading counterparties  clearing agents  exchanges and other financial institutions 
these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
over the last three years  our loss from a counterparty refusing to pay or was unable to settle with us have been immaterial 
we are exposed to the credit worthiness of agencies with which we invest a portion of our available cash  primarily us and non us government and agency obligations  as well as corporate and municipal bonds 
for investments maturing within nine months  our credit policy is that all investments have at least an a p credit rating from standard poor s and moody s investors service 
we also maintain counterparty concentration limits that specify the amount that we can invest with any one counterparty
