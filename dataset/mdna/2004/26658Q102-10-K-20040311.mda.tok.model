the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are not limited to historical facts  but reflect our current beliefs  expectations  or risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to be materially different from those in the forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
hereinafter  the terms duratek  we  our or the company and similar terms refer to duratek  inc and its subsidiaries  unless the context indicates otherwise 
overview we operate in a complex environment due to the nature of our customers and our projects 
these factors are described throughout this annual report on form k  including under risk factors 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of overall risk  revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
depending on the contract  this poses challenges to our executive management team in overseeing contract performance and in evaluating the timing of the recognition of revenues and project costs  both initially and when there is a change in project status 
thus  our executive management team spends considerable time in evaluating and structuring key contracts  in monitoring project performance  and in assessing the financial impact of many of our contracts 
due to the complexity in the revenue recognition for our projects  executive financial management is particularly attentive to developments in individual contracts that may affect the timing of revenues and related costs 
during  a number of projects continued to experience volatility with regards to financial results due to developments and risks associated with our projects and the continual changing environment for our customers 
the following is a summary of significant events in that had an impact on our financial results and thus received considerable financial management attention and scrutiny in the third quarter of  we recorded a million reduction of gross profit as a result of an estimated loss on our emwmf project in the federal services segment 
these losses were incurred as a result of additional costs associated with record rain amounts in tennessee that resulted in additional processing costs 
we are aggressively managing the project to minimize future losses and are preparing several requests for equitable adjustments on the project that could help us reduce this estimated loss in the future 
in the third quarter of  we adjusted the schedule and cost assumptions that are used to determine our incentive fees for a significant project in the federal services segment 
we are a subcontractor on this project and are following the estimates that were revised by our prime contractor in august this resulted in a contract to date revenue increase of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million reduction of revenue relating to a decrease in award fees earned during on a federal government project in the federal services segment due to failure of the prime contractor to meet certain regulatory and contract milestones 
in the second quarter of  we recognized million of additional profit in the commercial services segment and a million increase in revenues in the commercial processing and disposal segment as a result of the successful completion of a large fixed price logistics and transportation project 
this project was completed ahead of schedule and below budget 
we incurred an additional million of interest expense in the fourth quarter of due to the write off of the unamortized deferred financing costs that were incurred in in connection with our prior credit facility and replaced in december with our new credit facility 
on december   we repurchased  shares of our cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock 
par value cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock from the investment partnerships controlled by the carlyle group for million in cash plus accrued and unpaid dividends of million 
this resulted in a million of charges similar to a dividend  which is included in preferred stock repurchase premium  dividends  and charges for accretion in our consolidated statements of operations 
we continue to aggressively manage our projects to minimize these risks and the financial impact on us 
more information on risks and our efforts to manage risks are available in item of this report 
we provide services to commercial and government customers in the united states that ensure safe and secure radioactive materials disposition and nuclear facility operations 
we possess a breadth of capabilities  technologies  assets  facilities  and qualified technical personnel that enable us to provide a full array of safe and secure radioactive materials disposition services 
our services include decommissioning services  nuclear facility operations  radioactive material characterization  processing  transportation  accident containment and restoration services  and final disposal 
our operations are organized into three primary segments i federal services  ii commercial services  and iii commercial processing and disposal 
our revenues are derived almost equally from government and commercial customers 
our federal services segment provides the following services as a contractor or subcontractor for the united states department of energy doe and other governmental entities radioactive and hazardous waste characterization  storage  processing  packaging  transportation  and disposal services  nuclear facility commissioning  operations  and decommissioning  technology and engineering expertise  and on site environmental remediation services on large government projects 
the timing and scope of doe waste treatment projects will affect future operating results 
these projects are typically approved and awarded when funding has been appropriated as part of the federal government s annual budget process 
most of these projects are long term and are required as part of environmental legislation 
however  these projects are continually at risk of funding adjustments depending on the federal government s current financial resources 
our commercial services segment provides a broad range of proven technologies and services to nuclear power plants  government and industrial facilities  universities  and research pharmaceutical laboratories 
our services include the following liquid waste processing  transportation logistics including complete brokerage services and large component disposition  radiological emergency response  area  building  and site characterization and decommissioning  instrumentation calibration and rental  and training 
we also provide technical support services to our commercial clients including project management  engineering  radiation protection support  and environmental consulting 
these projects are typically approved and awarded by the respective commercial customer when funding has been appropriated as part of their annual budget process 
most of these projects are short term and required as part of environmental legislation 
however  these projects are continually at risk of funding adjustments depending on the commercial customer s current financial resources 
our commercial processing and disposal segment operates two facilities in tennessee and two facilities in south carolina 
at the tennessee facilities  we use multiple technologies to volume reduce and package customer waste for final disposition such as incineration  compaction  metal melting and decontamination  and survey and release 
future operating results will be affected by  among other things  the duration of commercial waste processing contracts and the amount of waste to be processed by our commercial waste processing operations pursuant to these contracts 
at the south carolina facilities  we perform the following operations materials disposal for the department of defense  specialty waste processing for nuclear power plants  and operate a disposal facility for the state of south carolina 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to cost to complete long term contracts  the cost to decontaminate and decommission d d facilities and equipment  the recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex  or subjective judgments 
our most critical accounting policies  which relate to revenue recognition  d d liabilities  and recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill  are discussed below 
revenue recognition commercial waste processing the commercial waste processing operations have short term and long term contracts with commercial companies and governmental entities to provide waste processing services 
our services are primarily provided under fixed unit price contracts and usually require us to ship the processed waste product for burial on behalf of the customer 
our value added service is volume reduction of contaminated materials such as metal  wood  and paper to reduce the economic costs of burial 
we recognize revenues when a contract has been executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  as waste is processed  and collectibility of the contract price is considered probable 
revenue is recognized during the processing phase as units of waste are processed based on the unit prices quoted in the contracts ie as the waste product is output from the process 
revenues related to the out bound transportation and burial are deferred until the waste is shipped from our facility 
our fixed unit price contracts provide for additional customer billings if the characterization of the waste received is different from contract specifications or for certain increases in burial costs  both of which are estimated at the time waste is received and sorted 
as of december   we have deferred revenues of million relating to burial expense for waste that has been processed but has not been shipped from our facility 
as of december   we have unbilled receivables of million related to work performed that is billable upon completion of work and deferred revenues of million for cash collections in advance of our performance of service 
as of december   no amount of pending claims or pending change orders has been included in our revenues 
sometimes variances in weight and waste classification occur 
these variances are identified when the waste is sorted and during the processing cycle and can have either a positive or negative impact on revenue  depending on the contract 
when these variances are identified  revenue is adjusted to the correct weight or classification assuming the contract allows for such an adjustment 
contract revenue and cost recognition the federal services and commercial services segments have long term contracts to provide engineering and technical support services to the federal government and its agencies and to commercial companies 
we recognize revenues when a contract is executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  funding has been received in the case of federal government contracts  delivery of the service or products has occurred  and collectibility of the contract price is considered probable 
our federal government contracts are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the term on the contract as the services are provided 
from time to time  we may proceed with work based on customer direction pending a request for equitable adjustment rea or finalization and signing of formal funding documents 
we have an internal process for approving such work 
all revenue recognition is deferred during periods in which funding is not received and costs are expensed as they are incurred 
as of december   there are approximately million outstanding requests for equitable adjustments in federal services and approximately million outstanding in commercial services 
as of december   no amount of these claims has been included in the contract value 
during  we derived of our federal services and commercial service segments revenues from government contracts and of our federal services and commercial service segments revenues from commercial contracts 
our services are provided under time and materials  cost plus award or incentive fee  firm fixed price  and fixed unit rate contracts 
we do not enter into fixed price research and development contracts 
as of december   based on revenues  we had of time and materials contracts  of cost plus award or incentive fee contracts  of firm fixed price contracts  and of fixed unit rate contracts 
under our time and materials contracts  we are paid for labor and costs incurred at negotiated contractual rates 
profitability on these contracts is driven by the extent of utilization of our billable personnel and cost control 
we receive award and incentive fees on certain federal government contracts  which are accrued when estimable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we had recognized million in incentive fee revenues in  million in  and million in under our cost plus award or incentive fee contracts  some of which are subject to contract ceiling amounts  we are reimbursed for allowable costs and fees  which may be fixed or performance based 
if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or any applicable regulations  we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs 
under our incentive fee contracts  we are awarded fees if we meet certain contract commitments  including schedule  budget  and safety 
if any of these commitments are not accepted  we could have a reduction in expected revenues 
quarterly assessments are made to measure our compliance with established contract commitments 
we accrue award or incentive fees when estimable and collection is reasonably assured 
under our firm fixed price and fixed unit rate contracts  we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and  consequently  we are exposed to a number of risks 
these risks include underestimation of costs  problems with new technologies  unforeseen costs or difficulties  delays beyond our control  and economic and other changes that may occur during the contract period 
for firm fixed price contracts  our revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  and is based on the proportion of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs or units of production 
for fixed unit rate contracts  our revenues are recognized as units are completed based on the contractual unit rates 
for contracts entered into subsequent to july   we consider the segmentation criteria in emerging issues task force no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and determine if there are elements of our contracts that are inconsistent with the scope of percentage of completion accounting as set forth in statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
for those elements that are consistent with the scope of sop  we consider the segmentation criteria of sop and the aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contracts 
through december   we have segmented only one contract 
the estimates of revenues and expenses on client contracts change periodically in the normal course of business and due to contract modifications 
we record contract claims and pending change orders when revenue is probable  which generally is when accepted in writing by the customer 
as of december   no amount of these pending claims has been included in the revenue 
the cost to perform the work related to these claims and pending change orders is included in our estimates of contract profitability 
subcontractors have requested contract change orders totaling approximately million related to scope changes requested by our customers where we have made identical claims to the customers 
based on agreement with our customers and our understanding of the contracts  recovery by these subcontractors is contingent upon our recovery from our customers 
these amounts have not been included in the results of our operations 
provisions for estimated losses on individual contracts are made in the period in which the losses are identified and include all estimated direct costs to complete the contract excludes future general and administrative costs expected to be allocated to the contract 
contract acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
contracts typically provide for periodic billings monthly or based on contract milestones 
the difference between costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts is classified as unbilled receivables and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are classified as unearned revenues 
as of december   we have unbilled receivables for commercial services and federal services segments of million of which million related to work performed that is currently billable and deferred revenues for the commercial services and federal services segments of million for cash collections in advance of performance of services 
revisions in revenues  cost  and profit estimates  or measurements in the extent of progress toward completion are changes in accounting estimates accounted for in the period of change cumulative catch up method 
such revisions could occur at any time and the effects could be material 
a change order is included in total estimated contract revenue when revenue is probable  which generally is when accepted in writing by the customer 
until then  no revenue or profit is recognized 
although we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion of contract revenue and of contract completion costs on our long term engineering and construction contracts  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates  and it is possible that such variances could be material to our operating results 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract estimates  involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to estimates of the percentage of completion  award and incentive fees  claims pending change orders  and cost estimates through corporate policy  approval and monitoring processes  which includes a detailed monthly review and status report to management of all significant contracts with such risk 
the project manager submits a formal monthly activity report to management and all estimates are reviewed by the management for consistency and reasonableness 
d d liabilities we have responsibility related to the cost to d d the facilities and equipment in tennessee and south carolina and equipment used at customer sites in the commercial services segment 
such costs will generally be paid upon closure of such facilities or disposal of such equipment 
similarly  under our license granted by the state of south carolina and the atlantic interstate low level radioactive waste compact implementation act  we will be obligated for costs associated with the ultimate closure of the barnwell low level radioactive waste disposal facility in south carolina and its buildings and equipment located at the barnwell site 
we have recorded accruals related to these d d liabilities 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation aro as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the asset 
we are also required to record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the aro  the aro will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 on january   we recognized the following changes to our consolidated financial statements increase property  plant and equipment by million and increase facility and equipment d d liabilities by million 
we recognized a million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of tax million pre tax 
as of december   our d d liabilities consist of facility and equipment aro of million and barnwell closure of million 
under the terms of the atlantic interstate low level radioactive waste compact implementation act the act  and our license with the state of south carolina  we were required to establish a trust fund to cover the barnwell closure obligation  which limits our obligation to the amount of trust fund 
we update our closure and remediation cost estimates for d d on an annual basis 
these estimates are based on current technology  regulations  and burial rates 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact that changes in technology  regulations  and burial rates will have on the ultimate costs 
changes in these factors could have a material impact on these estimates 
recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill we have made significant business acquisitions for which we have recorded the fair value of long lived assets acquired and related goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  on january  as of december   we had million of goodwill and million of intangible assets with estimable useful lives on our consolidated balance sheet 
we do not have any other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
we tested our goodwill at the end of the first quarter of and in accordance with the standard and concluded that no impairment charge was required 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount of excess carrying value over fair value 
during   and  we concluded that no impairment charge was required

revenues decreased primarily due to the environmental management waste management facility emwmf project  the hanford rpp wtp projects  and incremental revenues recognized during relating to a large component project in memphis and from a consolidated joint venture 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in revenues relating to an incentive fee on a federal government subcontract  site d d projects  a transportation and logistics contract that was successfully completed  the transportation services operations  and revenues relating to the award of new work or the change in work scope on existing contracts in the federal services segment 
gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in revenues by the commercial services segment

a decrease in revenues of million relating the operation phase of the emwmf contract relating to a decrease in the waste receipt volume 
a decrease in revenues of million relating to the hanford rpp wtp projects due to a decrease in contract costs incurred as a result of the contract winding down 
incremental revenues of million recognized during from a consolidated joint venture related to work performed to clean up and close an environmental technology site in colorado 
effective october  we negotiated a buyout agreement with the joint venture partner and we continue to work on the project as a subcontractor to our former joint venture partner 
a decrease in revenues of million in compared to relating to a decrease in the level of incentive fees earned on a federal government subcontract primarily due to failure of the prime contractor to meet a regulatory milestone and a reduction of reimbursable expenses 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in revenues relating to an increase in revenues of million relating to revised estimates of an incentive fee accrued on a federal government subcontract 
this incentive fee is calculated based upon the project ed completion target date 
additional amounts may be earned under the incentive fee if the project completion date is earlier than the target date 
conversely  if the target date were delayed  lower amounts would be earned under the incentive fee 
during the third quarter of  we revised our accrual estimate based upon correspondence with the project s prime contractor and their discussion and correspondence with the customer which indicated that the target date 
an increase in revenues  net  of million relating to the award of new work or the change in work scope on existing contracts 
gross profit increased slightly primarily due to an increase in gross profit of million relating to the incentive fee recognized on a federal government subcontract 
an increase in gross profit of million relating to the award of new work or the change in work scope on existing contracts 
a loss provision recognized in relating to work performed to clean up and close a doe environmental technology site in colorado 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in gross profit relating to the emwmf contract had a decrease in gross profit of million in compared to relating to the reduction in waste receipt volumes as discussed above and a revision to the estimated contract profitability resulting from a reassessment of the project s status  which was required primarily due to an increase in cost estimated to operate the facility due to abnormal amounts of rain water at the emwmf site 
we are in negotiation with the customer to obtain equitable adjustments for the higher operating costs 
any increase in contract value will be included in revenue when approved by the customer 
a decrease in gross profit of million in compared to relating to the hanford rpp wtp projects as a result of the contract winding down

revenues of million relating to the successful completion of a transportation and logistics contract 
an increase in revenues of million from the transportation services operations relating to higher revenues from the rental of casks and an increase in business due to a change in the competitive environment that includes the loss of a competitor 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of million from the radiological engineering services business relating to low margin work that was not being pursued in gross profit increased million primarily due to the following an increase in gross profit of million relating to site d d projects  which include the award of new work

the barnwell operating rights revenue related to the amortization expense since july  partially offsetting these decreases was increases in revenues relating to an increase in revenues of million from the fixed based processing facility in tennessee due to an increase in activity relating to waste received from customers that does not require processing and can be directly sent for burial and higher processed volume  offset lower priced waste due to a change in the processed waste mix 
an increase in revenues of million from the barnwell operation primarily relating to disposal work performed on a transportation and logistics contract at the barnwell low level radioactive waste disposal site and revenues on special decommissioning work performed at the disposal site 
gross profit decreased million primarily due to revenues recognized in by the barnwell operation relating to the amortization expense of the barnwell operating rights  which represented the revenue on the amortization expense since july   and due to the fixed based processing facility in tennessee  which incurred higher personnel related expenses and expenses related to production 
excluding the effects of revenues relating to barnwell operating rights  gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased slightly 
selling  general and administrative expense and other non operating items selling  general and administrative expense decreased slightly primarily due to lower personnel related expenses as a result of a reduction in work force in and lower bank related fees  partially offset by an increase in professional services fees  bid and proposal expenses  information system related expenses  and directors fees 
interest expense in includes million of unamortized deferred financing costs that were expensed due to the establishment of the new credit facility in december the unamortized deferred financing costs were incurred in june in connection with the establishment of the prior credit facility 
excluding this amount  interest expense decreased as a result of the lower average borrowing and lower interest rates 
income taxes increased million primarily due to the increase in pre tax income and an increase in the effective tax rate from in to in the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily related to an internal revenue services audit 
our effective tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state income taxes and expenses that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes 
we recognized a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of tax  relating to the adoption of sfas no

partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of million relating to revenues recognized in from the sale of limited rights of our vitrification technology 
gross profit increased million primarily due to the increase in revenues  offset by the gain in of million on the sale of limited rights of our vitrification technology 
commercial services revenues decreased by million primarily due to the sale in april of the technical support services business and by million in the radiological engineering services business due to the completion of a large contract in relating to non utility clean up and emergency response 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in revenues of million from the site d d business due to an increase in the volume of work on an existing contract 
gross profit decreased by million primarily due to the decrease in revenues from the radiological engineering services business  from the technical support services business that was sold in april  and the completion of a large contract in relating to non utility clean up and emergency response  partially offset by an increase in gross profit from the site d d business 
commercial processing and disposal revenues increased million in primarily due to revenues of million relating to a large component project in memphis revenues of million recognized by the barnwell low level radioactive waste disposal facility relating to a decision by the south carolina public service commission to allow a portion of the amortization expense of the barnwell operating rights as a reimbursable allowable cost 
the incremental revenues recognized during include an adjustment to record revenue for the reimbursement of this amortization expense since july   the date that the decision by the south carolina public service commission went into effect 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in revenues primarily due to a decrease in revenues of million from the commercial processing operations in tennessee  primarily due to a change in the processed waste mix and lower processing volume 
a decrease in revenues of million from the barnwell low level radioactive waste disposal facility and the duratek consolidation services facility due to lower volumes of waste received in gross profit increased by million primarily due to operational problems in at the commercial processing operation in tennessee 
the results included a million provision for loss on a large component project and a million accrual for costs associated with various high radiation customer waste 
in addition  the following contributed towards the gross profit increase lower labor expense as a result of a reduction in the work force  a decrease in transportation expense due to the increased use of rail transportation  lower material expense  a more favorable mix of waste than previously estimated on a significant high radiation project completed in  and lower burial expense relating to the commercial processing operations 
revenues recognized by the barnwell low level radioactive waste disposal facility on the amortization of barnwell operating rights also contributed to the increase 
as a result of these items  gross profit as a percent of revenues increased significantly 
selling  general and administrative expense and other non operating items selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million primarily due to a reduction in marketing expense  partially offset by higher personnel related expenses 
interest expense decreased by million as a result of the lower average borrowings and lower interest rates 
during  we incurred income tax expense of million  compared to an income tax benefit of million in as a result of our operating loss

historically  our primary liquidity requirements have been for debt service under our bank credit facilities  for working capital requirements  and for acquisitions 
we have funded these requirements primarily through internally generated operating cash flows and funds borrowed under our bank credit facilities  and we expect this to continue in on december   we repurchased  shares of our cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock from the investment partnerships controlled by the carlyle group for million in cash plus accrued and unpaid dividends of million 
the purchase was based on a price of per share of our common stock 
each share of cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock is convertible into shares of our common stock 
as of december   there were  shares of cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock outstanding that are held by the carlyle group 
in connection with the repurchase transaction  we entered into a stockholder agreement with the carlyle group

the stockholders agreement provides that we are obligated to purchase these  shares of cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock on or before september  at a minimum purchase price of per share

these shares are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock  
par value 
the repurchase transaction improves our near term cash flow by reducing the dividends on the cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock and replacing them with lower cost debt capital 
additionally  the repurchase transaction simplifies our capital structure  enhances our ability to attract additional capital  and eliminates the market uncertainty over the timing of a future conversion of the cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock and the sale of the underlying common stock by the carlyle group 
on december   in connection with the cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock repurchase transaction  we entered into a new bank credit facility 
as of december   the new bank facility consists of a million revolving line of credit  including a million sub limit for the issuance of standby letters of credit  to fund working capital requirements and a six year million term loan 
proceeds of the term note were used to repay million of existing term debt under our prior credit facility and to repurchase  shares of the cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock for million in cash plus accrued and unpaid dividends of million  net of transaction costs and related expenses 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at the prime rate plus an applicable margin or  at our option  london interbank offered rates libor plus an applicable margin 
for term loans  the applicable margin is for prime rate loans and for libor loans 
for revolving loans  the applicable margin is determined based on our leverage ratio and can range from to for prime rate loans and from to for libor loans 
the new credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and contains restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends  other than on the remaining shares of cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock  and limitations on the our ability to make acquisitions 
the new credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our direct and indirect subsidiaries

following the cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock repurchase transaction  we have issued and outstanding  shares of cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock that remain outstanding with parties other than the carlyle group 
these shares are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per preferred share 
if these shares are not previously converted  we are required to redeem these outstanding shares on september  for per preferred share plus accrued and unpaid dividends  unless such date is extended with the approval of the holders of the stock 
in addition  pursuant to a stockholders agreement with the carlyle group  we are obligated to purchase the outstanding  shares of cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock held by the carlyle group on or before september  at a minimum purchase price of per share 
we believe that cash flows from operations  cash resources at december  and  if necessary  borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating cash  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
over the longer term  our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive  and business factors 
depending upon market conditions  we may seek to supplement our capital resources with debt or equity financing 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases as of december  new accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our major market risk relates to changing interest rates 
at december   we have floating rate long term debt of million  of which the current portion is million 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective on july  partially to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates relating to our outstanding variable rate debt 
the contract s notional amount was million at inception and declines each quarter over the life of the contract in proportion to our estimated outstanding balance of the related long term debt under the prior credit facility 
additionally  the new credit facility requires us to have in place an interest rate protection arrangement for aggregate notional amount of at least of the aggregate outstanding principle amount of the term loans until june  the contract s notional amount is million at december  under the terms of the contract  we pay a fixed rate of and receive libor  which resets every days 
the contract matures on june  the fair value of the contract at december  is approximately seven thousand dollars 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to movements in interest rates 
the use of these financial instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce the risk to us as well as achieve a desired proportion of variable and fixed rate debt 
our initial strategy was to lock into a fixed rate of interest with a pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap  thereby hedging exposure to the variability in market interest rate fluctuations 
we have implemented policies which restrict the usage of derivatives to non trading purposes 
average outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit portion of the credit facility were million during the twelve months ended december  in addition  we do not have any material foreign currency or commodity risk 
since our variable rate debt was partially hedged during  a hypothetical interest rate change of would have changed interest expense by approximately million 
additionally  change in market interest rates would impact the fair value of our long term obligations
