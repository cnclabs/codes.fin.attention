the major components of the company s cost structure are the cost of rental merchandise and personnel and  to a lesser extent  occupancy  sales and marketing expense and general and administrative costs 
costs associated with rental merchandise are driven by the need to purchase merchandise to maintain the quality and availability of the product mix and to maximize inventory utilization rates

critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in applying accounting principles  management must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties 
the actual results of outcomes are generally different than the estimated or assumed amounts 
these differences are usually insignificant and are included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they are known 
the estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from these estimates 
insurance liability for workers compensation  automobile and general liability may be adjusted based on higher or lower actual loss experience 
although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these estimates because of the period over which actual results may emerge  such risk is mitigated by management s ability to make changes to these estimates as they occur 
an estimate is recorded for the future lease obligation related to closed stores based upon the present value of the future minimum lease payments and related lease commitments  net of estimated sublease income 
these estimates may be adjusted for lease terminations in which the company negotiates an amount with the landlord to terminate the lease prior to lease expiration 
also  estimated sublease reserves offsetting the obligation may become uncollectible 
management is required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making its determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  management considers the evaluation of inside counsel who consults with outside counsel knowledgeable about each matter  as well as know outcomes in case law 
see item  legal proceedings for a discussion of the key litigation matters the company faces 
the company completes  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  goodwill impairment testing  which requires a comparison of the fair value of its reporting units with their carrying amount 
this is based on discounted expected future cash flows 
the discount rate applied to these cash flows represents the company s implied cost of debt 
if the comparison of a reporting units fair value and carrying amount identifies indication of possible impairment  the company  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  determines a total enterprise value based on a combination of the market multiple  discounted cash flow and comparable transaction approaches 
this analysis is performed annually  or upon certain triggering events 
management exercises judgment about future results in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax asset after adjustment for deductible goodwill was million at september  this asset was fully offset by a valuation allowance based on management s determination that realization of the asset is uncertain 
actual results related to the estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements will emerge over periods of time 
these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
critical accounting policies revenue 
rental merchandise is rented to customers pursuant to rental agreements  which provide for either weekly  biweekly  semi monthly or monthly rental payments collected in advance 
revenue is recognized as collected  not over the rental term  since at the time of collection the rental merchandise has been placed in service and costs of installation and delivery have been incurred 
this method of revenue recognition does not produce materially different results than if rental revenue were recognized over the weekly  biweekly  semi monthly or monthly rental term 
rental merchandise and rental merchandise depreciation 
the company uses the units of activity depreciation method for all rental merchandise except computers and computer games 
under the units of activity method  rental merchandise is depreciated as revenue is collected or earned during free rent promotions 
thus  rental merchandise is not depreciated during periods when it is not on rent and therefore not generating rental revenue 
personal computers and gaming systems are principally depreciated on the straight line basis beginning on acquisition date over months to months 
write offs of rental merchandise arising from customers failure to return merchandise  obsolescence and losses due to excessive wear and tear of merchandise are recognized using the allowance method 
beginning in the three month period ended september   the company began recording rental merchandise write offs on the allowance method 
this change to the allowance method had the effect of increasing other operating expenses for a one time adjustment of approximately million to set up a rental merchandise allowance reserve on the balance sheet 
the company expects rental merchandise adjustments in the future under this new method to be materially consistent with prior year s adjustments under the direct write off method 
prepaid phone service 
prepaid phone service is provided to customers on a prepaid month to month basis 
prepaid phone service revenues are comprised of monthly service revenues and activation revenues 
monthly service revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the related monthly service period  commencing when the service period begins 
the cost of monthly service is also recognized over the monthly service period and is included in cost of prepaid phone service in the consolidated statement of operations 
activation revenues and costs are recognized on a straight line basis over the average estimated life of the customer relationship 
the company reviews the average estimated life of the customer relationship from time to time in making this determination of average estimated life 
closed store reserves 
from time to time  the company closes or consolidates stores 
an estimate is recorded of the future obligation related to closed stores based upon the present value of the future lease payments and related lease commitments  net of estimated sublease income 
if the estimates related to sublease income are not correct  the actual liability may be more or less than the liability recorded  and the company adjusts the liability accordingly 
health insurance program 
the company determines insurance liability based on funding factors determined by cost plus rates for a fully insured plan and monthly headcount 
the contracted rate is determined based on experience  prior claims filed and an estimate of future claims 
a retrospective adjustment for over under funding of claims is recorded when determinable and probable 
liability insurance programs 
starting in  the insurance liability for workers compensation  automobile and general liability costs are determined based on claims filed and company experience 
losses in the workers compensation  automobile and general liability programs are pre funded based on the insurance company s loss estimates 
loss estimates will be adjusted for developed incurred losses at months following policy inception and every months thereafter 
retrospective adjustments to loss estimates are recorded when determinable and probable 
for fiscal years and  the company was insured under deductible programs with aggregate stop loss coverage on major claims 
claims within the insured deductible limits that were less than stop loss aggregates  were funded as claims developed using am best loss development factors 
the fiscal worker s compensation insurance had no aggregate retention and was funded as claims developed using am best loss development factors 
goodwill 
effective october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that intangible assets not subject to amortization and goodwill be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the annual impairment testing consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the total enterprise value  as determined by an independent valuation firm  represents a combination of the market multiple  discounted cash flow and comparable transaction approaches 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  including such assets recorded in past business combinations  ceased upon adoption 
thus  no amortization for such goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles was recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years ended september   and during the quarter ended september   the company calculated an impairment to goodwill of million  recorded in cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the amount of million net of million in income taxes 
for the years ended september  and  there was no impairment of goodwill

same store revenues consists of revenues from stores in the household rental segment that have been operating for more than fifteen months and have had no changes affecting operations during that time  ie mergers  dispositions or acquisitions

thus  rental merchandise is not depreciated during periods when it is not on rent and therefore not generating rental revenue

as a result  the company may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future 
the financial covenants required under the credit facility are as follows the leverage ratio is total funded debt less an amount on deposit in the excess cash flow escrow account to ebitda for the four fiscal quarters then ended

seasonality and inflation 
the company s operating results are subject to seasonality 
the first quarter typically has a greater number of rental purchase agreements entered into because of traditional holiday shopping patterns 
management plans for these seasonal variances and takes particular advantage of the first quarter with product promotions and marketing campaigns 
because many of the company s expenses do not fluctuate with seasonal revenue changes  such revenue changes may cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly earnings 
in the event of a prolonged recession  the company acknowledges the possibility of a decrease in demand  particularly for higher end products 
during the year ended september   the costs of rental merchandise  store lease rental expense and salaries and wages have increased modestly 
these increases have not had a significant effect on the company s results of operations because the company has been able to charge commensurately higher rental for its merchandise 
this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future

this interpretation is effective for financial statements for periods after march  the company has no variable interest entities that are not currently consolidated

on october   the fasb concluded that statement r  share based payment  would be effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  the company does not know how the provisions of this proposed statement will effect financial statements of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to changes in short term interest rates  particularly to reduce the impact on floating rate borrowings under its revolving credit facility  by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
these swap agreements involve the receipt of amounts by the company when floating rates exceed fixed rates and the payment of amounts by the company to the counter parties when fixed rates exceed the floating rates in the agreements over their term 
the company accrues the differential as interest rates change  and recognizes it as an adjustment to the floating rate interest expense related to the debt 
the counter parties to these contracts are high credit quality commercial banks  which the company believes minimizes the risk of counter party default  to a large extent 
at september   the company had swap agreements with total notional principal amounts of million  which effectively fixed the interest rate on obligations of debt under the million revolving credit facility 
the swap agreements lock in a libor rate ranging from to and have maturities through falling interest rates and or a flattening of the yield curve will negatively impact the market value of the interest rate swaps 
changes in the valuation of such swap agreements are recorded directly to earnings 
the face value of interest rate swap agreements was a liability of approximately million at september  a adverse change in the interest rates on variable rate obligations would affect pre tax earnings by approximately million 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of june   the company is over hedged because of the refinancing 
the existing interest rate swaps hedged a portion of the previous libor debt 
as a result of the refinancing  the only libor debt the company has is the million revolving credit facility  of which million was outstanding at september  the company will reduce its interest rate swap position as they mature through august  rather than terminate these agreements early because of the current high cost to terminate
