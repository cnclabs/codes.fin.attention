income from discontinued operations increased million due to the timing of property sales in and funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit to be an appropriate supplemental disclosure of operating performance for an equity reit due to its widespread acceptance and use within the reit and analyst communities 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the company 
it is helpful as it excludes various items included in net income that are not indicative of the operating performance  such as gains or losses from sales of property and depreciation and amortization 
however  the company s method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash needs  including distributions 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income for the purpose of evaluating the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity

the company historically had added back impairments in real estate in calculating ffo  in accordance with prior nareit guidance 
however  nareit  based on discussions with the sec  has provided revised guidance that provides that impairments should not be added back to net income in calculating ffo 
as such  historical ffo has been restated consistent with this revised guidance 
the reconciliations of net income to ffo for the years ended december     and are as follows reconciliation of net income to funds from operations for the years ended december  net income      depreciation of real estate and amortization of leasing costs wholly owned and consolidated partnerships   unconsolidated partnerships  income attributable to minority interest   gain loss on sale of properties    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle funds from operations      notes represents income attributable to common operating partnership units and does not include distributions paid on preferred op units

back to contents historical cash flow the following discussion of historical cash flow compares the company s cash flow for the year ended december  with the company s cash flow for the year ended december  
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease of million was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows amounts in millions years ended december  variance net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by discontinued operations the variance in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to million of lease termination income received in which was not repeated in in addition  there was a net decrease in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  primarily rents receivable

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used by the company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
valuation of property held for use and sale on a quarterly basis  the company reviews the carrying value of both properties held for use and for sale 
the company records impairment losses and reduces the carrying value of properties when indicators of impairment are present and the expected undiscounted cash flows related to those properties are less than their carrying amounts 
in cases where the company does not expect to recover its carrying costs on properties held for use  the company reduces its carrying cost to fair value  and for properties held for sale  the company reduces its carrying value to the fair value less costs to sell 
for the years ended december  and  impairment losses of  and million were recognized related to properties which were held for sale and subsequently sold 
management does not believe that the values of any properties in its portfolio are impaired as of december  bad debts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make payments on arrearages in billed rents  as well as the likelihood that tenants will not have the ability to make payment on unbilled rents including estimated expense recoveries and straight line rent 
as of december   the company had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of the company s tenants were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

back to contents inflation the company s long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on the company s net income 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indexes 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents upon re rental at market rates if current rents are below the then existing market rates 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting statements board fasb issued fasb interpretation no

fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january in general  a variable interest entity vie is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a vie often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a vie may be essentially passive or it may engage in activities on behalf of another company 
until now  a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a vie to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the company will be required to adopt fin r in the first fiscal period beginning after march  upon adoption of fin r  the assets  liabilities and non controlling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie 
it is not anticipated that the effect on the company s consolidated financial statements would be material
