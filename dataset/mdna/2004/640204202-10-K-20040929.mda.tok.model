overview of the company s business the company believes that its unique product assortment of luxury  designer and fashion merchandise  coupled with its sales promotion activities and its commitment to superior customer service  have been critical to the company s success in the past 
in addition  the company believes these factors are critical to the company s future growth and success 
the company conducts its selling activities in two primary selling seasons fall and spring 
the fall season is comprised of the company s first and second fiscal quarters and the spring season is comprised of the company s third and fourth fiscal quarters 
the first quarter is generally characterized by a higher level of full price selling with a focus on the initial introduction of fall season fashions 
aggressive in store marketing activities designed to stimulate customer buying  a lower level of markdowns and higher margins are characteristic of this quarter 
the second quarter is more focused on promotional activities related to the december holiday season  the early introduction of resort season collections from certain designers and the sale of fall season goods on a marked down basis 
as a result  margins are typically lower in the second quarter 
however  due to the seasonal increase in sales that occurs during the holiday season  the second quarter is typically the quarter in which the company s sales are the highest and in which expenses are the lowest as a percentage of revenues 
the company s working capital requirements are also the greatest in the first and second quarters as a result of higher seasonal levels of accounts receivables and inventory 
similarly  the third quarter is generally characterized by a higher level of full price selling with a focus on the initial introduction of spring season fashions 
aggressive in store marketing activities designed to stimulate customer buying  a lower level of markdowns and higher margins are again characteristic of this quarter 
sales are generally the lowest in the fourth quarter and are focused on promotional activities offering spring season goods to the customer on a marked down basis  resulting in lower margins during the quarter 
a large percentage of the company s merchandise assortment  particularly in the apparel  fashion accessories and shoe categories is ordered months in advance of the introduction of such goods 
for example  women s apparel  men s apparel and shoes are typically ordered months in advance of the products being offered for sale while handbags  jewelry and other categories are typically ordered months in advance 
as a result  inherent in the company s successful execution of its business plans is its ability both to predict the fashion trends that will be of interest to its customers and to anticipate future spending patterns of its customer base 
the company monitors the sales performance of its inventories throughout each season 
the company seeks to order additional goods to supplement its original purchasing decisions when the level of customer demand is higher than originally anticipated 
however  in certain merchandise categories  particularly fashion apparel  the company s ability to purchase additional goods can be limited 
this can result in lost sales to the company in the event of higher than anticipated demand of the fashion goods offered by the company or a higher than anticipated level of consumer spending 
conversely  in the event the company buys fashion goods that are not accepted by the customer or the level of consumer spending is less than the company anticipated  the company typically incurs a higher than anticipated level of markdowns  net of vendor allowances  to sell the goods that remain at the end of the season  resulting in lower operating profits 
the company believes that the experience of its merchandising and selling organizations helps to minimize the inherent risk in predicting fashion trends

these forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and  therefore  are not guarantees of future performance 
a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the anticipated or expected results expressed in these forward looking statements

critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts currently estimated by the company are subject to change if different assumptions as to the outcome of future events were made 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicates those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management makes adjustments to its assumptions and judgments when facts and circumstances dictate 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results may differ from the estimates used by the company in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management of the company believes the following critical accounting policies encompass the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenues 
revenues include sales of merchandise and services  net commissions earned from leased departments in the company s retail stores and shipping and handling revenues related to merchandise sold 
revenues from the company s retail operations are recognized at the later of the point of sale or the delivery of goods to the customer 
revenues from the company s direct marketing operation are recognized when the merchandise is delivered to the customer 
the company maintains reserves for anticipated sales returns primarily based on the company s historical trends related to returns by its retail and direct marketing customers 
merchandise inventories and cost of goods sold 
the company utilizes the retail method of accounting for substantially all of its merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the retail inventory method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio  for various groupings of similar items  to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on the consolidated balance sheet is decreased by charges to cost of goods sold at the time the retail value of the inventory is lowered through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted when merchandise is marked down 
the areas requiring significant management judgment related to the valuation of the company s inventories include setting the original retail value for the merchandise held for sale  recognizing merchandise for which the customer s perception of value has declined and appropriately marking the retail value of the merchandise down to the perceived value and estimating the shrinkage that has occurred between physical inventory counts 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the averaging processes within the retail method can  under certain circumstances  produce varying financial results 
factors that can lead to different financial results include setting original retail values for merchandise held for sale incorrectly  failure to identify a decline in perceived value of inventories and process the appropriate retail value markdowns and overly optimistic or conservative shrinkage estimates 
the company believes it has the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that its inventory values would be materially misstated 
consistent with industry business practice  the company receives allowances from certain of its vendors in support of the merchandise purchased by the company for resale 
certain allowances are received to reimburse the company for markdowns taken and or to support the gross margins earned by the company in connection with the sales of the vendor s merchandise 
these allowances result in an increase to gross margin when the allowances are earned by the company and approved by the vendor 
other allowances received by the company represent reductions to the amounts paid by the company to acquire the merchandise 
these allowances reduce the cost of the acquired merchandise and are recognized as an increase to gross margin at the time the goods are sold 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable primarily consist of the company s proprietary credit card receivables  third party credit card receivables and the net trade receivables of the brand development companies 
the company extends credit to certain of its customers pursuant to its proprietary retail credit card program 
the company s credit operations generate finance charge income  which is recognized as income when earned and is recorded as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number of customers to whom the company extends credit 
ongoing evaluation of customers credit is performed and collateral is not required as a condition of extending credit 
the company maintains reserves for potential credit losses 
the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including analysis of historical trends  aging of accounts receivable  write off experience and expectations of future performance 
long lived assets 
to the extent the company remodels or otherwise replaces or disposes of property and equipment prior to the end of the assigned depreciable lives  the company could realize a loss or gain on the disposition 
to the extent assets continue to be used beyond their assigned depreciable lives  no depreciation expense is incurred 
the company reassesses the depreciable lives of its long lived assets in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains at disposition and utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
the reassessment of depreciable lives involves utilizing historical remodel and disposition activity and forward looking capital expenditure plans 
recoverability of the carrying value of store assets is assessed annually and upon the occurrence of certain events eg  opening a new store near an existing store or announcing plans for a store closing 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates for future store generated cash flows 
the underlying estimates of cash flows include estimates of future revenues  gross margin rates and store expenses and are based upon the stores past and expected future performance 
new stores may require two to five years to develop a customer base necessary to generate the cash flows of the company s more mature stores 
to the extent management s estimates for revenue growth and gross margin improvement are not realized  future annual assessments could result in impairment charges 
recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets is assessed annually and upon the occurrence of certain events 
the recoverability assessment requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the fair values 
the fair values are determined using estimated future cash flows  including growth assumptions for future revenues  gross margin rates and other estimates 
to the extent that management s estimates are not realized  future assessments could result in impairment charges 
advertising and catalog costs 
the company incurs costs to advertise and promote the merchandise assortment offered by both specialty retail stores and direct marketing 
advertising costs incurred by the specialty retail stores consist primarily of print media costs related to promotional materials mailed to its customers 
these costs are expensed at the time of mailing to the customer 
advertising costs incurred by direct marketing relate to the production  printing and distribution of its print catalogs and the production of the photographic content on its websites 
the costs of print catalogs are amortized during the periods the expected revenues from such catalogs are expected to be generated  generally three to six months 
the costs incurred to produce the photographic content on the company s websites are expensed at the time the images are first loaded onto the website 
website design costs are expensed as incurred 
loyalty programs 
the company maintains customer loyalty programs in which customers receive points annually for qualifying purchases 
upon reaching certain levels  customers may redeem their points for gifts 
generally  points earned in a given year must be redeemed no later than ninety days subsequent to the end of the annual program period 
the company accrues the estimated costs of the anticipated redemptions of the points earned by its customers at the time of the initial customer purchase and charges such costs to selling  general and administrative expense 
the estimates of the costs associated with the loyalty programs require the company to make assumptions related to customer purchasing levels  redemption rates and costs of awards to be chosen by its customers 
pension plan 
the company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all full time employees 
in calculating its pension obligations and related pension expense  the company makes various assumptions and estimates  after consulting with outside actuaries and advisors 
the annual determination of pension expense involves calculating the estimated total benefits ultimately payable to plan participants and allocating this cost to the periods in which services are expected to be rendered 
the company uses the projected unit credit method in recognizing pension liabilities 
the pension plan is valued annually as of the beginning of each fiscal year 
significant assumptions related to the calculation of the company s pension obligation include the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future  the expected long term rate of return on assets held by the pension plan and the average rate of compensation increase by plan participants 
these actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually based upon currently available information 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based  in part  upon the moody s aa corporate bond yield as of the measurement date 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of the company s pension obligation and net pension expense 
at july   the discount rate was percent 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s pension obligation is decreased or increased  accordingly 
the estimated effect of a percent decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension obligation by million and increase annual pension expense by million 
the assumed expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the pension obligation 
in  the company s target allocation is to invest the pension plan assets in equity securities approximately percent and in fixed income securities approximately percent 
the company periodically evaluates the allocation between investment categories of the assets held by the pension plan 
the expected average long term rate of return on assets is based principally on the counsel of the company s outside actuaries and advisors 
this rate is utilized primarily in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this gain reduces future pension expense over a period of approximately to years 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is likewise not affected 
rather  this loss increases pension expense over approximately to years 
during  the company utilized percent as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees 
the company utilized a rate of percent for the periods beginning august  this rate is utilized principally in calculating the pension obligation and annual pension expense 
the estimated effect of a percent increase in the assumed rate of compensation increase would increase the pension obligation by million and increase annual pension expense by million 
the company had cumulative unrecognized expense for the pension plan of million at august  primarily related to the delayed recognition of differences between the company s actuarial assumptions and actual results 
self insurance and other employee benefit reserves 
management uses estimates in the determination of the required accruals for general liability  workers compensation and health insurance as well as short term disability  supplemental executive retirement benefits and postretirement health care benefits 
these estimates are based upon an examination of historical trends  industry claims experience and  in certain cases  calculations performed by third party experts 
projected claims information may change in the future and may require management to revise these accruals 
income taxes 
the company is routinely under audit by federal  state or local authorities in the areas of income taxes 
these audits include questioning the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company accrues charges for probable exposures 
based on its annual evaluations of tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of recorded reserves  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially impacted 
litigation 
the company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential range of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each significant legal action 
the company s accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters
