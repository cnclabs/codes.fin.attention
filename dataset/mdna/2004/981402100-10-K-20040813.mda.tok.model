overview we are a provider of services and web based software for human capital management hcm 
hcm is the process by which companies recruit  train  evaluate  motivate and retain their employees 
we offer software and services that address the needs of companies to more effectively manage their human capital management function 
we believe that our one stop shopping approach for our clients hcm needs is more efficient and effective than traditional methods of human resource management 
we have two distinct operating segments  which are the enterprise workforce services and career transition services segments 
the enterprise workforce services segment consists of recruiting systems  recruitment services  applicant sourcing and exchange  employee portal  performance management systems services and compensation management systems services 
the career transition services segment consists of outplacement services 
our business changed significantly beginning in fiscal during the first six months of fiscal  we completed the acquisition of paula allen holdings  omnipartners  figurejobs 
com  rezlogic  resumexpress and tech engine 
during the first six months of fiscal we completed the acquisition of icarian  purecarbon and xylo 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of perform  peopleview and kadiri 
subsequent to the acquisitions  we have concentrated on integrating the acquired entities and expanding the reach of the existing business 
these acquisitions have enabled us to increase our service offerings and revenue streams 
due to the substantive change these acquisitions have made to our business  this management s discussion and analysis includes comparisons of pro forma results of operations for fiscal and fiscal these pro forma results assume that the significant acquisitions kadiri had been completed as at june  and therefore compare revenues and expenses of us and all our subsidiaries for both fiscal years 
to monitor our results of operations and financial condition  we review key financial information including net revenues  gross profit  earnings per share  and cash flow from operations 
as our businesses are integrated  we continue to seek ways to more efficiently manage and monitor our business performance 
we review other key operating metrics such as sales per employee  days of sales outstanding  liquidity ratio  and debt to equity ratio in addition  we review the number of clients and revenue per client in both the enterprise workforce services and career transition services segments  and the number of listings in our applicant sourcing and exchange business 
as our business is impacted by the job market  we also review economic indicators such as the unemployment rate 
critical accounting policies our most critical accounting policies relate to the assessment of goodwill impairment  impairments in intangible assets and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
management applies judgment to value these assets 
changes in assumptions used would impact our financial results 
goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
we assess goodwill related to reporting units for impairment  and write down the carrying amount of goodwill as required 
we estimate the fair value of each business unit by preparing a discounted cash flow model  using a discount rate 
the model is prepared by projecting results for five years making different assumptions for each business unit 
we assumed that the economy would continue to improve in fiscal  that individual business unit revenue growth rates would range from to  that gross profit would generally be higher than current trends  and that operating expense would be reduced 
an impairment charge is recorded if the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the book value of goodwill for that unit 
changes in the discount rate used  or in other assumptions in the model  would result in wide fluctuations in the value of goodwill that is supported 
any such changes may result in additional impairment write downs 
days of sales outstanding represents both the age  in terms of days  of a company s accounts receivable and the average time it takes to turn the receivables into cash 
it is calculated by dividing accounts receivables by daily revenue 
daily revenue is calculated by dividing revenue for a month by the number of days in that month 
liquidity ratio represents the number of times that current assets can cover current liabilities and it is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities 
debt to equity ratio represents the level of debt in relation to shareholders equity measuring a company s financial leverage 
the ratio is calculated by dividing total liabilities by shareholders equity 
we value intangible assets  such as a customer base acquired in an acquisition  based on estimated future income applying historical customer retention rates 
if the customer base acquired discontinues using our service earlier than historical experience  we may be required to record an impairment of intangible assets 
changes in circumstances impacting other assumptions used to value intangible assets could also lead to future impairments 
we apply significant judgment in recording net deferred tax assets  which result from the loss carry forwards of companies that we acquire 
the recording of deferred tax assets requires estimates of future profits from the acquired company to be forecast 
actual results may differ from amounts estimated 
the table below sets forth pro forma results and the percentage difference between fiscal year and fiscal year  assuming that the kadiri acquisition was acquired at the beginning of fiscal workstream inc unaudited pro forma statement of operations united states dollars proforma proforma fy fy variance change revenue    cost of revenue    gross profit    selling and marketing    general and administrative    research and development    amortization and depreciation    impairment write down of goodwill   operating loss    interest and other income    interest and other expense    recovery of deferred income taxes    current income tax expense recovery    net loss for the year    weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year   basic and diluted net loss per common share our revenues have declined on a pro forma basis for fiscal due primarily to a reduction in revenue for kadiri as a result of deferral of revenue due to the timing of the sales completed and additional work needed to complete the project 
additionally  pro forma revenues declined as a result of the closure of the career transition services offices in the first six months of fiscal  the closure of seven offices in fiscal and a change in marketing strategy 
in addition  pro forma revenue declined in recruiting research and some sectors of recruiting software which we believe is due in part to the weak job market and the transition of icarian clients from our icarian software to our e cruiter software  which is more economical for the client but results in greater profits as a percentage of sales for workstream 
following completion of the fiscal  fiscal and fiscal acquisitions  we focused on integrating the acquired entities and expanding the reach of the existing businesses 
we have also made efforts to reduce costs by consolidating operations  resulting in staff reductions of redundant positions and related overhead and reducing research and development expenditures 
certain actions taken to reduce costs  such as the closure of offices and a change in our marketing strategy  have also caused reductions in revenue 
we have shifted our marketing strategy from advertising in newspapers to advertising on the internet 
while this has resulted in reduced revenue due to fewer sales  we believe that it is more profitable because it is easier to manage and less costly than advertising in newspapers 
in fiscal  operating expenses of non acquired operations declined  including an advertising expense decline of  and a decline of  related to the closure of offices 
we believe that the impact of a full year of reduction in costs will continue to impact results in the near term for existing operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues consolidated revenues were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
fiscal revenues from companies we acquired during fiscal represented  for the year ended may  revenues other than from companies we acquired in fiscal declined to  from  in fiscal mainly due to a decrease in career transition service revenues  lower caused by our closure of seven office locations in fiscal and the timing of our closure of four office locations in fiscal  as well as lower sales as a result of a change in marketing strategy initiated during the last six months of fiscal enterprise workforce services revenues other than those resulting from acquisitions decreased in fiscal by  from fiscal mainly due to a decline in sales in recruitment research and some sectors of recruitment software which we believe was due in part to the weak job market and the transition of our clients from our higher priced icarian product to our less expensive e cruiter software 
the e cruiter software is less costly for us to maintain than the icarian software and therefore generates higher gross profits as a percentage of sales for us 
career transition services revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the major reason for the decline in career transition services revenues was due to our closure of seven office locations during fiscal and the timing of the closure of four office locations during fiscal  as well as lower sales as a result of a change in marketing strategy 
enterprise workforce services revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
 of revenues for fiscal was contributed by the acquisitions made in fiscal this increase as a result of acquisitions was partially offset by a decline in sales in recruiting research and some sectors of recruiting software which we believe is due in part to the weak job market and the transition of icarian clients from our icarian software to our e cruiter software  which is less expensive for the client but results in a greater profit as a percentage of sales for workstream 
pro forma revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decline in pro forma revenues is primarily due to a reduction of  in revenue for kadiri due to the deferral of revenue as a result of the timing of the sales completed and additional work needed to complete the project 
additionally  pro forma revenues declined  as a result of the timing of the closure of the career transition services offices during fiscal and fiscal and a change in marketing strategy initiated during the last six months of fiscal during fiscal  the amount of sales per employee decreased to  compared to  per employee for fiscal due to the addition of kadiri s employees to such calculation without recognizing any revenue for kadiri during fiscal since the acquisition took place on the last business day of our fiscal year 
sales per employee excluding kadiri employees were  a decrease of  sales per employee 
we believe that the decrease is due mainly to the timing of the closure of the offices in the career transition services segment and lower revenues in the enterprise workforce services segment 
by the end of fiscal  the total number of clients for our software services  consisting of our recruitment systems  performance management and employee portal were at the same level since may  at the end of fiscal  the total number of clients for our career transition services decreased by since may  as a result of the timing our closure of offices mostly done during the first six months of fiscal the number of job postings in our applicant sourcing and exchange business remained at approximately the same level throughout fiscal by the end of fiscal  our revenue per client for our software services  consisting of our recruitment systems  performance management and employee portal services increased since may  we believe that the increase in revenue per client is primarily attributable to the higher revenue generating clients we obtained through the businesses we acquired during fiscal our revenue per client for our career transition services increased approximately from may  as a result of our efforts to improve our level of service by having better qualified staff involved in the delivery of the services and by automating the production process 
these revenue per client figures are calculated by dividing monthly revenue by the number of clients serviced during the month 
we believe that our business is impacted by the job market 
the unemployment rate as of may  was  improving from a for may  but still significantly higher than the pre recession rate of for december when businesses reduce the number of employees being hired  as evidenced by a higher unemployment rate  we believe that the demand for our services decreases mainly in the areas of our recruitment software and recruitment services 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
cost of revenues includes the cost of network operations  client support and charges related to third party services 
career transition services cost of revenues accounted for  and enterprise workforce services cost of revenues accounted for  of the total cost of revenues for fiscal cost of revenues in the enterprise workforce services segment decreased  from fiscal as a result of the elimination of redundant operations 
cost of revenues for the career transition services segment decreased  from fiscal as a result of reduction of staffing in an effort to improve productivity through automation 
on a pro forma basis  cost of revenues decreased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or mainly due to workstream s elimination of redundant operations and improved productivity 
the decrease was partially offset by a  increase in the cost of revenues of kadiri s operations as a result of hosting costs not incurred in the prior year  an increase in technical and customer support costs incurred to support a larger customer base  and higher implementation costs due to outsourcing of those services 
gross profits consolidated gross profits were  for fiscal or of revenues compared to  or of revenues for fiscal career transition services gross profit was  or of career transition service revenues compared to  or of career transition services revenues for fiscal enterprise workforce services gross profit was  or of enterprise workforce services for fiscal compared to  or approximately of enterprise workforce services revenues for fiscal the improvement in gross profit as a percent of revenues is due to the efforts to eliminate redundant operations and costs and to pursue more profitable business by shifting to more profitable products and changing marketing strategies resulting in sales with higher gross margins 
pro forma gross profits were  or of revenues for fiscal compared to  or of revenues for fiscal pro forma gross profits remained at the same level as a result of workstream s efforts to eliminate redundant operations and costs and the pursuit of more profitable business  offset by kadiri s increased costs of revenues due to added hosting costs  a shift to higher costs incurred through the outsourcing of implementation and higher technical and customer support costs 
operating expenses total operating expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
acquisitions completed in fiscal accounted for  in total operating expenses 
operating expenses for non acquired operations were  for fiscal  representing an approximate decline compared to fiscal the primary reason for the decline in operating expenses for the operations that existed prior to the fiscal acquisitions is the consolidation of operating functions and the impairment of goodwill recorded in fiscal goodwill impairment for non acquired operations declined  from fiscal to fiscal non acquired operating expenses excluding goodwill declined   of which was from moving our advertising from newspapers to the internet   of which was from reducing our internal research and development expenses and the balance mainly as a result of consolidating operations 
we believe that operating expenses generally continue to increase in the first three to twelve months after we complete an acquisition but that operating expenses will decrease after that as a result of the consolidation of operations 
any future acquisition will increase operating expenses from the date of acquisition  in which case we believe that pro forma results would provide a more comparable analysis 
on a pro forma basis  operating expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decline in pro forma operating expense is due mainly to the elimination of redundant costs in the operations excluding kadiri  and the impairment of goodwill recorded in fiscal kadiri s operating expenses increased  due to mainly to an increase of  in selling and marketing expenses and an increase of  in research and development 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decline of  or 
this decrease is attributed mainly to a reduction of  in advertising expense for existing operations  a reduction of  in sales and marketing employee costs for existing operations due to the consolidation of operations resulting in the hiring of fewer sales and marketing personnel as well as the transitioning of sales and marketing positions to our headquarters in ottawa  canada where we have replaced positions at lower salaries  and a reduction of  in sales and marketing travel and entertainment 
advertising expense was reduced by  in the career transition services segment by shifting advertising from newspapers and print media to the internet 
in addition  advertising expense was reduced in the enterprise workforce services segment by  due to a reduction of online advertising mainly for our applicant sourcing and exchange business 
on a pro forma basis  selling and marketing expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decline in selling and marketing expenses was mainly due to reductions in operations other than kadiri  in advertising  employee and travel and entertainment as explained above 
this decline was partially offset by an increase of  in the kadiri operations as a result of an increase in marketing expense in efforts to create market awareness and the promotion of new product 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the acquisitions made in fiscal  contributed  of this increase mainly for employee costs  rent and communication expense 
general and administrative expenses for existing operations increased  due principally to an increase of  in employee costs due to an increase in personnel at our headquarters in ottawa  canada  in corporate support functions  a  increase in professional fees as a result of agreements entered this year for consulting services  and an increase of  in travel and entertainment 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenses due to the consolidation of operations in areas such as rent expense a decrease of  communication expense a decrease of  computing expense a decrease of 
in addition  expenses decreased due to a reduction of  net of recoveries  as a result of better collection efforts  as well as due to credits related to the recovery and settlement of claims with vendors that arose prior to the icarian acquisition  and the reversal of pre acquisition accounts payable balances of icarian determined not to be outstanding 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the first three to twelve months after we complete an acquisition but that general and administrative expenses will decrease after that as a result of our effort to eliminate redundant costs 
any future acquisitions will increase general and administrative expenses from the date of the acquisition  in which case we believe that proforma results would provide a more comparable analysis 
on a pro forma basis  general and administrative expenses increased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase is mainly due to additional expense of  incurred as a result of the acquisitions of peopleview and perform in the form of employee costs  rent and communication and an increase of  for existing operations as explained above 
research and development research and development costs were  for fiscal and  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
 of the research and development costs incurred in fiscal was attributable to the operations that we acquired in fiscal the overall decline in research and development costs is primarily due to our strategy to acquire new technology through acquisitions 
we believe that we can acquire new technology at a lower cost in the long term and more efficiently than developing new software platforms with internal resources 
we implemented this strategy in fiscal since fiscal most of our research and development efforts have been incurred in the enterprise workforce services segment 
on a pro forma basis  research and development expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase is mainly due to an increase of  in the kadiri operations as a result of higher staffing and consulting costs due to release of new product in the increase was offset by lower research and development expense in operations other than kadiri due to our strategy to acquire new technology through acquisitions 
amortization and depreciation expense amortization and depreciation expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease is due to a decrease of  in depreciation expense due to lower computer equipment and leasehold improvement expense as a result of the disposal of certain assets in connection with the termination of a lease of certain real property formerly leased to icarian and certain other assets becoming fully amortized 
the decrease in depreciation is partially offset by an increase of  in amortization of intangibles as a result of the timing of the acquisitions completed in fiscal and fiscal amortization and depreciation expense for the enterprise workforce services segment increased  mainly as a result of the increase in amortization due to the timing of the acquisitions completed in fiscal and fiscal partially offset by the disposal and full amortization of the assets as discussed above 
in fiscal  the career transition services segment s amortization and depreciation expense increased by  during fiscal  through the acquisitions of perform  peopleview and kadiri we acquired capital assets of  and intangible assets of  the amortization of these acquired assets is based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
on a pro forma basis  amortization and depreciation expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decline in amortization and depreciation expense on a pro forma basis was due primarily to lower computer equipment and leasehold improvement expense related to the disposal of assets and assets becoming fully amortized  partially offset by additional amortization of intangibles as a result of the timing of the acquisitions completed in fiscal and fiscal interest income and other income interest and other income was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decline was due to lower average short term investment and restricted cash balances throughout fiscal interest expense and other expense interest and other expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the primary reason for the increase in interest and other expense was due to a non recurring increase of  incurred as a result of the non cash charge for amortization of the discount related to the conversion of  of our senior subordinated convertible notes and the accretion of the notes to their full face value during the third quarter of this increase was partially offset by a decrease of  in interest expense due to the timing of the conversion of the senior subordinated convertible notes and the payment of a certain shareholder note 
goodwill goodwill was  as of may  compared to  as of may   an increase of  or 
 of the increase relates to the kadiri acquisition completed during fiscal  and  of the increase was due as a result of additional liabilities for a tax assessment and a claim with a vendor related to periods prior to the acquisitions and recorded as part of the purchase equation within twelve months after the acquisition in accordance with fasb management recorded during fiscal and fiscal  goodwill impairment charges totaling nil and  respectively  related to the icarian  rezlogic and tech engine acquisitions 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues consolidated revenues were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
fiscal revenues from companies we acquired during fiscal represented  for the year ended may  revenues other than from companies we acquired in fiscal declined to  from  in fiscal mainly due to lower career transition service revenues lower from fiscal caused by our consolidation of office locations and lower enterprise workforce services revenues lower from fiscal 
we believe that enterprise workforce services revenues other than those resulting from acquisitions decreased in fiscal as a result of the continued softness in the economy which we believe has led to fewer companies hiring additional staff 
career transition services revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal the major reason for the decline in career transition services revenues was due to the closure of two office locations in the fourth quarter of fiscal and four office locations in the first six months of fiscal these closures are a result of our plan to consolidate sales locations and develop larger centers in fewer locations in order to leverage management costs and improve internal controls 
enterprise workforce services revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the acquisition of icarian  purecarbon  and xylo in fiscal this increase was partially offset by a decline in sales in recruiting research and some sectors of recruiting software which we believe is due to the weak economy 
we believe that the acquisitions we made in fiscal and fiscal allow us to deliver a broader range of recruiting and outplacement products and services through our offices across north america 
management believes that the acquisitions will have a significant impact on future revenues 
during fiscal  the amount of sales per employee increased to  compared to  per employee for fiscal we believe that this increase reflects the integration of the businesses acquired  our efforts to improve efficiencies and the elimination of redundant positions 
by the end of fiscal  the total number of clients for our software services  consisting of our recruitment systems services and our employee portal services  had increased by since june we believe that the increase in the total number of clients is primarily attributable to the additional clients we obtained through the businesses we acquired during fiscal at the end of fiscal  the total number of clients for our career transition services decreased by since june as a result of the closing of offices and change in marketing strategy 
the number of job postings in our applicant sourcing and exchange business remained at approximately the same level throughout fiscal by the end of fiscal  our revenue per client for our software services  consisting of our recruitment systems services and our employee portal services  had increased by since june we believe that the increase in revenue per client is primarily attributable to the higher revenue generating clients we obtained through the businesses we acquired during fiscal our revenue per client for our career transition services remained at approximately the same level throughout fiscal these revenue per client figures are calculated by dividing monthly revenue by the number of clients serviced during the month 
we believe that our business is impacted by the job market 
the unemployment rate as of may  was  a level not seen since july  and significantly higher than the pre recession rate of for december when businesses reduce the number of employees being hired  as evidenced by a higher unemployment rate  we believe that the demand for our services decreases mainly in the areas of our recruitment software and recruitment research services 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or

career transition services cost of revenues accounted for  and enterprise workforce services cost of revenues accounted for  of the total cost of revenues for fiscal cost of revenues in the enterprise workforce services segment increased  from fiscal the acquisitions done in fiscal contributed  to this increase which was partially offset by reduced costs as a result of an effort to eliminate redundant operations 
cost of revenues for the career transition services segment decreased  from fiscal gross profits consolidated gross profits were  for fiscal or of revenues compared to  or for fiscal career transition services gross profit was  or of career transition services revenues for fiscal compared to  or of career transition service revenues for fiscal in the career transition services segment  although cost of revenues has been reduced  the timing of the reduction of costs in relation to the loss of revenue in the closed offices has resulted in a slight decrease in its gross profit margin 
enterprise workforce services gross profit was  or approximately of enterprise workforce services revenues for fiscal compared to  or of enterprise workforce service revenues for fiscal as mentioned above  the reduction in redundant costs in the enterprise workforce services segment has improved gross profit margins compared to the prior year 
operating expenses total operating expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or

operating expenses for non acquired operations were  for fiscal  representing an approximate decline compared to fiscal the primary reason for the decline in operating expenses for the operations that existed prior to the fiscal acquisitions is the consolidation of operating functions and the impairment of goodwill recorded in fiscal goodwill impairment for non acquired operations declined  from fiscal to fiscal non acquired operating expenses declined   of which was from moving our advertising from newspapers to the internet and the balance mainly as a result of consolidating operations 
we believe that operating expenses generally continue to increase in the first three to twelve months after we complete an acquisition but that operating expenses will decrease after that as a result of the consolidation of operations 
any future acquisition will increase operating expenses from the date of acquisition  in which case we believe that pro forma results would provide a more comparable analysis 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decline of  or 
this decrease is attributed mainly to a reduction in advertising expense  and a reduction in employee costs for existing operations  partially offset by an increase in employee costs as a result of the acquisitions made in fiscal 
advertising expense was reduced by  in the career transition services segment by shifting advertising from newspapers and print media to the internet 
in addition  advertising expense was reduced in the enterprise workforce services segment by  by implementing a more direct sales approach compared to an indirect approach used by prior management of the acquired operations and initially continued after the acquisitions 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or  due principally to increased employee costs  space occupancy  equipment leasing costs  computing and communication expense  bad debt expense  postage  and professional fees  related to the companies we acquired during fiscal  as well as director fees for serving on our board  higher audit and accounting fees  and the impact of a full year of costs from the acquisitions made in fiscal research and development research and development costs were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or mainly as a result of  of research and development costs  most of which was in the form of employee expenses incurred by icarian  purecarbon and xylo during the first six to twelve months after we acquired them 
as the acquired companies are integrated into our operations  we expect to reduce their research and development costs by reducing or eliminating those positions or activities dedicated to research and development 
during fiscal  research and development costs of our existing operations declined by  or  as a result of our strategy to acquire technology through acquisitions 
we believe that we can acquire new technology at a lower cost in the long term and more efficiently than developing new software platforms with internal resources 
we implemented this strategy in fiscal since fiscal most of our research and development efforts have been incurred in the enterprise workforce services segment 
amortization and depreciation expense amortization and depreciation expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the majority of the increase  is due to the amortization of acquired intangible assets arising from acquisitions 
amortization and depreciation expense for the enterprise workforce services segment increased  mainly as a result of the icarian  purecarbon  and xylo  acquisitions 
in fiscal  the career transition services segment s amortization and depreciation expense increased by  during fiscal  through the acquisitions of icarian  purecarbon and xylo  we acquired capital assets of  and intangible assets of  the amortization of these acquired assets is based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
interest income and other income interest and other income was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decline was due to the reduction in short term investments 
short term investments as of may  were  compared to  at may  interest expense and other expense interest and other expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the primary reason for the increase in interest and other expense was due to interest expense incurred as a result of the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes in april and may future period interest expense related to those notes will increase significantly as the notes accrete to their current face value of million over the remaining period to maturity 
goodwill goodwill was  as of may  compared to  as of may   an increase of  or 
the increase in goodwill relates to the acquisitions completed during fiscal and includes additions during the year for shares released from escrow to the former owners of paula allen holdings 
the acquisition agreement with paula allen holdings provided that the  common shares remaining in escrow were to be released to the former owners of paula allen holdings upon workstream achieving certain consolidated revenue and profit targets for the year ending december  or at any other time in the discretion of our board of directors 
in march  our board of directors exercised its discretion and approved the release of the final  shares from escrow 
although workstream s profits on a consolidated basis did not exceed the profit targets in the acquisition agreement  our board of directors determined to release the shares from escrow based upon  among other things  the consolidated revenue targets being achieved  the unexpected effects that september  had on workstream s business and ambiguities contained in the acquisition agreement regarding the inclusion of additional operating expenses incurred from subsequent acquisitions for purposes of computing profit 
michael mullarkey  our chairman and a former shareholder of paula allen holdings  did not participate in the board discussions and did not vote on the decision to release the shares from escrow due to his conflict of interest 
prior to our acquisition of paula allen holdings  mr 
mullarkey served as an officer and director of paula allen holdings but was not a shareholder  officer  director or employee of workstream 
as an officer  director and shareholder of paula allen holdings  mr 
mullarkey participated on behalf of paula allen holdings in the negotiation and structuring of our acquisition of paula allen holdings 
management recorded during fiscal and fiscal  goodwill impairment charges totaling  related to the icarian  rezlogic and tech engine acquisitions  and  related to the paula allen holdings and omnipartners acquisitions  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources at may   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments and a working capital deficit of  throughout fiscal  we have made a significant investment in acquiring new service lines  specifically the kadiri acquisition  which has reduced working capital 
during fiscal  as a result of acquiring kadiri  peopleview and perform  we assumed current liabilities which exceeded acquired current assets by  as of the respective dates of acquisition 
at may    of short term investment balances were restricted from use because they were collateral for various borrowing or leasing arrangements 
merchant banks have required us to place reserve deposits on our merchant accounts due to the high volume of credit card usage by our clients 
these reserve deposits serve as guarantees to the merchant banks for chargebacks that may be issued to our clients that request a cancellation of our services and that previously paid for our services with a credit card 
as of may   approximately  was held as guarantees by such banks 
these deposits are reviewed quarterly and may be returned to us or increased based on the activity surrounding chargebacks and credit card usage 
we expect the level of chargebacks and credit card usage to remain consistent with levels experienced in the past 
therefore  we believe that our reserve deposits will not change significantly and will not impact our liquidity in a material way 
additional deposits of  are restricted by three banks as security for an outstanding term loan  a line of credit and letters of guarantee provided to three landlords for facility leases 
since these restricted cash balances are held as guarantees of the borrowings and leases mentioned above  as any of the borrowings or the leases change  the restricted cash balance guaranteeing them will change accordingly 
the line of credit will increase or decrease according to our working capital needs  and therefore the restricted cash guaranteeing the line of credit will change accordingly 
we expect to reduce the principal amount of the term loan on a monthly basis according to the loan agreement  and as we do so  the restricted cash balance guaranteeing the loan will decrease 
we also expect that as we make lease payments  the restricted cash guaranteeing the leases will decrease on an annual basis according to the lease agreements 
for fiscal  cash provided by operations totaled  consisting primarily of non cash expenses such as amortization  non cash interest  non cash payment to consultants  and non cash settlement of mr 
mullarkey compensation  offset mainly by the net loss for the year of  the non cash recovery of deferred income taxes of  and cash used for working capital of  our acquisitions made from july until may  have reduced our working capital 
prior to the acquisitions  the majority of these companies experienced losses generating working capital deficits 
as we have integrated them and consolidated costs  we expect to generate operating cash flow  therefore reducing our working capital deficit 
however  any future acquisitions that result in our acquiring working capital deficiencies will contribute to increasing our working capital deficit 
net cash used for investing activities during fiscal was  investing outflows consisted mainly of an increase in our restricted cash of  as a result of increased drawings under our line of credit  cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  of  purchase of short term investments of  and acquisition of capital assets of  net cash provided by financing activities was  for fiscal during fiscal  we received  in cash from individuals and institutional investors in connection with our sales of common shares and warrants to purchase common shares 
in addition  we received  in cash from institutional investors as a result of their exercise of warrants to purchase our common stock 
as a result of drawing on our credit line  we received proceeds of  financing outflows consisted primarily of the repayments of shareholder notes of  repayments of the line of credit of  costs related to the registration and issuance of the common stock of  capital lease payments of  and payment of  related to a lease settlement 
we have had operating losses since our inception  and during fiscal we continued to have operating losses as a result of non cash charges such as amortization and depreciation  and non cash interest expense related to our senior subordinated convertible notes 
however  management believes that our operations will generate operating cash flow in the future as a result of the elimination of redundant costs in the businesses we acquired in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the consolidation of ongoing operations  and improved efficiencies in the delivery of our services during the third quarter of  we satisfied the entire outstanding amounts owed under our senior subordinated convertible notes as well as the entire amount owed under the term loan provided to us by michael mullarkey  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
in january  we entered into an agreement with the holders of our convertible notes whereby they agreed to convert the remaining outstanding balance of  of the convertible notes into a total of  common shares at a conversion price of per common share see note convertible notes 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we repaid the entire outstanding principal and interest on the term loan provided to us by michael mullarkey in an amount equal to  see note related party transactions 
in january  mr 
mullarkey had agreed to provide us with a  credit facility bearing interest at per annum 
with respect to each draw against the credit facility  we were required to make monthly interest only payments during the first months from the draw date and thereafter monthly interest and principal payments over a three year period 
in march  mr 
mullarkey and workstream agreed to terminate mr 
mullarkey s commitment to provide this credit facility as a result of our improved working capital condition 
as of the date of termination  we had never drawn down on the line of credit mr 
mullarkey agreed to provide 
in may  mr 
mullarkey also agreed to defer until after june   a total of  in compensation earned as of may   as well as any additional compensation earned thereafter  with interest accruing on the balance at a rate of per annum 
the repayment date under the agreement was automatically extended each month after june  for an additional month  which resulted in the amounts continuing to remain due and outstanding for greater than days 
in february  we agreed to pay to mr 
mullarkey  of his deferred compensation  of which  was withheld for taxes 
the remaining  was not paid to mr 
mullarkey in the form of a cash payment but was applied as payment in full for mr 
mullarkey s exercise of options to purchase  common shares at an exercise price of per share 
as of february   mr 
mullarkey s total deferred compensation was  in april  mr 
mullarkey and workstream agreed to terminate his deferred compensation agreement and we paid the entire outstanding balance of  representing his deferred compensation as of march  as well as interest of  accrued through that date 
as a result  we do not owe mr 
mullarkey any additional deferred compensation and any compensation earned in the future by mr 
mullarkey will be paid in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company raised million in a private placement with william blair company and its affiliates and crestview capital 
as consideration of the private placement  the company issued  of its common shares see note 
we believe that our financial strength was improved at the end of this fiscal as a result of the funds we raised through the sale of million of our common shares in december  the conversion of our senior subordinated notes into common shares and the repayment of our term loan and deferred compensation to michael mullarkey 
we believe that our liquidity ratio  which improved from 
x as of may  to x as of may   and our debt to equity ratio  which improved from 
as of may  to 
as of may   reflect our increased financial strength 
we have also accomplished efficiencies in the area of receivables management as indicated by our improved days of sales outstanding 
our days of sales outstanding for may  was  however  this figure is distorted by the inclusion of kadiri s accounts receivable at the end of may  while not reflecting any revenue for kadiri in workstream s financial statements during fiscal due to the fact that the kadiri acquisition took place on the last business day of our fiscal year 
excluding the kadiri acquisition  our days of sales outstanding was as of may  compared to as of may  management believes the proceeds from the sale of million and million of our common shares in december and july  respectively  the closure of offices and reduction of costs made in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  along with further consolidation of cost centers and elimination of redundant costs will result in continued improvement of our working capital and positive generation of cash flows from operations which  together with current cash reserves  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least may  at may  maturities of debt outstanding  capital leases  operating leases and contractual obligations are as follows year ended may  total debt     capital leases    operating leases       total       acquisitions as part of our overall strategy  we have pursued growth through the acquisition of other companies offering services similar or complementary to ours 
through the acquisition of those companies we have expanded our service offerings enabling us to grow our revenue and to position ourselves for future profitability by consolidating operations and improving efficiencies 
on may   we acquired via merger of the outstanding shares of kadiri inc kadiri  a california based company 
as consideration for the sale  we issued to the shareholders of kadiri  of our common shares valued at approximately million 
kadiri is a provider of enterprise compensation management solutions which enable companies to plan and manage compensation  performance evaluation and monitor the granting of rewards 
kadiri had revenues of approximately million and it recorded a net loss of approximately million for the twelve months ended december  we recorded approximately million in intangible assets and million in goodwill from the acquisition 
pursuant to the acquisition agreement with kadiri  an additional  of our common shares may be released from escrow  if certain revenue and cash generation targets are met during each fiscal quarter through november  or for any indemnification claims for breaches of representation and warranties 
the release from escrow of any additional common shares will result in additional goodwill being recorded 
on march  and as amended and effective for accounting purposes on may   the company acquired certain assets of peopleview  inc peopleview  a nevada corporation 
as consideration for the sale  the company issued peopleview  of its common shares valued at  and cash in an amount equal to   of the common shares were held in escrow subject to certain representations being met 
subsequent to may   the representations were met and the escrow shares were released 
we recorded approximately million in intangible assets related to the acquisition 
peopleview designs  develops and markets software that help companies evaluate employee skills  competency and performance 
in addition  peopleview offers software that enables companies to survey their employees regarding the company s environment and assess sarbanes oxley corporate compliance 
on september   the company acquired certain assets of perform  inc perform  a delaware corporation  in connection with perform s voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as consideration for the sale  the company issued perform  of its common shares valued at  and cash in an amount equal to  in addition  the company advanced  to perform to fund its operations prior to the finalization of the asset purchase agreement with perform 
we recorded approximately million in intangible assets related to the acquisition 
perform designs  develops and markets human resource information systems and performance management information systems for mid size and global companies 
in the past we have generally acquired companies and businesses through the issuance of our common shares 
we anticipate that we will continue to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part by issuing our common shares 
however  to the extent that we use cash to fund acquisitions  the amount of funds available to satisfy our working capital needs will be reduced 
we believe that these acquisitions have been important to our evolution from a recruitment application service provider into an hcm business process aggregator 
we believe that these additions will continue to broaden our revenue base and diversify our product offerings 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors that pertain to our company 
the realization of these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  business or the market for our common shares 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully address any of these risks or address them on a continuing basis 
keep these risk factors in mind when reading forward looking statements elsewhere in this form k 
see cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements in item we may not become profitable 
since our inception  we have incurred losses which have been substantial in relation to our operations 
as of may   we had an accumulated deficit of  we reported a net loss of  for the year ended may  fiscal and a net loss of  for the year ended may  fiscal 
revenues for fiscal were  we acquired twelve companies during fiscal  fiscal and for the year ended may  fiscal  seven of which reported in the aggregate net losses of approximately million in their immediately preceding fiscal years 
our ability to reduce our losses will be adversely affected if we continue to acquire companies reporting losses  if revenue grows slower than we anticipate or if operating expenses exceed our expectations 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
failure to achieve or maintain profitability would materially adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to grow as we expand our operations 
we may encounter difficulties with acquisitions  which could harm our business 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we made several acquisitions of other companies and businesses  as part of our efforts to expand our operations and we may continue to make acquisitions of complementary companies  products and businesses 
the risks we may encounter in acquisitions include o difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  o difficulty integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  o potential exposure to product liability or intellectual property liability associated with the sale of the acquired company s products  o diversion of management time and attention and other resources  o loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management  o difficulty and expense of managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances  o our due diligence processes may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture  and legal and financial contingencies  among other things  o potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  o the incurrence of amortization expenses  o possible future goodwill impairment if the financial results and subsequent forecasted financial results are lower than those estimated at the time of the acquisition  and o possible dilution to our shareholders 
in the past  we have acquired financially distressed businesses which had lost customers prior to our acquisition of them due in part to their financial instability 
while we are generally successful in retaining the remaining customers of these businesses after we acquire them  we may be unable to recover customers already lost by these financially distressed businesses 
we have also frequently used our common shares to pay the purchase price for acquisitions 
our common shares may not remain at a price at which they can be used for acquisitions without further diluting our existing shareholders  and potential acquisition candidates may not view our stock attractively 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 
these difficulties may increase our expenses  and our ability to achieve profitability may be adversely affected 
michael mullarkey  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  may have interests that are different than other shareholders and may influence certain actions 
as of may   michael mullarkey  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  was our largest shareholder  beneficially owning approximately of our outstanding common shares 
mr 
mullarkey s interests as our largest shareholder may conflict with his fiduciary duties as an officer and director 
mr 
mullarkey s interests as our largest shareholder may influence how mr 
mullarkey votes on certain matters that require shareholder approval 
as our largest shareholder  mr 
mullarkey may influence the outcome of various actions that require shareholder approval including the election of our directors  delaying or preventing a transaction in which shareholders might receive a premium over the prevailing market price for their shares and preventing changes in control or management 
the current economic downturn and future economic downturns may adversely affect the demand for our services 
historically  the general level of economic activity has significantly affected the demand for employment and recruitment services 
we believe that we are currently experiencing the effects of the current economic downturn and as a result the demand for our employment and recruitment services has decreased 
if the general level of economic activity continues to slow  our clients may not require additional personnel and may delay or cancel plans that involve recruiting new personnel using our services and technology 
consequently  the time from initial contact with a potential client to the time of sale could increase and the demand for our services could decline  resulting in a loss of revenue harming our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  it is expected that in times of economic growth  demand for our outplacement business may decline 
we may not be able to grow our client base and revenue because of competition we face 
our future success will depend to a large extent on our ability to grow and maintain our client base and revenue 
this requires that we offer services that are superior to the services being offered by the competition that we face and that we price our services competitively 
the market for human capital management  or hcm  services is highly fragmented and competitive  with thousands of companies offering products or services that compete with one or more of the services that we offer 
we compete for a portion of employers recruiting budgets with many types of competitors  as employers typically utilize a variety of sources for recruiting  including o traditional offline recruiting firms  o traditional offline advertising  such as print media  o resume processing companies  o web based recruitment companies  o internet job posting companies  and o client server based software services 
in addition  many employers are developing or may develop their own software to satisfy their recruitment needs 
we also compete with traditional offline and web based outplacement service companies and human resource  or hr  service providers 
while we do not believe that any of our competitors offer the full suite of services that we provide  there are a number of companies that have products or services that compete with one or more of the services we provide 
for instance  companies that compete with our recruitment systems services include taleo corporation formerly recruitsoft  webhire and kenexa 
companies such as monster worldwide  execunet and netshare have products or services that compete with our applicant sourcing and exchange services 
we also compete with vendors of enterprise resource planning software  such as peoplesoft  oracle  sap and performaworks 
in the area of outplacement services  we compete with companies such as mckenzie scott and wsa corp 
finally  companies such as lifecare  next jump and sparkfly compete with our employee portal services 
we expect competition to increase and intensify in the future  with increased price competition developing for our services 
a number of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical and marketing resources and name recognition than we do  which could give them a competitive advantage 
our competitors may develop products or services that are equal or superior to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance than ours 
it is also possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
as a result  we may not be able to expand or maintain our market share and our ability to penetrate new markets may be adversely affected 
if we experience client attrition  our operating results will be adversely affected 
our recruitment systems  applicant sourcing and exchange  performance management and employee portal services clients generally enter into subscription agreements for terms of one year or less 
these clients represented and of our revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we have no assurance that these clients will maintain a long term relationship with us 
if these clients fail to renew their subscriptions with us  our business  revenues  operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
since we have only been offering our services for a limited period of time  we do not know what rate of client attrition to expect 
to the extent we experience significant client attrition  we must attract additional clients to maintain revenue 
we may not be able to strengthen and maintain awareness of our brand name 
we believe that our success will depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully develop  strengthen and maintain the recognition and reputation of our workstream brand name 
in order to strengthen and maintain our workstream brand recognition and reputation  we invest and will need to continue to invest substantial resources in our marketing efforts and maintain high standards for actual and perceived quality  usefulness  reliability  security and ease of use of our services 
if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our workstream brand name  particularly after incurring significant expenses in promoting our workstream brand name  or encounter legal obstacles which prevent our continued use of our workstream brand name  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common shares could decline 
moreover  even if we continue to provide quality service to our clients  factors outside of our control  including actions by organizations that are mistaken for us and factors generally affecting our industry  could affect our workstream brand and the perceived quality of our services 
our failure to enter into strategic relationships with third parties may harm our business 
if we are unable to enter into or maintain certain strategic relationships  our business will suffer 
these relationships generally include those with job posting boards and other on line recruitment services such as monster 
com and yahoo hotjobs pursuant to which our clients can post their job openings on such boards 
these relationships allow us to expand the services that we provide our clients without our having to spend significant capital resources developing or acquiring such services 
because many of these third parties compete with each other  the existence of a relationship with any particular third party may limit or preclude us from entering into a relationship with that third party s competitors 
in addition  some of the third parties with which we seek to enter into relationships may view us as a competitor and refuse to do business with us 
any loss of an existing relationship or failure to establish new relationships may adversely affect our ability to improve our services  offer an attractive service in the new markets that we enter  or expand the distribution of our services 
we may not be able to continue to expand our business in the united states market 
until the fiscal year ended may   we marketed our services primarily in canada 
since that time  we completed several acquisitions of businesses in the united states 
through these acquisitions we endeavored to enhance our business by penetrating the united states market 
during fiscal  and   and of our revenues  respectively  were generated in the united states 
our success and ability to grow our business will depend to a significant degree on our ability to market our services successfully in the united states 
we expect to continue to expand our operations through acquisitions of us based companies 
if we are unable to maintain or expand our us operations  we may suffer increasing losses and the loss of our investment  in whole or in part  in our acquisitions 
this could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
because we have international operations  we may face special economic and regulatory challenges that we may not be able to meet 
beginning in fiscal  we completed several acquisitions of businesses in the united states and began marketing our services outside of canada 
we expect to continue to expand our us and canadian operations through acquisitions and to spend significant financial and managerial resources to do so 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete successfully in international markets 
our international operations are subject to certain risks  including o changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and trade barriers  o changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  o potentially adverse tax consequences  o the impact of recessions in economies outside of canada  o the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  and any unexpected changes therein  o political or economic constraints on international trade or instability  and o fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we may lose business if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce new products  services and features 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products  services  or enhancements to  or new features for  existing products or services  in a timely and successful manner  we may lose sales opportunities 
the market for our services is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements  the introduction of new products and services  changes in client demands and evolving industry standards 
the adoption of new technologies or new industry standards may render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
the process of developing new services or technologies is complex and requires significant continuing efforts 
we may experience difficulties or funding shortages that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of enhancements or new products and services 
moreover  new products  services or features which we introduce may not adequately address the needs of the marketplace or achieve significant market acceptance 
our business could suffer if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including our ability to generate positive cash flow  cash required by future acquisitions  anticipated capital expenditures  the development of new services or technologies and our projected operations 
we believe that we have sufficient credit facilities  cash flow from operations and cash reserves  which  together with further cost reductions  will permit us to meet our working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements through at least may  however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds sooner than expected in order to fund expansion  develop new  and enhance existing  services or acquire complementary businesses or technologies or if our revenues are less or our expenses are greater than we expect 
our ability to obtain financing depends on a number of factors  including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations  the amount of our cash reserves  the amount and terms of our existing debt arrangements  the availability of sufficient collateral and the prospects of our business 
if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to o keep up with technological advances  o pursue acquisition opportunities  o develop product enhancements  o make capital expenditures  o respond to business opportunities  o address competitive pressures or adverse industry developments  or o withstand economic or business downturns 
future financings may be on terms adverse to your interests 
in the past we have issued and  in the future we may issue  equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds 
from may  to may  we have issued common shares and securities that are convertible into common shares amounting to a total of  common shares  including  common shares that were issued upon conversion of our senior subordinated convertible notes that were originally sold in april and may  resulting in a increase in the number of outstanding common shares assuming the conversion of the convertible securities 
if we issue additional securities  our existing shareholders may be further diluted and holders of those new securities may have dividend  liquidation  voting and other rights senior to those of the holders of our common shares 
the power of our board of directors to designate and issue shares of stock could have an adverse effect on holders of our common shares 
we are authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares  which may be issued by our board of directors for such consideration as they may consider sufficient without seeking shareholder approval 
the issuance of additional common shares in the future will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of current shareholders 
our articles of incorporation also authorize us to issue an unlimited number of class a preferred shares  the rights and preferences of which may be designated by our board of directors without shareholder approval 
the designation and issuance of class a preferred shares in the future could create additional securities that would have dividend  liquidation and voting preferences prior in right to the outstanding common shares 
these provisions could also impede a change of control 
if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company  our us shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences 
we believe that we were not a passive foreign investment company for us federal income tax purposes for fiscal years  and generally  we may be characterized as a passive foreign investment company for us federal income tax purposes if for any taxable year of our gross income is passive income  or at least of our assets are held for the production of  or produce  passive income 
this characterization could result in adverse us tax consequences to our shareholders 
these consequences may include having gains realized on the sale of our common shares treated as ordinary income  rather than capital gain income  and having potentially punitive interest charges apply to the proceeds of share sales 
us shareholders should consult with their own us tax advisors with respect to the us tax consequences of investing in our common shares 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary technologies 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our proprietary technologies and brand names 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could provide third parties with access to our technologies without payment 
if this were to occur  our proprietary technologies would lose value and our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we rely upon a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws and non disclosure and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights 
the measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  however  may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or protect us if misappropriation occurs 
policing unauthorized use of our technologies and other intellectual property is difficult  particularly because of the global nature of the internet 
we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
third parties could claim that we infringe upon their proprietary technologies 
our products  services  content and brand names may be found to infringe valid copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
in the event of a successful infringement claim against us and our failure or inability to modify our technologies or services  develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology  we may not be able to offer our services 
any claims of infringement  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management attention  require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements  modify our technologies or services or prevent us from using important technologies or services  any of which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may become subject to burdensome government regulation which could increase our costs of doing business  restrict our activities and or subject us to liability 
uncertainty and new regulations relating to the internet could increase our costs of doing business  prevent us from providing our services  slow the growth of the internet or subject us to liability  any of which could adversely affect our business  operating results and prospects 
in addition to new laws and regulations being adopted  existing laws may be applied to the internet 
there are currently few laws and regulations directly governing access to  or commerce on  the internet 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to the internet is uncertain and continues to change 
new and existing laws may cover issues which include o user privacy  o pricing controls  o consumer protection  o libel and defamation  o copyright and trademark protection  o characteristics and quality of services  o sales and other taxes  and o other claims based on the nature and control of internet materials 
recently  the canadian federal government enacted privacy legislation which requires us to appoint an individual responsible for the administration of personal information  to implement policies and practices to protect personal information  to provide access to information and to deal with complaints 
we must obtain individual consents for each collection  use or retention of personal information 
we recently implemented procedures to comply with this new privacy legislation 
the privacy legislation increases our cost of doing business due to the administrative burden of these laws  restricts our activities in light of the consent requirement and potentially subjects us to monetary liability for breach of these laws 
computer viruses or software errors may disrupt our operations  subject us to a risk of loss and or expose us to liability 
computer viruses may cause our systems to incur delays or other service interruptions 
in addition  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses or software errors in new services or products not detected until after their release could expose us to a material risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
moreover  if a computer virus affecting our system is highly publicized or if errors are detected in our software after it is released  our reputation and brand name could be materially damaged and we could lose clients 
we may experience reduced revenue  loss of clients and harm to our reputation and brand name in the event of system failures 
we may experience reduced revenue  loss of clients and harm to our reputation and brand name in the event of unexpected network interruptions caused by system failures 
our servers and software must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic 
if we are unable to add additional software and hardware to accommodate increased demand  we could experience unanticipated system disruptions and slower response times 
our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  computer viruses and similar events 
some of our systems are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities 
we have experienced delays in providing our customers access to their data in the past  and we believe these system interruptions will continue to occur from time to time in the future 
any catastrophic failure at our network operations center could prevent us from serving our clients for a number of days  or possibly weeks  and any failure of our internet service provider may adversely affect our network s performance 
most of our system interruptions are due to heavy internet traffic and minor equipment failures which generally result in our customers being unable to access their data for a few seconds or several minutes 
however  in september  our internet service provider suffered a failure which resulted in our customers being unable to access our network and their data for a period of hours 
our clients may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them or results in slower response times 
our subscription agreements generally provide that our customers will be able to access their data during certain guaranteed times 
if we fail to meet the service levels specified under our subscription agreements as a result of repeated outages  the customer can terminate its agreement with us 
our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures in our system or interruptions in our services 
breaches of our network security could be costly 
if unauthorized persons penetrate our network security  they could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services 
we may be required to spend capital and resources to protect against or to alleviate these problems 
in addition  because we host data for our clients  we may be liable to any of those clients that experience losses due to our security failures 
as a result  security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common shares may decline 
our business may be adversely affected if internet service providers fail to provide satisfactory service to our clients to enable them to use our services and access job seeker candidates on line 
failure of internet service providers or on line service providers to provide access to the internet to our clients and job seekers would prevent them from accessing our web board  which would cause our business to suffer 
many of the internet service providers  on line service providers and other web site operators on which we depend have experienced significant service slowdowns  malfunctions  outages and capacity limitations 
if users experience difficulties using our services due to the fault of third parties  our reputation and brand name could be harmed 
failure of the internet infrastructure to support current and future user activity may adversely affect our business 
we cannot assure you that the internet infrastructure will continue to effectively support the demands placed on it as the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  greater frequency of use and increased bandwidth requirements of users 
in the past  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays 
the internet is also subject to actions of terrorists or hackers who may attempt to disrupt specific web sites or internet traffic generally 
any future outages or delays could affect the willingness of employers to use our on line recruitment offerings and of job seekers to post their resumes on the internet 
if any of these events occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may not expand and upgrade our systems and hardware in a timely manner in order to accommodate growth in our business  which could adversely affect our business 
we must expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware in order to accommodate growth in our business 
we may not plan any such expansion and upgrades in a timely manner to satisfy actual growth in our business 
if we do not expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware in a timely manner to accommodate any growth in our business  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
shares eligible for future sale by our shareholders could depress the market price for our common shares 
we have filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission seeking to register the resale by certain holders of  of our common shares which are either outstanding or are issuable upon the exercise of warrants 
if the registration statement is declared effective by the securities and exchange commission an additional  common shares out of a total of  common shares outstanding assuming that all of the warrants covered by the registration statement are exercised which would not otherwise be immediately resaleable may be resold in the public market without restriction at any time 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that the resale of these additional securities or the availability of these additional securities for resale will have on the market prices of our common shares prevailing from time to time  but it could depress the market price for our common shares 
our common shares have traded at prices below and could be subject to delisting by nasdaq 
our common stock currently trades on the nasdaq small cap market and the boston stock exchange 
under the nasdaq requirements  a stock can be delisted and not allowed to trade on the nasdaq if the closing bid price of the stock over a consecutive trading day period is less than 
the boston stock exchange  however  does not maintain a similar minimum price requirement 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our common stock failed to meet the nasdaq minimum bid price requirement because the closing bid price for consecutive trading days was below 
on may   nasdaq gave us notice of this fact and gave us six months to cure this problem or our common stock would be delisted 
on july   nasdaq gave us notice that we regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule because the closing bid price of our common shares had been or more for at least consecutive trading days 
no assurance can be given that the closing bid price of our common shares will continue to satisfy the nasdaq minimum bid price requirements and thus continue to trade on the nasdaq small cap market 
although our common shares may remain listed on the boston stock exchange  if our common shares are delisted from the nasdaq small cap market  there may be a limited market for our shares  trading our stock may become more difficult and our share price could decrease even further 
if our common shares are not listed on a national securities exchange or nasdaq  potential investors may be prohibited from or be less likely to purchase our common shares  limiting the trading market for our stock even further 
we may become subject to the sec s penny stock rules  which may decrease the liquidity of our common shares and negatively impact the ability of purchasers of our common shares to sell our common shares in the secondary market 
sec regulations generally define a penny stock as an equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
we are not currently subject to the penny stock rules because our common shares qualify for two separate exceptions to the sec s penny stock rules 
the first exception from the penny stock rules for which we qualify is an exception for companies that have an equity security that is quoted on the nasdaq stock market 
since our common shares are traded on the nasdaq small cap market  we are not subject to the penny stock rules 
the second exception from the penny stock rules for which we qualify is an exception for companies that have an average revenue of at least  for the last three years 
our revenue for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal was   and  respectively  resulting in an average revenue of  if our common shares are delisted or removed from the nasdaq small cap market and if we fail to meet the average revenue exception to the penny stock rules  our common shares may become subject to the penny stock rules  which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell our common shares 
for transactions covered by these rules  the broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser of such securities and have received the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction prior to purchase 
in addition  unless an exception is available  the regulations require the delivery  prior to any transaction involving a penny stock  of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with it 
if our common shares were considered penny stock  the ability of broker dealers to sell our common shares and the ability of our shareholders to sell their securities in the secondary market would be limited 
as a result  the market liquidity for our common shares would be severely and adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that trading in our securities will not be subject to these or other regulations in the future which would negatively affect the market for our common shares 
the price of our common shares historically has been volatile  which may make it more difficult for you to resell our common shares when you want at prices you find attractive 
the market price of our common shares has been highly volatile in the past  and may continue to be volatile in the future 
for example  since june   the closing sale price of our common shares on the nasdaq small cap market has fluctuated between and per share 
the following factors may significantly affect the market price of our common shares o quarterly variations in our results of operations  o announcement of new products  product enhancements  joint ventures and other alliances by our competitors or us  o technological innovations by our competitors or us  o general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries  and o the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common shares  regardless of our operating performance

the use of performance based payment provisions in our acquisitions may result in costly legal proceedings 
we often require that a portion of the total purchase price in our acquisitions be contingent upon the acquired company s achievement of certain performance based milestones 
we believe that the use of contingent performance based payment provisions more closely matches the price we pay with the value we receive 
however  the use of these provisions has resulted and may continue to result in disputes over whether the performance based milestones have been achieved 
resolving these disputes could result in costly legal proceedings and divert management attention 
we are currently in a lawsuit with the former shareholders of figurejobs 
com  inc  a company we acquired in october under the terms of the purchase agreement pursuant to which we acquired figurejobs 
com   common shares were held in escrow to be released to the former shareholders of figurejobs 
com provided that certain revenue and profit targets were achieved 
the company determined that the revenue and profit targets were not achieved  but the representative of the former figurejobs 
com shareholders disputed that determination and filed a lawsuit against the company with regard to the escrowed shares 
although the company continues to believe that such revenue and profit targets were not met  we can not be certain that we will prevail in this dispute and that the escrowed common shares will not be released 
this suit has cost us approximately  to date 
we depend on our key employees to manage our business effectively  and if we are unable to retain our key employees  our business may be adversely affected

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees 
in  andrew hinchliff  our senior vice president north american sales  arthur halloran  our president and chief operating officer  and paul haggard  our chief financial officer  resigned from their respective positions with us

while we have hired new or appointed existing employees to fulfill the duties previously performed by messrs 
hinchliff  halloran and haggard  if any of our key employees leave before suitable replacements are found  there could be an adverse effect on our business 
there can be no assurance that suitable replacements could be hired without incurring substantial additional costs  or at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risks our exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and our bank loans 
we invest our surplus cash in an investment trust established by a canadian chartered bank  and in a certificate of deposit in a bank in the united states 
the investment trust holds various short term  low risk instruments  and can be withdrawn without penalty at any time 
the interest income from these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations which we believe will not have a material impact on our financial position 
we have established a cdn  line of credit with the bank of montreal which bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
we have drawn cdn  on this facility as of may  we can draw an additional cdn  before additional collateral would be required 
we also have a term loan with the bank in the amount of cdn  as of may  the term loan bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
additionally  we have a letter of credit issued in may as collateral on leased facilities in the amount of cdn  that will renew annually 
we pay an annual fee of on these letters of credit 
the majority of our interest rates are variable  and therefore we have exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
however  management believes that the exposure is limited as the majority of the exposure is related to the cdn  line of credit  which is fully collateralized with our restricted cash and therefore can be liquidated immediately if faced with a rising interest rate environment 
the impact on net interest income of a basis point adverse change in interest rates for the fiscal year ended may  would have been less than foreign currency risk we have monetary assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar against the us dollar will impact our reported net asset position 
a change in foreign exchange rates would result in a change in our reported net asset position of approximately
