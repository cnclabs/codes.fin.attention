item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a distributor of value added  semi finished aluminum products 
consequently  the company s sales volume has been  and will continue to be  a function of its ongoing ability to secure quality aluminum products from its suppliers 
while the company maintains long term supply relationships with several foreign mills  one supplier accounted for approximately of the company s purchases for the year ended december   and three largest suppliers accounted for of purchases 
the company s ability to succeed during the past year was driven in part by continued customer satisfaction  supplier and customer loyalty and the ability to manage the competitive economic environment through the expansion and upgrading of its service to its suppliers and customers 
this includes the ability to ship material on a just in time basis from both private and public warehouses  and the establishment of a proprietary on line service modules for customers to track their shipments 
this bolstered the company s commitment to service and customer satisfaction 
the company has also used its excellent customer relationships to leverage sales per employee 
because the company has always engaged in a strategy of developing long term relationships  it has been able to build sales volume without a similar increase in sg a 
the stable customer and supplier base has enabled the company to increase its purchases from its suppliers and to sell the majority of these quantities to its existing customer base 
while this does expose the company to concentration risks  it has provided the foundation of the company s growth and performance 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
certain accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in the financial statements 
a summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in note b to the company s financial statements 
the company has not adopted any significant new accounting policies during the period ended december  among the significant judgments made by management in the preparation of the company s financial statements are the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and accruals for inventory claims 
allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   the company had  in trade receivables 
additionally  the company had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  the company reports accounts receivable  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  to represent its estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash 
the company reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis  using historical collection trends  aging of receivables  as well as review of specific accounts  and makes adjustments in the allowance as it believes necessary 
the company maintains a credit insurance policy on the majority but not all of its customers 
in general  this policy has a co insurance 
changes in economic conditions could have an impact on the collection of existing receivable balances or future allowance considerations 
accruals for inventory claims generally  the company s exposure on claims for defective material is small as the company refers all claims on defects back to the mill supplying the material 
in the event that the company does not believe the mill will honor a claim  the company will record an allowance for inventory adjustments 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and in thousands net sales increased  or during  due to expanded shipments from the company s existing supplier base 
the company s ability to increase its supply was the main factor for its success in the ability to obtain additional product from its suppliers is the main factor for its growth in and is the primary reason for the increase in sales 
the company successfully placed increased volumes primarily within its existing customer base 
the company s top ten customers represented of sales in as compared to in prices of aluminum for most of were essentially flat 
the company s net income grew during this same period by 
the company through long term planning and use of technology did not have to increase sg a by the same percentage as its sales increased to serve its customers 
this strategy  while allowing for growth  also exposes the company to customer concentration risks 
the company benefited from the low interest rate environment 
should the interest rate environment change  the results of the company could be adversely affected 
the company s inventory increased by  for the year ended december the company s increase in inventory supported its increased sales 
in addition  as the company s customers became increasingly sensitive to timely shipments the company extended its efforts by allowing additional time to stage material in its private or public warehouses to achieve timely customer deliveries 
this effort increased inventories to ensure customer satisfaction 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and in thousands net sales increased by from to the company pursued additional volumes from its principal suppliers which resulted in the higher sales volume for the year 
gross profit increased by during the same period 
the company expanded its value added sales program  which has contributed to the overall increase in gross margin 
in addition  the company has operated more efficiently in purchasing and managing freight costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by or approximately as the result of increases in payroll  sales commissions  severance costs  professional fees and insurance costs 
interest expense declined or from  to  the decrease in interest expense is due to continued decreases in the variable rate of interest on the company s revolving line of credit 
the decline is also due  in part  to the reduction in the outstanding balance on the company s line of credit 
net income was  for as compared to  for the primary reason for the increase in net income was due to the significant reduction in interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands the company s cash balance increased by in the year ended december  net cash of  was used in operating activities  while  of net cash was provided by financing activities 
increase in inventories at year end was the most significant contributor to the increased use of cash 
the increase in inventories supports the company s increased volume of shipments 
the  of net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of borrowings under the company s line of credit 
empire currently operates under a revolving line of credit  including a commitment to issue letters of credit  with three commercial banks 
the maximum availability of this facility is million 
borrowings under these lines of credit are collateralized by security interests in substantially all of empire s assets 
under these credit agreements  empire is required to maintain working capital and net worth ratios 
these facilities expire on june  as of december   the amount outstanding under the company s revolving lines of credit was million including letters of credit of approximately million 
management believes that cash from operations  together with funds available under its credit facility  will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements relating to the company s existing operations 
empire may require additional debt or equity financing in connection with the future expansion of its operations 
commitments and contingencies in thousands less than year years years after years bank debt  operating leases letters of credit  empire has contingent liabilities in the form of letters of credit to some of its suppliers 
certain factors affecting future operating results the company is highly dependent on a few suppliers 
the company purchased approximately of its products from one supplier in and approximately from its three largest suppliers 
as a result  the termination or limitation by one or more of the company s largest suppliers of their relationship with the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  the company s loss of any one of its other suppliers or material default by any such supplier in its obligations to the company due to bankruptcy  financial difficulties  expropriation  social unrest  destruction  sabotage  strikes  acquisition by a person or entity unwilling to provide products to the company  or for any other reason  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company is highly dependent on a few significant customers 
the company s sales are highly concentrated to a few customers 
in  of the company s revenues were derived from sales to ten customers 
one major customer accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated net sales for the year ended december  as a result  any material reduction in sales to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
an act of war or terrorism could disrupt the company s supply of products 
the company purchases its aluminum products exclusively from foreign suppliers 
an act of war or terrorism could disrupt international shipping schedules  cause additional delays in importing the company s products into the united states or increase the costs required to do so 
the company s supply sources are subject to substantial risks 
the company generally purchases aluminum products from foreign suppliers 
thus  its operations could be materially and adversely affected by changes in economic  political and social conditions in the countries where the company currently purchases or may in the future purchase such products 
among other things  changes in laws  regulations  or the interpretation thereof  or restrictions on currency conversions and exports  could negatively affect the company s business 
although the trend in the markets in which the company operates for its sourcing has been towards open markets and trade policies and the fostering of private economic activity  no assurance can be given that the governments will continue to pursue these policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered  especially in the event of a change in the leadership  or as a result of social or political upheaval or unforeseen circumstances affecting economic  political or social life 
consolidation of suppliers may materially affect the company s operations 
during the last several years  consolidations have been taking place among aluminum suppliers 
although the company has in the past successfully replaced any suppliers lost as a result of industry consolidations  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to replace the volume of production or the type of products supplied by any of its current vendors  if they were acquired or their operations terminated or were interrupted 
changing aluminum prices could impact the company s profit margins 
the company relies on long term relationships with its suppliers  but generally has no long term  fixed price purchase contracts  it purchases at prevailing market prices at the time orders are placed  typically with discounts for quantity purchases 
the aluminum industry is highly cyclical  and the prices that the company pays for aluminum and the prices it charges will be influenced by a variety of factors outside of its control  including general economic conditions both domestic and international  competition  production levels  import duties and other trade restrictions  and currency fluctuations 
while the company hedges metal pricing and foreign currency as it deems appropriate for a portion of its purchase and sales contracts  there exists the risk of a counterparty default in fulfilling the hedge contract 
should there be a counterparty default  the company could be exposed to losses on the original hedged contract 
if suppliers fail to provide products of sufficient quality customer relationships and prices could be negatively affected 
the company s relationships with its customers depend  in part  on its ability to deliver products of the quality specified by those customers 
the company obtains certifications from its suppliers as to the quality of the products being supplied 
however  if the product is not of the quality certified or if a supplier fails to deliver products ordered by the company  the company may be forced to buy product of the specified quality from another source to fulfill the customer s order 
while the company would then be left with a claim against the supplier for any loss sustained by the company  the company may not be able to successfully prosecute these claims  particularly in foreign jurisdictions 
the company is exposed to credit risk from its customers 
the company does not require collateral for customer receivables 
the company has significant balances owing from customers that operate in cyclical industries and under leveraged conditions  which may impair the collectability of these receivables 
the company carries credit insurance with a co pay provision and specific limits on each customer s receivables 
the company sometimes elects to exceed these specific credit limits 
the company s failure to collect a significant portion of the amount due on its receivables directly from customers or through insurance claims or other material default by customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in selected instances the co pay may be increased 
rising interest rates may increase our borrowing costs our borrowings are primarily short term libor based loans 
if interest rates rise  our cost of borrowing will increase and lower our profitability 
higher interest rates may also adversely affect some of the markets for our products  such as transportation  housing and commercial construction 
increased tariffs could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
during  in excess of of sales of the company represented sales of aluminum products from countries that were considered developing countries whose exports were eligible for preferential tariff treatment upon import into the united states under the generalized system of preferences gsp 
there can be no assurance that any of our suppliers will continue to be eligible for such preferential tariff treatment or that the generalized system of preference will be renewed after it expires on december  if the preferential tariff treatment of any of our suppliers that are currently eligible for such treatment becomes unavailable  then imports from such supplier may be subjected to a tariff  instead of the duty free treatment those imports now enjoy 
to the extent these increased costs could not be passed on to its customers  the company s profit margins could be negatively affected 
this could result in higher costs to us and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
antidumping and other duties could be imposed on the company  its suppliers and their products 
the imposition of an antidumping or other increased duty on any products imported by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
for example  under united states law  an antidumping duty may be imposed on any imports if two conditions are met 
first  the department of commerce must decide that the imports are being sold in the united states at less than fair value 
second  the international trade commission the itc must determine that the united states industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of the imports 
the itc s determination of injury involves a two prong inquiry first  whether the industry is materially injured  and second  whether the dumping  not other factors  caused the injury 
the itc is required to analyze the volume of imports  the effect of imports on united states prices for like merchandise  and the effects the imports have on united states producers of like products  taking into account many factors  including lost sales  market share  profits  productivity  return on investment  and utilization of production capacity 
on october   alcoa  inc filed a petition with the department of commerce doc and the international trade commission itc for the imposition of anti dumping duties on imports of certain aluminum rolled plate from hulett aluminium ltd  the company s major supplier of aluminum products 
the petition relates to one specific product produced by hulett series aluminum rolled plate 
hulett produces numerous other products that the company presently imports 
hulett announced that it would contest the allegations  which it believes are flawed 
it is expected that the investigation could take up to a year to complete 
as part of the investigation  empire resources presented data required by the itc  a hearing was held and the itc voted that the investigation should continue 
the second phase of the investigation is conducted by the doc which must be completed by hulett aluminum 
the findings from the doc are expected in may or june of should the doc find that there was dumping in the united states market  the itc would begin an injury phase of the investigation to determine what if any tariffs should be imposed 
the company has been assured by hulett that it will continue to ship the product  pending the results of the investigation 
in the event that hulett  in the future  ceases supply of the product and if the company is unable to secure an alternative source of supply for the product at comparable volumes and prices  the company s future results of operations could be adversely affected 
if the company fails to deliver products on a timely basis  it may suffer losses 
interruption of shipping schedules upon which the company relies for foreign purchases could result in untimely deliveries to the company s customers or cause the company to purchase the products in the united states at a higher cost in order to meet delivery schedules 
consequently  the company s profit margins could be reduced or it could suffer losses 
the company guarantees its customers that it will deliver products within the period specified in their purchase orders 
any interruption of the means of transportation used by the company to transport products could cause delays in delivery of products  could force the company to buy the products from domestic suppliers at a higher cost in order to fulfill its commitments  and also could result in the loss of customers 
the company competes with companies with captive sources of supply 
many of the company s competitors are significantly larger than the company and many have captive sources of supply and significantly greater access to capital and other resources 
thus  if the company s sources of supply are interrupted  its competitors could be in a position to capture the company s customers 
the company is dependent on its executive officers 
the company is highly dependent on its executive officers  the loss of any of one of which could have a significant adverse impact on the company s business 
the company is exposed to increased energy costs 
to the extent that the company utilizes both over the road and ocean transportation  the imposition of any additional fuel or bunker surcharges may adversely affect the company s results 
should the company be unable to pass along any such changes to its customers  the company s results would be adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses financial instruments designated as fair value hedges to manage its exposure to commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk inherent in its trading activities 
it is the company s policy to hedge such risks  to the extent practicable 
the company enters into high grade aluminum futures contracts to limit its gross margin exposure by hedging the metals content element of firmly committed purchase and sales commitments 
in cases where the company enters into fixed price contracts with its supplier and variable priced sales with its customers the company will utilize the futures market to match the terms of the purchase and sale 
the company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its exposure related to commitments to purchase or sell non ferrous metals denominated in international currencies 
in situations where the company enters into purchase or sales denominated in foreign currency the foreign exchange market will be utilized to hedge foreign exchange risk exposure 
the company records mark to market adjustments on these futures and forward positions  and on the underlying firm purchase and sales commitments which they hedge  and reflects the net gains and losses currently in earnings 
at december   net unrealized gains on the company s foreign exchange forward contracts amounted to approximately  as compared to  at december  and net unrealized losses on aluminum futures contracts amounted to approximately  as compared to  in these unrealized amounts were offset by like amounts on the underlying commitments which were hedged  and are reflected in the accompanying and balance sheet in other current assets  inventory  and accrued expenses 
unrealized amounts are reflected on the balance sheet in other current assets  inventory  and accrued expenses
