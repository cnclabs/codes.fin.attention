item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in the section entitled risk factors in this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in its entirety  since it contains detailed information that is important to understanding health net  inc and its subsidiaries results and financial condition 
the executive summary below is qualified in its entirety by the full management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the information contained in the executive summary is as of march  executive summary we are an integrated managed care organization that delivers managed health care services through health plans and government sponsored managed care plans 
our health plans and government contracts subsidiaries provide health benefits through our hmos  ppos and pos plans to approximately million individuals in states 
we also offer managed health care products related to behavioral health and prescription drugs 
in addition  we own health and life insurance companies licensed to sell epo  ppo  pos and indemnity products  as well as auxiliary non health products in states and the district of columbia 
we operate health plans in six states arizona  california  connecticut  new jersey  new york and oregon and offer our products to commercial  medicare and medicaid members 
we have sold or otherwise disposed of a number of health plans over the past several years to focus our sales and marketing efforts on these six plans in populous and contiguous markets  most notably southern california and the new york metropolitan area  which we believe offer sustained growth opportunities 
operating highlights and outlook for over the past several years  our overall operating performance has improved 
our health plan medical care ratio mcr was for  an basis point decline from our goal is to achieve a modest improvement of approximately to basis points in our mcr each year 
we exceeded this range in as health care costs rose more slowly than expected 
our government contracts cost ratio  which includes both health care and administrative costs  has remained relatively stable in the past three years and we expect it to continue to remain stable over the next several years 
at the end of  our debt to capital ratio was  well below our stated target of 
our administrative ratio 
table of contents g a expenses plus depreciation was in we have targeted administrative costs for savings in the future 
as more fully described below  as a result of the phased implementation of our health net one systems consolidation project  we expect improvements in g a expenses in the second half of we expect to reduce our administrative ratio by approximately basis points in the next two to three years 
in  our net margin was  and was impacted by a loss in discontinued operations 
over the past several years  operating cash flow has been very strong 
this cash flow has  in part  been used to repurchase shares of our common stock 
since the commencement of our stock repurchase program in may  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of 
our success in and beyond will depend  in part  on our ability to price our health plan products at a level equal to or greater than the growth in health care costs  as well as our ability to contain growth in our health care costs  especially hospital costs  by employing a range of medical management  pharmaceutical management and provider contracting strategies 
in addition  we must successfully implement our new tricare contract for the north region  complete our health net one systems consolidation project  continue to foster and improve our provider relations and continue growing and solidifying our presence in all of the markets in which we do business 
it is also important that we introduce new products and variations on existing products and begin to competitively differentiate our products so that we can compete on factors other than price alone 
in  we will begin the rollout of a new branding initiative called the rosetta stone  which we believe could provide us with a differentiated position in the health care marketplace 
for additional information regarding our new branding initiative  see item business additional information concerning our business new branding initiative 
our health plan operations in the northeast  and  in particular  our new jersey health plan  face unique challenges in related to hospital costs 
in and  we recontracted our hospital network in new jersey  moving  in large part  to contracts with greater emphasis on reimbursement methodologies related to billed charges  stop loss provisions on the in patient side and percentage of billed charges discounts on the out patient side 
we did not adequately incorporate the impact of these changes into our pricing models 
as a result  and due to issues relating to the impact of leap year  on february   we lowered our earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year of in order to address the issues we have experienced in the northeast and  in particular  new jersey  we have reorganized our senior management team in the northeast 
our new senior management team has commenced a focused review of hospital contracting  underwriting and premium pricing in the northeast  as well as opportunities for administrative cost savings through reorganization and other cost savings initiatives 
we expect to report the results of our assessment of the northeast s performance on our earnings conference call for the first quarter of health plan operations 
we are targeting future enrollment growth of to per year and ongoing gross and operating margin expansion in our health plan operations through a stable to slightly declining mcr and declining g a expenditures 
over the past three years  our overall health plan enrollment has declined as we intentionally exited certain large group accounts and focused our sales and marketing efforts on small group accounts in an effort to improve profitability 
in  small group and individual enrollment increased as compared to our outlook for is continued growth in our commercial enrollment 
we expect to continue pursing small group business generally defined as an employer group with to employees in the future  as we believe this is where most job growth will occur over the next several years in the markets we serve 
however  we expect the rate of growth in small group enrollment to slow in because the baseline for measurement purposes increased due to the rapid growth we have experienced in small group enrollment in recent years 
we expect large group enrollment in the northeast  in particular  connecticut  to continue to decline in due to ongoing profitability issues in certain large employer group accounts 
we expect large group enrollment in california to rebound in  as we gained key accounts in january representing approximately  members 
we expect to expand our medicare marketing efforts in in response to the new medicare reform legislation that was passed in december the improved funding provided through this new legislation provides a basis for us to reverse medicare enrollment declines from recent years which were caused by inadequate funding from the centers for medicare and medicaid services 
we participate in state medicaid programs in three states  california  connecticut and new jersey 
california medicaid membership  where the program is known as medi cal  comprises of our medicaid membership 
despite ongoing concerns about the states ability to adequately fund these medicaid programs  we believe that the significant savings generated by medicaid managed care will provide ongoing future growth opportunities  especially in california  as states may move more medicaid enrollees into managed care plans 
we will add two counties for california medi cal in we believe the addition of these new counties will help counteract enrollment declines resulting from the state of california tightening eligibility requirements 

table of contents our product line in our health plan operations has begun to change over the past few years 
we have been selling ppo products at a faster growth rate than hmos  which historically has been our largest enrollment 
at the end of  approximately of our commercial enrollment was in hmo products  down from as of december  in response to growing demand from employers for more flexible product lines  we are developing and plan to introduce consumer directed health plan products in the next several years 
in  we test marketed one such product in our oregon health plan 
we expect commercial premium yields to increase at a slower rate in compared to the yield achieved in this is consistent with expected declines in overall health care cost trends and in line with our philosophy of maintaining premium prices slightly higher than our health care cost trends 
we believe this slowing of rate increases is consistent with industry trends for in medicare  we expect that premium revenues will rise at a faster pace due to increased funding from the medicare reform legislation 
we expect that medicaid premiums will again rise at a slower rate than health care costs and expect that they will decline slightly in california  due to the state s budget pressures 
this expectation is consistent with our ongoing overall strategic approach to participate selectively in the medicaid market 
since much of our medi cal membership is serviced by medical groups to whom we make capitation payments  our revenues and profit margin are not significantly impacted by these declining premiums 
with respect to our g a expenses  we expect that growth in overall spending will continue in the first half of with the continued funding of the health net one systems consolidation project described below 
as a result  we expect to see a decline in the administrative ratio in the second half of as we eliminate expenses associated with the project  eliminate the need to maintain two separate technology platforms and begin to realize savings 
we believe that managing health care costs is an essential function for a managed care company 
in  hospital costs rose at a faster pace than other costs 
we have implemented a number of projects to curtail the rate of growth in hospital costs and expect the rate of growth to slow in from the recorded in these projects include new contracting strategies  including an increase in the use of reimbursement methodologies that are not based on hospital billed charges  and other techniques 
among the medical management techniques we utilize to contain the growth of health care costs are pre authorization or certification for outpatient and inpatient hospitalizations and a concurrent review of active inpatient hospital stays and discharge planning 
we also contract with third parties to manage certain conditions such as neonatal intensive care unit admissions and stays  as well as chronic conditions such as asthma  diabetes and congestive heart failure 
these techniques are widely used in the managed care industry and are accepted practice in the medical profession 
in  our physician cost increases were  consistent with expectations 
pharmaceutical costs for all lines declined slightly in as compared with the industry trend of an approximate increase and prior year trends in the low double and high single digit percentages 
increased use of multi tier benefits  increased use of generic drugs and the conversion of two popular medications to over the counter status were key factors in the slowing of the pharmaceutical costs growth rate 
we have implemented a number of techniques to contain the growth of pharmaceutical costs including  without limitation  pre authorization or certification for the use of certain high cost pharmaceuticals 
we believe the rate of growth in pharmaceutical costs will grow in because of increases in the cost of certain specialty pharmaceuticals and more challenging comparisons to our performance in tricare 
our government contracts reportable segment includes government sponsored managed care plans through the tricare programs and other government contracts 
in august  we were awarded a new five year contract for the tricare north region that supports nearly million military health system eligible participants 
the new north region contract covers connecticut  delaware  illinois  indiana  kentucky  maine  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  rhode island  vermont  virginia  west virginia  wisconsin and the district of columbia 
in addition  the contract covers a small portion of tennessee  missouri and iowa 
health care delivery is expected to begin on the new contract on july  for the area that was previously regions and and september  for the area that was previously region we incur administrative and health care expenses in connection with our administration of the tricare program in the regions we manage on behalf of the department of defense 
health care expenses are directly related to the use of civilian providers by tricare eligible beneficiaries and have risen in recent quarters as a direct result of increased military activity 
increased military activity results in increased enrollment and the deployment of military medical personnel overseas which reduces beneficiaries access to military treatment facilities 
we expect that in we will continue to experience elevated levels of costs due to reservist call ups and higher utilization of civilian providers 

table of contents however  as part of our contract with the department of defense  we are reimbursed for costs related to this heightened military activity 
as noted above  we expect our government contracts cost ratio to remain relatively stable in compared with  even with the transition to our new tricare contract for the north region 
a description of the differences in the economic structure between our existing tricare contracts and the new contract for the north region is contained in item business segment information government contracts segment tricare 
we believe that the changes in the economic structure of the new contract  when compared to our expiring contracts  should reduce our risk related to the ability to accurately project our profitability over the term of the new contract 
health net one systems consolidation project 
we are in the process of converting a number of information systems in our health plan business to a single information system 
this system is currently in use in our northeast and arizona health plans and project completion is scheduled for the third quarter of this project  known as health net one  also includes consolidation initiatives for other functional areas  such as claims handling  customer service and product development 
we believe health net one will produce administrative cost savings and improved service capability over the next several years 
we believe that having our health plans operate off a single information technology platform will permit us to develop and deploy new products more rapidly  thus producing a competitive advantage in our markets 
we completed the conversion of our arizona health plan to the selected system in although we did encounter some operational issues  such as build up in the claims backlog  these issues were eventually resolved 
we have incorporated the knowledge gained from these issues into the overall health net one project plan 
for additional information regarding our health net one systems consolidation project  see item business additional information concerning our business health net one systems consolidation project 
provider network 
we maintain a large network of providers to service our members in the six states in which we have health plans 
these networks include a broad range of hospitals  including academic medical centers and community hospitals 
we maintain contracts with large integrated physician groups  independent practice associations and individual primary care specialty physicians 
overall  we believe that our provider relations are generally good 
in recent years  we have implemented a number of techniques specifically aimed at the review of very high cost hospital claims  a problem that has plagued the entire managed care industry and hospitals 
some of these techniques  including reviews of individual claims  create differences of interpretation between us and hospitals 
we have been able to resolve these differences through negotiation or  in some cases  through arbitration 
given the high rate of growth in hospital costs  we believe we must continue to be vigilant in our review of these costs 
our efforts to maintain good relations with our providers  particularly hospitals  will have a significant impact on our ability to achieve our financial goals in and beyond 
see risk factors if we are unable to maintain good relations with the physicians  hospitals and other providers that we contract with  our profitability could be adversely affected

health plan services premiums compared to health plan services premiums increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in total health plan services premiums on a pmpm basis increased to or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in these changes are primarily due to the following increase in commercial premiums of million or due to an increase in premiums on a pmpm basis  partially offset by a decrease of in member months 
the premium increases on a pmpm basis occurred in large and small groups across all states  with california and new jersey having the largest increases ranging from to 
the decrease in member months is primarily due to the loss of the calpers account in california and the loss of members in arizona  connecticut and pennsylvania  increase in medicaid premiums by million or driven by an increase of in member months combined with an increase of in premiums on a pmpm basis 
the premium increases were seen in connecticut and new jersey due to rate increases and increased reimbursement rates for maternity charges in new jersey

these increases are primarily from membership increases in the healthy families program in california 
government contracts revenues compared to government contracts revenues increased by million or for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to the following increase in risk sharing revenue of million from increased health care cost estimates resulting from the call up of reservists in support of the nation s heightened military activity and an increased number of enrollees seeking care in the private sector as many military health care professionals were deployed abroad  increase in revenues of million due to higher base contract pricing on new option periods  increase in revenues of million from change order cost activities  increase in revenues of million due to favorable bid price adjustments  and increase in revenues of million from transition services related to the new tricare contract for the north region 
transition payments for services connected to the north region contract are on a fixed price basis 
revenues for such services are based on contract terms and approximate incurred expenses to date

the decrease in member months is the result of our planned exit from certain counties in california  arizona and connecticut 
the increases in health care costs on a pmpm basis are primarily in california and connecticut  which experienced higher physician capitation rates and increased inpatient and outpatient utilization 
these trends are also consistent with revenue increases and limited medicare fee schedule increases 
health plan services mcr decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in the decrease is primarily due to a continued focus on pricing discipline combined with pricing increases above the health care cost trend for our commercial and medicare risk products

liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash flow from operating activities  existing working capital  lines of credit  and funds from any potential divestitures of business are adequate to allow us to fund existing obligations  introduce new products and services  and continue to develop health care related businesses

we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes  either through issuance of debt or equity  the sale of investment securities or otherwise  as appropriate

additionally  the timely collection of such receivables is also impacted by government audit and negotiation and could extend for periods beyond a year

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
principal areas requiring the use of estimates include revenue recognition  health care costs  reserves for contingent liabilities  amounts receivable or payable under government contracts  goodwill and recoverability of long lived assets and investments 
accordingly  we consider accounting policies on these areas to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a significant change in any one of these amounts may have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that we use in preparing our financial statements is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition health plan services premiums include hmo  pos and ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage  for which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts to provide care to enrolled medicare recipients 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the related enrollees are entitled to health care services 
premiums collected in advance of the month in which enrollees are entitled to health care services are recorded as unearned premiums 
government contracts revenues are recognized in the month in which the eligible beneficiaries are entitled to health care services or in the month in which the administrative services are performed or the period that coverage for services is provided 
government contracts also contain cost and performance incentive provisions which adjust the contract price based on actual performance 
revenue under government contracts is subject to price adjustments attributable to inflation and other factors 
the effects of these adjustments are recognized on a monthly basis  although the final determination of these amounts could extend significantly beyond the period during which the services were provided 

table of contents from time to time  we make adjustments to our revenues based on retroactivity 
these retroactivity adjustments reflect changes in the number of enrollees subsequent to when the revenue is billed 
we estimate the amount of future retroactivity each period and accordingly adjust the billed revenue 
the estimated adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of contract renewal activity during the period and other information 
we refine our estimates and methodologies as information on actual retroactivity becomes available 
on a monthly basis  we estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables to reflect allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on the creditworthiness of our customers  our historical collection rates and the age of our unpaid balances 
during this process  we also assess the recoverability of the receivables  and an allowance is recorded based upon their net realizable value 
those receivables that are deemed to be uncollectible  such as receivables from bankrupt employer groups  are fully written off against their corresponding asset account  with a debit to the allowance to the extent such an allowance was previously recorded 
health plan services reserves for claims and other settlements and health care and other costs payable under government contracts include reserves for claims incurred but not reported claims ibnr and received but unprocessed claims  and other liabilities including capitation payable  shared risk settlements  provider disputes  provider incentives and other reserves for our two reporting segments  health plan services and government contracts 
as of december   health plan services reserves for claims comprised approximately of reserves for claims and other settlements  and government contracts reserves for claims comprised approximately of health care and other costs payable under government contracts 
see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of changes in the reserve for claims 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for claims primarily by using standard actuarial developmental methodologies 
this method is also known as the chain ladder or completion factor method 
the developmental method estimates reserves for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid while taking into consideration  among other things  expected medical cost inflation  seasonality patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
a key component of the developmental method is the completion factor which is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the claims for services rendered for a given period 
while the completion factors are reliable and robust for older service periods  they are more volatile and less reliable for more recent periods since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been rendered 
accordingly  for the most recent months  the incurred claims are estimated from a trend analysis based on per member per month claims trends developed from the experience in preceding months 
this method is applied consistently year over year while assumptions may be adjusted to reflect changes in medical cost inflation  seasonality patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
an extensive degree of actuarial judgment is used in this estimation process  considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  and the estimates are highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and payment patterns and medical cost trends 
as such  the completion factors and the claims per member per month trend factor are the most significant factors used in estimating our reserves for claims 
since a large portion of the reserves for claims is attributed in the most recent months  the estimated reserves for claims is highly sensitive to these factors 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by these factors completion factor a increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims government contracts increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million million million million million medical cost trend b increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims government contracts increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million million million million million 
table of contents a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to the estimate of total claims for a given period 
therefore  an increase in completion factor percent results in a decrease in the remaining estimated reserves for claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trend used to estimate the per member per month cost for the most recent three months 
other relevant factors include exceptional situations that might require judgmental adjustments in setting the reserves for claims  such as system conversions  processing interruptions  environmental changes or other factors 
none of these factors had a material impact on the development of our claims payable estimates during any of the periods presented in this annual report on form k 
all of these factors are used in estimating reserves for claims and are important to our reserve methodology in trending the claims per member per month for purposes of estimating the reserves for the most recent months 
in developing its best estimate of reserves for claims  we consistently apply the principles and methodology listed above from year to year  while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors 
because reserves for claims includes various actuarially developed estimates  our actual health care services expense may be more or less than our previously developed estimates 
claim processing expenses are also accrued based on an estimate of expenses necessary to process such claims 
such reserves are continually monitored and reviewed  with any adjustments reflected in current operations 
our hmo in california generally contracts with various medical groups to provide professional care to certain of its members on a capitated  or fixed per member per month fee basis 
capitation contracts generally include a provision for stop loss and non capitated services for which we are liable 
professional capitated contracts also generally contain provisions for shared risk 
we have risk sharing arrangements with certain of our providers related to approximately  members primarily in the california commercial market 
shared risk arrangements provide for our providers and us to share in the variance between actual costs and predetermined goals 
our health plans in connecticut  new jersey and new york market to small employer groups through a marketing agreement with the guardian life insurance company of america 
we have approximately  members under this agreement 
in general  we share equally with the guardian in the profits of the marketing agreement  subject to certain terms of the marketing agreement related to expenses 
our hmos in other states also contract with hospitals  physicians and other providers of health care  pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements  hospital per diems  and case rates under which providers bill the hmos for each individual service provided to enrollees 
additionally  we contract with certain hospitals to provide hospital care to enrolled members on a capitation basis 
we assess the profitability of contracts for providing health care services when operating results or forecasts indicate probable future losses 
significant factors that can lead to a change in our profitability estimates include margin assumptions  risk share terms and non performance of a provider under a capitated agreement resulting in membership reverting to fee for service arrangements with other providers 
contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with the method of determining premium rates 
losses are determined by comparing anticipated premiums to the total of health care related costs less reinsurance recoveries  if any  and the cost of maintaining the contracts 
losses  if any  are recognized in the period the losses are determined and are classified as health plan services 
we had no premium deficiency reserves as of december  reserves for contingent liabilities in the course of our operations  we are involved on a routine basis in various disputes with members  health care providers  and other entities  as well as audits by government agencies that relate to our services and or business practices 
we and several of our competitors were named as defendants in a number of significant class action lawsuits alleging violations of various federal statutes  including the employee retirement income security act of and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act 
we recognize an estimated loss from such loss contingencies when we believe it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our loss estimates are based in part on an analysis of potential results  the stage of the proceedings  our relevant insurance coverage  consultation with outside counsel and any other relevant information available 
while the final outcome of these proceedings cannot be determined at this time  
table of contents based on information presently available we believe that the final outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  our belief regarding the likely outcome of such proceedings could change in the future and an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in addition  the ultimate outcome of these loss contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty and it is difficult to measure the actual loss  if any  that might be incurred 
government contracts amounts receivable under government contracts are composed primarily of billed and estimated amounts receivable under cost and performance incentive provisions  price adjustments  and change orders for services not originally specified in the contracts 
these receivables develop as a result of tricare health care costs rising faster than the forecasted health care cost used in the original contract bids  data revisions on formal contract adjustments and routine contract changes for benefit adjustments 
change orders for services not originally specified in government contracts arise because the government often directs us to implement changes to our contracts before the scope and or value of the related services is defined or negotiated 
when such a change is implemented  we may start to incur the related costs immediately  even before we have proposed a price to the government 
in these situations  our policy is to collect and defer the costs incurred  we make no attempt to estimate and record revenue 
once we have submitted a cost proposal to the government  we record the costs and the appropriate value for revenue  using our best estimate of what will ultimately be negotiated 
such estimates are determined based on information available as well as historical performance and collection of which could extend for periods beyond a year 
differences  which may be material  between the revenue amounts estimated and final amounts collected are recorded in the period when determined 
as discussed in the government contracts membership section  we are in process of determining the proper accounting for various other provisions of the new tricare north region contract 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually based on the estimated fair value of the reporting units which comprise our health plan services and government contracts reportable segments 
we test for impairment on a more frequent basis in cases where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of goodwill 
our measurement of fair value is based on utilization of both the income and market approaches to fair value determination 
as a part of assessing impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform fair value measurements and utilize an independent third party professional services firm to assist with this assessment 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flow methodology is based upon converting expected cash flows to present value 
annual cash flows are estimated for each year of a defined multi year period until the growth pattern becomes stable 
the expected interim cash flows expected after the growth pattern becomes stable are calculated using an appropriate capitalization technique and then discounted 
the market approach uses a market valuation methodology which includes the selection of companies engaged in a line or lines of business similar to ours to be valued and an analysis of our comparative operating results and future prospects in relation to those of the guideline companies selected 
the market price multiples are selected and applied to us based on our relative performance  future prospects and risk profiles in comparison to those of the guideline companies 
methodologies for selecting guideline companies include the exchange methodology and the acquisition methodology 
the exchange methodology is based upon transactions of minority interests in publicly traded companies engaged in a line or lines of business similar to ours 
the public companies selected are defined as guideline companies 
the acquisition methodology involved analyzing the transaction involving similar companies that have been bought and sold in the public marketplace 
there are numerous assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the estimated fair value of our reporting units  including certain assumptions and estimates related to future earnings based on current and future initiatives 
if these initiatives do not accomplish their targeted objectives  the assumptions and estimates underlying the goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected and have a material effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents recoverability of long lived assets and investments we periodically assess the recoverability of our long lived assets including property and equipment and other long term assets and investments where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value as follows long lived assets held and used we test long lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
if we identify an indicator of impairment  we assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value 
long lived assets held for sale long lived assets are classified as held for sale when certain criteria are met  which include management commitment to a plan to sell the assets  the availability of the assets for immediate sale in their present condition  whether an active program to locate buyers and other actions to sell the assets has been initiated  whether the sale of the assets is probable and their transfer is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year  whether the assets are being marketed at reasonable prices in relation to their fair value and how unlikely it is that significant changes will be made to the plan to sell the assets 
we measure long lived assets to be disposed of by sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value is determined using quoted market prices or the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale we classify an asset or asset group that will be disposed of other than by sale as held and used until the disposal transaction occurs 
the asset or asset group continues to be depreciated based on revisions to its estimated useful life until the date of disposal or abandonment 
recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the remaining period of use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset 
statutory capital requirements certain of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital and surplus requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
as of december   we estimated that our regulated subsidiaries had approximately million in statutory net worth  or approximately million in excess of current regulatory requirements 
we generally manage our aggregate regulated subsidiary capital against of risk based capital rbc company action levels  although rbc standards are not yet applicable to all of our regulated subsidiaries 
certain subsidiaries must maintain ratios of current assets to current liabilities pursuant to certain government contracts 
management believes that as of december   all of our health plans and insurance subsidiaries met their respective regulatory requirements 
as necessary  we make contributions to and issue standby letters of credit on behalf of our subsidiaries to meet risk based capital or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations 
our parent company contributed million to certain of its subsidiaries to meet capital requirements during the year ended december  of the million  we contributed million to our new jersey health plan and million to our insurance company in 
table of contents connecticut 
except for the million in capital contributions  our parent company did not make any capital contributions to its subsidiaries to meet risk based capital or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations during the year ended december  or thereafter through the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
legislation has been or may be enacted in certain states in which our subsidiaries operate imposing substantially increased minimum capital and or statutory deposit requirements for hmos in such states 
such statutory deposits may only be drawn upon under limited circumstances relating to the protection of policyholders 
as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements  certain subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies 
such restrictions  unless amended or waived  or unless regulatory approval is granted  limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations 
the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus  statutory income and unassigned surplus 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and market risk primarily due to our investing and borrowing activities 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and in equity prices 
interest rate risk is a consequence of maintaining variable interest rate earning investments and fixed rate liabilities or fixed income investments and variable rate liabilities 
we are exposed to interest rate risks arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates  prepayment speeds and or the shape and slope of the yield curve 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential that changes in an issuer s credit rating or credit perception may affect the value of financial instruments 
we have several bond portfolios to fund reserves 
we attempt to manage the interest rate risks related to our investment portfolios by actively managing the asset liability duration of its investment portfolios 
the overall goal for the investment portfolios is to provide a source of liquidity and support the ongoing operations of our business units 
our philosophy is to actively manage assets to maximize total return over a multiple year time horizon  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
each business unit has additional requirements with respect to liquidity  current income and contribution to surplus 
we manage these risks by setting risk tolerances  targeting asset class allocations  diversifying among assets and asset characteristics  and using performance measurement and reporting 
we use a value at risk var model  which follows a variance covariance methodology  to assess the market risk for our investment portfolio 
var is a method of assessing investment risk that uses standard statistical techniques to measure the worst expected loss in the portfolio over an assumed portfolio disposition period under normal market conditions 
the determination is made at a given statistical confidence level 
we assumed a portfolio disposition period of days with a confidence level of for the computation of var for the computation further assumes that the distribution of returns is normal 
based on such methodology and assumptions  the computed var was approximately million as of december our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that could be recognized on our investment portfolios assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and are not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our investment portfolios during the year 
we believe  however  that any loss incurred would be substantially offset by the effects of interest rate movements on our liabilities  since these liabilities are affected by many of the same factors that affect asset performance  that is  economic activity  inflation and interest rates  as well as regional and industry factors 
in addition to the market risk associated with its investments  we have interest rate risk due to our fixed rate borrowings 
we use interest rate swap contracts swap contracts as a part of our hedging strategy to manage certain exposures related to the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of the million aggregated principal amount of our 
table of contents senior notes due on april  senior notes 
under the swap contracts  we agree to pay an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
the swap contracts are entered into with a number of major financial institutions in order to minimize counterparty credit risk 
on february   we entered into four swap contracts related to the senior notes 
the swap contracts have an aggregate notional amount of million and effectively convert the fixed interest rate on the senior notes to a variable rate equal to the six month london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
the swap contracts will be reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and the related senior notes will be reflected at an amount equal to the sum of their carrying value plus an adjustment representing the change in fair value of the senior notes attributable to the interest risk being hedged 
because the terms of the swaps match the terms of our senior notes  the changes in the fair value of the swaps offset the changes in the adjusted carrying value of our senior notes being hedged 
the net effect on our operating results will be that the interest expense on our senior notes is recorded based on variable interest rates 
the interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility  for which there are none as of december   is subject to change because of the varying interest rates that apply to borrowings under the credit facilities 
for additional information regarding our credit facilities  see financing activities 
our floating rate borrowings  if any  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interest rates paid on these accounts are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair value of our fixed rate borrowing as of december  was approximately million which was based on bid quotations from third party data providers 
the following table presents the expected cash outflows relating to market risk sensitive debt obligations as of december  these cash outflows include both expected principal and interest payments consistent with the terms of the outstanding debt as of december  prior to entering into the interest rate swap contracts
