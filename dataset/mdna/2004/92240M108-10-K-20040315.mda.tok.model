item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts overview we are a holding company for a number of businesses 
we are engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the united states through our subsidiary liggett group inc  and the development and marketing of the low nicotine and nicotine free quest cigarette products and the development of reduced risk cigarette products through our subsidiary vector tobacco inc during  the sales and marketing functions  along with certain support functions  of our liggett and vector tobacco subsidiaries were combined into a new entity  liggett vector brands inc this company coordinates and executes the sales and marketing efforts for all of our tobacco operations 
with the combined resources of liggett and vector tobacco  liggett vector brands has enhanced distribution and marketing capabilities 
in october  we announced that we would close vector tobacco s timberlake  north carolina cigarette manufacturing facility in order to reduce excess cigarette production capacity and improve operating efficiencies company wide 
production of quest and vector tobacco s other cigarette brands has been moved to liggett s state of the art manufacturing facility in mebane  north carolina 
we continue to explore various other opportunities to streamline the cost structure of our tobacco business and improve long term earnings 
such activities may result in additional restructuring and impairment charges 
our majority owned subsidiary  new valley corporation  is currently engaged in the real estate business and is seeking to acquire additional operating companies 
in december  new valley acquired two office buildings in princeton  new jersey and increased its ownership to in douglas elliman realty  llc  which operates the largest residential brokerage company in the new york metropolitan area 
our conventional cigarette business  liggett  shipped approximately billion cigarettes during which accounted for of the total cigarettes shipped in the united states during that year 
approximately of liggett s unit sales in were generated in the discount segment 
we believe that liggett has gained a sustainable cost advantage over its competitors through its various settlement agreements 
under the master settlement agreement reached in november with state attorneys general and various territories  liggett s four major competitors must make settlement payments to the states and territories based on how many cigarettes they sell annually 
liggett  however  is not required to make any payments unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us cigarette market 
additionally  as a result of the medallion acquisition  vector tobacco likewise has no payment obligation unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us market 
in recent years  the domestic tobacco business has experienced the following trends declining unit volumes due to health considerations  diminishing social acceptance of smoking  legislative limitations on smoking in public places  federal and state excise tax increases and settlement related expenses which have augmented cigarette prices  narrower price spreads between the premium and traditional discount segments resulting from aggressive premium price promotions by larger competitors including philip morris and rjr  while price spreads between the premium and deep discount markets widen due to the influx of smaller companies producing low quality  deep discount cigarettes  and loss of discount market share for branded discount cigarettes such as those sold by liggett due to a significant increase in market share by the smaller cigarette companies producing low quality  deep discount cigarettes 
in january  vector tobacco introduced quest  its brand of low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products 
quest is designed for adult smokers who are interested in reducing their levels of nicotine intake and is available in six different menthol and nonmenthol varieties  each with decreasing amounts of nicotine quest  and quest  the low nicotine variety  contains milligrams of nicotine 
quest  the extra low nicotine variety  contains milligrams of nicotine 
quest  the nicotine free variety  contains only trace levels of nicotine no more than milligrams of nicotine per cigarette 
quest cigarettes utilize a proprietary process that enables the production of nicotine free tobacco that tastes and smokes like tobacco in conventional cigarettes 
all six quest varieties are being sold in hard packs and are priced comparable to other premium brands 
quest is initially available in new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  ohio  indiana  illinois and michigan 
these seven states account for approximately of all cigarette sales in the united states 
a multi million dollar advertising and marketing campaign  with advertisements running in magazines and regional newspapers  supported the product launch 
the brand continues to be supported by significant point of purchase awareness campaigns  as well as store related and periodic newspaper advertisements 
the premium segment of the industry is currently experiencing intense competitive activity  with increased discounting of premium brands at all levels of retail 
given these marketplace conditions  and the results that we have seen to date with quest  we intend to take a measured approach to expanding the market presence of the brand 
in november  vector tobacco introduced three menthol varieties of quest in the seven state market 
in addition  we are utilizing the information that we have obtained since the introduction of the quest non menthol product to more specifically target our focus in the seven state market in the coming months 
based upon those results  the success of the menthol product and market conditions in the premium segment  we will make a determination on the timing of a national launch of quest at a later date 
vector tobacco also introduced quest and quest menthol into an expansion market in arizona in january arizona accounts for approximately of the industry volume nationwide 
quest brand cigarettes are currently marketed solely to permit adult smokers  who wish to continue smoking  to gradually reduce their intake of nicotine 
the products are not labeled or advertised for smoking cessation or as a safer form of smoking 
in october  we announced that jed e 
rose  phd  director of duke university medical center s nicotine research program and co inventor of the nicotine patch  had conducted a study at duke university medical center to provide preliminary evaluation of the use of the quest technology as a smoking cessation aid 
in the preliminary study on quest  of quest smokers were able to achieve four week continuous abstinence  a standard threshold for smoking cessation 
management believes these results show real promise for the quest technology as a smoking cessation aid and has asked the food and drug administration to supply us with guidance as to the additional research and regulatory filings necessary to market quest as a smoking cessation product 
in november  vector tobacco launched nationwide omni  the first reduced carcinogen cigarette that tastes  smokes and burns like other premium cigarettes 
the omni cigarettes are produced using a patent pending process developed by vector tobacco 
in comparison to comparable styles of the leading us cigarette brand  omni cigarettes produce significantly lower levels of many of the recognized carcinogens and toxins that the medical community has identified as major contributors to lung cancer and other diseases in smokers 
during  acceptance of omni in the marketplace was limited  with revenues of approximately  on sales of million units 
during  omni sales activity was minimal as vector tobacco has not been actively marketing the omni product 
vector tobacco was unable to achieve the anticipated breadth of distribution and sales of the omni product  due in part  to the lack of success of its advertising and marketing efforts in differentiating omni with consumers through the reduced carcinogen message 
over the next several years  our in house research program  together with third party collaborators  plans to conduct appropriate studies as to the human effects of omni s reduction of carcinogens and  based on these studies  management will review the marketing and positioning of the omni brand in order to formulate a strategy for its long term success 
recent developments vector tobacco restructuring 
on october   we announced that we would close vector tobacco s timberlake  north carolina cigarette manufacturing facility in order to reduce excess cigarette production capacity and improve operating efficiencies company wide 
production of the quest line of low nicotine and nicotine free cigarettes  as well as production of vector tobacco s other cigarette brands  has been moved to liggett s state of the art manufacturing facility in mebane  north carolina 
the mebane facility currently produces in excess of billion units per year  but maintains the capacity to produce approximately billion units per year 
vector tobacco has contracted with liggett to produce its cigarettes and has transitioned production from timberlake to mebane 
all production ceased at timberlake by december  as part of the transition  we eliminated approximately positions 
as a result of these actions  we currently expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately  beginning in we recognized pre tax restructuring and impairment charges of  in  and additional charges of approximately will be taken in the first quarter approximately  relate to employee severance and benefit costs  to contract termination and exit and moving costs  and  to non cash asset impairment charges 
machinery and equipment to be disposed of was reduced to fair value less costs to sell 
the asset impairment charges are based on management s current estimates of the values we will be able to realize on sales of excess machinery and equipment  and may be adjusted in future periods based on the actual amounts realized 
vector tobacco has entered into negotiations to sell the timberlake facility  including all equipment not relocated to mebane 
liggett vector brands 
during  the sales and marketing functions  along with certain support functions  of our liggett and vector tobacco subsidiaries were combined into a new entity  liggett vector brands inc this company coordinates and executes the sales and marketing efforts for all of our tobacco operations 
with the combined resources of liggett and vector tobacco  liggett vector brands has enhanced distribution and marketing capabilities 
in connection with the formation of the new liggett vector brands entity  we took a charge of approximately  in the first quarter of  related to the reorganization of our business 
as of march   these restructuring activities had been substantially completed 
acquisition of medallion 
on april   a subsidiary of ours acquired the stock of the medallion company  inc  and related assets from medallion s principal stockholder 
the total purchase price consisted of  in cash and  in notes  with the notes guaranteed by us and liggett 
medallion  a discount cigarette manufacturer  is a participant in the master settlement agreement between the state attorneys general and the tobacco industry 
medallion has no payment obligations under the master settlement agreement unless its market share exceeds approximately of total cigarettes sold in the united states 
vgr holding notes 
in connection with an amendment to the note purchase agreement for vgr holding s senior secured notes due march   vgr holding repurchased a total of  of the notes in the second quarter of and  of the notes on september   at a price of of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
we recognized losses of  in on the early extinguishment of debt 
tax matters 
in connection with the and transaction with philip morris incorporated where a subsidiary of liggett contributed three of its premium cigarette brands to trademarks llc  a newly formed limited liability company  we recognized in a pre tax gain of  in our consolidated financial statements and established a deferred tax liability of  relating to the gain 
in such transaction  philip morris acquired an option to purchase the remaining interest in trademarks for a day period commencing in december  and we have an option to require philip morris to purchase the remaining interest for a day period commencing in march upon exercise of the options during the day periods commencing in december or in march  we will be required to pay tax in the amount of the deferred tax liability  which will be offset by the benefit of any deferred tax assets  including any net operating losses  available to us at that time 
in connection with an examination of our and federal income tax returns  the internal revenue service issued to us in september a notice of proposed adjustment 
the notice asserts that  for tax reporting purposes  the entire gain should have been recognized in and in in the additional amounts of  and  respectively  rather than upon the exercise of the options during the day periods commencing in december or in march if the internal revenue service were to ultimately prevail with the proposed adjustment  it would result in the potential acceleration of tax payments of approximately  including interest  net of tax benefits  through december  these amounts have been previously recognized in our consolidated financial statements as tax liabilities 
as of december   we believe amounts potentially due have been fully provided for in our consolidated statements of operations 
we believe the positions reflected on our income tax returns are correct and intend to vigorously oppose any proposed adjustments to our returns 
we have filed a protest with the appeals division of the internal revenue service 
no payment is due with respect to these matters during the appeals process 
interest currently is accruing on the disputed amounts at a rate of  with the rate adjusted quarterly based on rates published by the us treasury department 
if taxing authorities were to ultimately prevail in their assertion that we incurred a tax obligation prior to the exercise dates of these options and we were required to make such tax payments prior to or  and if any necessary financing were not available to us  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
real estate acquisitions 
in december  new valley purchased two office buildings in princeton  new jersey for a total purchase price of  new valley financed a portion of the purchase price through a borrowing of  from hsbc realty credit corporation usa 
the loan has a term of four years  bears interest at a floating rate of above libor  and is collateralized by a first mortgage on the office buildings  as well as by an assignment of leases and rents 
principal is amortized to the extent of per month during the term of the loan 
the loan may be prepaid without penalty and is non recourse against new valley  except for various specified environmental and related matters  misapplications of tenant security deposits and insurance and condemnation proceeds  and fraud or misrepresentation by new valley in connection with the indebtedness 
also in december  new valley and the other owners of prudential douglas elliman real estate  formerly known as prudential long island realty  contributed their interests in prudential douglas elliman real estate to douglas elliman realty  formerly known as montauk battery realty llc  a newly formed entity 
new valley acquired a ownership interest in douglas elliman realty  an increase from its previous interest in prudential douglas elliman real estate as a result of an additional investment of  by new valley and the redemption by prudential douglas elliman real estate of various ownership interests 
in march  douglas elliman realty purchased the leading new york city based residential brokerage firm  douglas elliman  llc  formerly known as insignia douglas elliman  and an affiliated property management company for  with that acquisition  the combination of prudential douglas elliman real estate with douglas elliman has created the largest residential brokerage company in the new york metropolitan area 
new valley invested an additional  in subordinated debt and equity of douglas elliman realty to help fund the acquisition 
the subordinated debt  which has a principal amount of  bears interest at per annum and is due in march recent developments in legislation  regulation and litigation the cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts 
new cases continue to be commenced against liggett and other cigarette manufacturers 
as of december   there were approximately individual suits  purported class actions and governmental and other third party payor health care reimbursement actions pending in the united states in which liggett was a named defendant 
a civil lawsuit has been filed by the united states federal government seeking disgorgement of approximately  from various cigarette manufacturers  including liggett 
in addition to these cases  in  an action against cigarette manufacturers involving approximately  named individual plaintiffs was consolidated before a single west virginia state court 
liggett is a defendant in most of the cases pending in west virginia 
in january  the court severed liggett from the trial of the consolidated action 
there are eight individual actions where liggett is the only defendant  with three of these cases currently scheduled for trial between april and august approximately purported class action complaints have been filed against the cigarette manufacturers for alleged antitrust violations 
as new cases are commenced  the costs associated with defending these cases and the risks relating to the inherent unpredictability of litigation continue to increase 
in may  a florida intermediate appellate court overturned a  punitive damages award against liggett and decertified the engle smoking and health class action 
class counsel is pursuing various appellate remedies seeking to reverse the appellate court s decision 
if the appellate court s ruling is not upheld on further appeal  it will have a material adverse effect on us 
in november  liggett filed the  bond required under the bonding statute enacted in by the florida legislature which limits the size of any bond required  pending appeal  to stay execution of a punitive damages verdict 
in may  liggett reached an agreement with the class in the engle case  which provided assurance to liggett that the stay of execution  in effect under the florida bonding statute  would not be lifted or limited at any point until completion of all appeals  including to the united states supreme court 
as required by the agreement  liggett paid  into an escrow account to be held for the benefit of the engle class  and released  along with liggett s existing  statutory bond  to the court for the benefit of the class upon completion of the appeals process  regardless of the outcome of the appeal 
in june  the jury in an individual case brought under the third phase of the engle case awarded  subsequently reduced by the court to  of compensatory damages against liggett and two other defendants and found liggett responsible for the damages 
the verdict  which is subject to the outcome of the engle appeal  has been overturned as a result of the appellate court s ruling discussed above 
it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
management cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
in recent years  there have been a number of restrictive regulatory actions from various federal administrative bodies  including the united states environmental protection agency and the food and drug administration 
there have also been adverse political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry  including the commencement and certification of class actions and the commencement of third party payor actions 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
we are not able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation  but our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any smoking related litigation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of legislation  regulation and litigation 
critical accounting policies general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
significant estimates subject to material changes in the near term include restructuring and impairment charges  inventory valuation  deferred tax assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  promotional accruals  sales returns and allowances  actuarial assumptions of pension plans  settlement accruals and litigation and defense costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of cigarettes are recognized upon the shipment of finished goods to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sale price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide an allowance for expected sales returns  net of related inventory cost recoveries 
since our primary line of business is tobacco  our financial position and our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be materially adversely effected by significant unit sales volume declines  litigation and defense costs  increased tobacco costs or reductions in the selling price of cigarettes in the near term 
effective january   we adopted new required accounting standards mandating that certain sales incentives previously reported as operating  selling  general and administrative expenses be shown as a reduction of operating revenues 
the adoption of the new accounting standards did not have an impact on our net earnings or basic or diluted earnings per share 
marketing costs 
we record marketing costs as an expense in the period to which such costs relate 
we do not defer the recognition of any amounts on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to marketing costs 
we expense advertising costs as incurred  which is the period in which the related advertisement initially appears 
we record consumer incentive and trade promotion costs as an expense in the period in which these programs are offered  based on estimates of utilization and redemption rates that are developed from historical information 
as discussed above under revenue recognition  beginning january   we have adopted the previously mentioned revenue recognition accounting standards that mandate that certain costs previously reported as marketing expense be shown as a reduction of operating revenues 
the adoption of the new accounting standards did not have an impact on our net earnings or basic or diluted earnings per share 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset  or related group of assets  may not be fully recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances include a significant adverse charge in the manner in which a long lived asset  or group of assets  is being used or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset  or group of assets  will be disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life 
in october  we announced that we would close vector tobacco s timberlake  north carolina cigarette manufacturing and produce its cigarette products at liggett s mebane  north carolina facility 
we have evaluated the net realizable value of the long lived assets located at the timberlake facility which will no longer be used in operations 
based on management s current estimates of the values we will be able to realize on sales of the excess machinery and equipment  we have recognized non cash asset impairment charges of  in the third quarter of the estimate of fair value of these long lived assets is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets and the results of using other valuation techniques 
such asset impairment charges may be adjusted in future periods based on the actual amounts realized 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long lived assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated 
contingencies 
we record liggett s product liability legal expenses and other litigation costs as operating  selling  general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements and above under the heading recent developments in legislation  regulation and litigation  legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various jurisdictions against liggett 
management is unable to make a meaningful estimate with respect to the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending smoking related litigation or the costs of defending such cases  and we have not provided any amounts in our consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such smoking related litigation 
settlement agreements 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  liggett and vector tobacco are participants in the master settlement agreement  the agreement to settle governmental healthcare cost recovery actions brought by various states 
liggett and vector tobacco have no payment obligations under the master settlement agreement except to the extent their market shares exceed approximately and  respectively  of total cigarettes sold in the united states 
their obligations  and the related expense charges under the master settlement agreement  are subject to adjustments based upon  among other things  the volume of cigarettes sold by liggett and vector tobacco  their relative market shares and inflation 
since relative market shares are based on cigarette shipments  the best estimate of the allocation of charges under the master settlement agreement is recorded in cost of goods sold as the products are shipped 
settlement expenses under the master settlement agreement recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were  for   for and  for adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
inventories 
tobacco inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined primarily by the last in  first out lifo method at liggett and the first in  first out fifo method at vector tobacco 
at december   approximately  of our inventory was associated with vector tobacco s new product initiatives 
although portions of leaf tobacco inventories may not be used or sold within one year because of time required for aging  they are included in current assets  which is common practice in the industry 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
employee benefit plans 
since  income from our defined benefit pension plans  partially offset by the costs of postretirement medical and life insurance benefits  have contributed to our reported operating income up to and including the determination of our net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized income or expense in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our future net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense 
based on the declines in the securities markets  we recorded a non cash charge of  net of tax to stockholders equity in the fourth quarter of relating primarily to one of liggett s defined benefit plans 
the charge was based on the extent to which our accumulated benefit obligations under the pension plan on september  exceeded the fair value of the pension plan s assets on that date 
net pension expense for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit expense aggregated approximately  for  and we currently anticipate such expense will be approximately  for in contrast  our funding obligations under the pension plans are governed by erisa 
to comply with erisa s minimum funding requirements  we do not currently anticipate that we will be required to make any funding to the pension plans for the pension plan year beginning on january  and ending on december  any additional funding obligation that we may have for subsequent years is contingent on several factors and is not reasonably estimable at this time 
results of operations the following discussion provides an assessment of our results of operations  capital resources and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of vgr holding  liggett  vector tobacco  liggett vector brands  new valley and other less significant subsidiaries

the decline in liggett s premium sales revenue during the and periods reflects both the decrease in sales volume of premium priced cigarettes and increased promotional spending on premium brands driven primarily by weak economic conditions  substantial excise tax increases in many states  and significant promotional and pricing activity from the major us cigarette manufacturers 
also impacting the decline in net revenues was the shift from significant free goods activity in recorded in cost of goods sold to other promotional activity recorded as a reduction of revenue in discount sales at liggett comprising the brand categories of branded discount  private label  control label  generic  international and contract manufacturing in amounted to  and represented of total liggett sales  compared to  and of total liggett sales for in the discount segment  revenues grew by  for the year ended december  compared to  due to net price increases of  and to a favorable product mix among the discount brand categories of  partially offset by a decrease in unit sales volume approximately million units accounting for  in unfavorable volume variances

the total cost of these upgrades was approximately  liggett took delivery of the first two of the new lines in the fourth quarter of and financed the purchase price of  through the issuance of notes  guaranteed by us and payable in monthly installments of with interest calculated at the prime rate

liggett has received option fees of  of which is refundable if the purchaser terminates the agreement prior to august  liggett will be entitled to receive additional option fees of up to during the remaining option period 
the option fees will generally be creditable against the purchase price 
the purchaser is currently conducting due diligence  and there can be no assurance the sale of the property will occur 
liggett and  in certain cases  brooke group holding  our predecessor and a wholly owned subsidiary of vgr holding and other united states cigarette manufacturers have been named as defendants in a number of direct and third party actions and purported class actions predicated on the theory that they should be liable for damages from cancer and other adverse health effects alleged to have been caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to so called secondary smoke from cigarettes 
we believe  and have been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases  that brooke group holding and liggett have a number of valid defenses to claims asserted against them 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties 
in may  a florida intermediate appellate court overturned a  punitive damages award against liggett and decertified the engle smoking and health class action 
class counsel is pursuing various appellate remedies seeking to reverse the appellate court s decision 
if the appellate court s ruling is not upheld on further appeal  it will have a material adverse effect on us 
in november  liggett filed the  bond required under the bonding statute enacted in by the florida legislature which limits the size of any bond required  pending appeal  to stay execution of a punitive damages verdict 
in may  liggett reached an agreement with the class in the engle case  which provided assurance to liggett that the stay of execution  in effect pursuant to the florida bonding statute  would not be lifted or limited at any point until completion of all appeals  including to the united states supreme court 
as required by the agreement  liggett paid  into an escrow account to be held for the benefit of the engle class  and released  along with liggett s existing  statutory bond  to the court for the benefit of the class upon completion of the appeals process  regardless of the outcome of the appeal 
in june  the jury in an individual case brought under the third phase of the engle case awarded  subsequently reduced by the court to  of compensatory damages against liggett and two other defendants and found liggett responsible for the damages 
the verdict  which was subject to the outcome of the engle appeal  has been overturned as a result of the appellate court s ruling discussed above 
it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
management cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
an unfavorable outcome of a pending smoking and health case could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation 
in recent years  there have been a number of adverse regulatory  political and other developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
neither we nor liggett are able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation or regulation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the cases pending against brooke group holding or liggett or the costs of defending such cases 
it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such tobacco related litigation

vector 
we believe that we will continue to meet our liquidity requirements through  although the covenants in the purchase agreement for vgr holding s notes limit the ability of vgr holding to make distributions to us unless certain tests are met 
under the terms of these covenants  at december   vgr holding was generally not permitted to pay distributions to us except for tax sharing payments and specified amounts of operating expenses 
corporate expenditures exclusive of liggett  vector research  vector tobacco and new valley over the next twelve months for current operations include cash interest expense of approximately  dividends on our outstanding shares currently at an annual rate of approximately  and corporate expenses 
we anticipate funding our expenditures for current operations with available cash resources  proceeds from public and or private debt and equity financing  management fees from subsidiaries and tax sharing and other payments from liggett or new valley 
new valley may acquire or seek to acquire additional operating businesses through merger  purchase of assets  stock acquisition or other means  or to make other investments  which may limit its ability to make such distributions 
in july  we completed the sale of  net proceeds of approximately  of our convertible subordinated notes due july  through a private offering to qualified institutional investors in accordance with rule a under the securities act of the notes pay interest at per annum and are convertible into our common stock  at the option of the holder 
the conversion price  which was at december   is subject to adjustment for various events  and any cash distribution on our common stock results in a corresponding decrease in the conversion price 
in december   of the notes were converted into our common stock  and  principal amount of the notes were outstanding at december  our consolidated balance sheets include deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which represent temporary differences in the application of accounting rules established by generally accepted accounting principles and income tax laws 
as of december   our deferred income tax liabilities exceeded our deferred income tax assets by  the largest component of our deferred tax liabilities exists because of differences that resulted from a and transaction with philip morris incorporated where a subsidiary of liggett contributed three of its premium brands to trademarks llc  a newly formed limited liability company 
in such transaction  philip morris acquired an option to purchase the remaining interest in trademarks for a day period commencing in december  and we have an option to require philip morris to purchase the remaining interest commencing in march for additional information concerning the philip morris brand transaction  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the transaction  we recognized in a pre tax gain of  in our consolidated financial statements and established a deferred tax liability of  relating to the gain 
upon exercise of the options during the day periods commencing in december or in march  we will be required to pay tax in the amount of the deferred tax liability  which will be offset by the benefit of any deferred tax assets  including any net operating losses  available to us at that time 
in connection with an examination of our and federal income tax returns  the internal revenue service issued to us in september a notice of proposed adjustment 
the notice asserts that  for tax reporting purposes  the entire gain should have been recognized in and in in the additional amounts of  and  respectively  rather than upon the exercise of the options during the day periods commencing in december or in march if the internal revenue service were to ultimately prevail with the proposed adjustment  it would result in the potential acceleration of tax payments of approximately  including interest  net of tax benefits  through december  these amounts have been previously recognized in our consolidated financial statements as tax liabilities 
as of december   we believe amounts potentially due have been fully provided for in our consolidated statements of operations 
we believe the positions reflected on our income tax returns are correct and intend to vigorously oppose any proposed adjustments to our returns 
we have filed a protest with the appeals division of the internal revenue service 
no payment is due with respect to these matters during the appeal process 
interest currently is accruing on the disputed amounts at a rate of  with the rate adjust quarterly based on rates published by the us treasury department 
if taxing authorities were to ultimately prevail in their assertion that we incurred a tax obligation prior to the exercise dates of these options and we were required to make such tax payments prior to or  and if any necessary financing were not available to us  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
long term financial obligations and other commercial commitments our significant long term contractual obligations as of december  were as follows fiscal year contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt        operating leases        inventory purchase commitments   capital expenditure purchase commitments new valley obligations under limited partnership agreements   total        for more information concerning our long term debt  see liquidity and capital resources above and note to our consolidated financial statements 
operating lease obligations represent estimated lease payments for facilities and equipment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
inventory purchase commitments represent purchase commitments under our leaf inventory management program 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditure purchase commitments represent purchase commitments for machinery and equipment at liggett and vector tobacco 
payments under the master settlement agreement discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements are excluded from the table above  as the payments are subject to adjustment for several factors  including inflation  overall industry volume  our market share and the market share of non participating manufacturers 
off balance sheet arrangements we have various agreements in which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights 
payment by us under such indemnification clauses is generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to challenge by us and dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time and or amount  and in some instances  we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under these agreements have not been material 
as of december   we were not aware of any indemnification agreements that would or are reasonably expected to have a current or future material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  in connection with the philip morris brand transaction  eve holdings inc  a subsidiary of liggett  guaranteed a  bank loan to trademarks llc 
the loan is secured by trademarks three premium cigarette brands and trademarks interest in the exclusive license of the three brands by philip morris 
the license provides for a minimum annual royalty payment equal to the annual debt service on the loan plus  we believe that the fair value of eve s guarantee was negligible at december  at december   we had outstanding approximately  of letters of credit  collateralized by certificates of deposit 
the letters of credit have been issued as security deposits for leases of office space  to secure the performance of our subsidiaries under various insurance programs and to provide collateral for various subsidiary borrowing and capital lease arrangements 
market risk we are exposed to market risks principally from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we seek to minimize these risks through our regular operating and financing activities and our long term investment strategy 
the market risk management procedures of us and new valley cover all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as of december   approximately  of our outstanding debt had variable interest rates  which increases the risk of fluctuating interest rates 
our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our variable rate borrowings  which could adversely affect our cash flows 
as of december   we had no interest rate caps or swaps 
based on a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by approximately we held investment securities available for sale totaling  at december  adverse market conditions could have a significant effect on the value of these investments 
new valley also holds long term investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies 
these investments are illiquid  and their ultimate realization is subject to the performance of the investee entities
