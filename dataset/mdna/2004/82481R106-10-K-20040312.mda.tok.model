overview shire s revenues are derived from product sales and royalties received on products that have been out licensed to third parties 
the company is organized into five operating segments us  international  r d  biologics and corporate 
the company currently focuses its activities on three therapeutic areas central nervous system disorders  gastrointestinal and renal 
following a detailed strategic review conducted in  the company has revised its strategic priority 
shire will search  develop and market but will not invent 
the company will seek to acquire products with substantive patent protection rather than just three years hatch waxman exclusivity 
the company will also focus its in licensing and merger and acquisition m a efforts on the us market  and obtain european rights whenever possible 
shire has refocused its research and development r d efforts and technology to concentrate on areas where it has a commercial presence and is creating the flexibility to add new therapeutic areas based on product acquisition opportunities 
the strategic review thoroughly evaluated the group s pipeline and refocused resources on four projects  which are currently in phase ii and iii of development 
this approach aims to deliver the combined benefit of increased returns and lower risks 
the implementation of these actions has resulted in the exit from early research stage therapeutic  which was completed in the third quarter of  the planned exit from the vaccines business  which shire is targeting to achieve around mid year these changes have implications for both the group s organizational structure and operating sites 
the company has a new global management structure aimed at close interaction between development  marketing and sales  and new people in key positions reporting directly to the chief executive officer 
in addition  the company has advanced its plans to reduce the number of north american sites from fourteen to four  including the opening of a new us headquarters office on the east coast 
pennsylvania is currently being considered in this regard 
the company will close its sites in newport  kentucky and rockville  maryland 
shire s world headquarters will continue to be located in basingstoke  uk 
the cost of the planned reorganization in is estimated at approximately million split between retaining and relocating key staff to the new us headquarters  and site closure costs and other relocation expenses 
the majority of these costs will be charged as part of operating expenses 
it is anticipated that these changes will improve both the efficiency of operation and the cost structure of the group going forward recognizing shire s strategic intent to focus on north america and europe  the company has sought out licensing partners to cover the japanese market 
the company has successfully out licensed the japanese marketing and development rights for agrylin and fosrenol to two companies with an established presence in this market 
the company s new strategy is designed to face competitive pressures from what it deems to be its two most likely sources companies with more resources and larger research and development expenditures 
these companies may have an improved likelihood of obtaining approval of drugs that would compete with shire s drugs 
prior regulatory approvals for competing products would force the shire s development products to compete with an established drug 
other products now in use or under development by others may be more effective or have fewer side effects than the company s current or future products 
low cost generic drugs 
in  an analyst estimated that approximately of prescriptions were written for generic products  and anticipated that this percentage would continue to increase 
the pharmaceutical industry itself is also experiencing increasing pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep prices low  increasing r d costs as clinical studies are typically larger and take longer  and increasing marketing costs due to the use of direct to consumer campaigns and competition for share of voice

during the year ended december   shire repurchased million of the convertible loan notes 
the convertible notes are guaranteed by shire and are convertible into redeemable preference shares of the issuer which upon issuance will be immediately exchanged for either i shire ordinary shares or ii shire adss  or iii at the issuer s option  a cash amount based upon the london stock exchange volume weighted average prices of ordinary shares on the fourth through eighth business days following conversion 
at the choice of investors  each  of nominal value notes can be converted into shire ordinary shares subject to adjustment or shire adss subject to adjustment at any time up to august  alternatively  investors can choose to receive repayment of the nominal principal in cash either at the maturity date of august  or by exercising a put option on any of the three put dates being august   august  and august  at shire s option  repayment can be made in the form of ordinary shares or adss 
the number of ordinary shares that a note holder would receive would be based on the notional principal of the notes divided by of the london stock exchange volume weighted average price of ordinary shares on the five trading days after the company gives notice of the exercise of its option 
such notice will be on or before the tenth business day preceding the repayment put date 
on or after august   shire may redeem  for cash  all or part of the notes providing the ordinary share price has exceeded sterling equivalent at the time for of the consecutive dealing days in the period prior to redemption 
the decision as to whether a note holder should exercise a put option will depend on a number of factors  particularly the price of the company s shares at the put date and the likelihood of this share price exceeding the conversion threshold price 
the conversion threshold price is equivalent to or at the closing exchange rate for for shire ordinary shares and for shire adss 
if the price of the company s ordinary shares at the first put date of august  remains at a level similar to the year end price of for shire adss it is quite possible that note holders will choose to exercise their put options

the conversion threshold price is equivalent to or at the closing exchange rate for for shire ordinary shares and for shire adss

new accounting pronouncements adopted in the current year in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections sfas no 
the principal change reflected in these pronouncements is that gains or losses from extinguishment of debt which were classified as extraordinary items by sfas no 
are no longer classified as such 
the company adopted sfas no 
during the current year 
when adopted  prior extraordinary items relating to the extinguishment of debt were reclassified 
this resulted in the extraordinary items of million million before taxes and million of income taxes in being reclassified to the interest expense and income taxes  respectively 
to be adopted in future periods in december  the fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r or the interpretation 
fin r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
consolidated financial statements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities  by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
among other changes  fin r a clarified some requirements of the original fin which had been issued in january  b eased some implementation problems and c added new exceptions 
fin r deferred the effective date of the interpretation for public companies to the end of the first reporting period after march  except that all public companies must  at a minimum  apply the provisions of the interpretation to all entities that were previously considered special purpose entities under the fasb literature prior to the issuance of fin r by the end of the first reporting period ending after december  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on its financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the way the company applies its accounting policies 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that would have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods 
the accounting policies  which the company considers to be critical accounting policies  include litigation  valuation of intangible assets  valuation of fixed asset investments  sales deductions and income taxes 
litigation shire accounts for litigation losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss 
where the estimated loss lies within a range and no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum amount is recorded 
in other cases management s best estimate of the loss is recorded 
these estimates are developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  in light of additional information being known 
in instances where shire is unable to develop a best estimate of loss  no litigation loss is recorded at that time 
as information becomes known a loss provision is set up when a best estimate can be made 
the best estimates are reviewed quarterly and the estimates are changed when expectations are revised 
any outcome upon settlement that deviates from shire s best estimate may result in an additional expense in a future accounting period 
during the year ended december   a legal accrual of million was released in the aggregate  to the consolidated statement of operations  due to the outcome of previously pending litigation 
valuation of intangible assets shire has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that shire records at acquisition cost 
as of december   the carrying value of such intangibles was million  which primarily related to agrylin  carbatrol  colazide  fareston  methypatch  proamatine  pentasa and solaraze products 
those assets which do not yet have a defined revenue stream and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed upon acquisition as acquired in process research and development  and those that do have a defined revenue stream namely commercial products or rights to products awaiting final regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life 
management s estimate of the useful life considers  inter alia  the following factors the expected use of the asset by the entity  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life and the effects of demand  competition  and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels 
there is a high occurrence of transactions involving the transfer of intangible assets between companies in the health care field  and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
shire uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets acquired and for the assessment of impairment 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
shire engages independent valuation experts who review shire s critical assumptions for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
shire reviews intangible assets for impairment periodically using an undiscounted net cash flows approach whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its estimated discounted cash flow value 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
a prolonged general economic downturn and  specifically  competitive pricing pressure  could create an imbalance of industry supply and demand  or otherwise diminish volumes or profits 
such events  combined with changes in interest rates  could adversely affect shire s estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by its long lived assets 
consequently  it is possible that future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by additional impairment charges related to the recoverability of long lived assets 
changes to the estimated future net cash flows from certain products resulted in a million impairment of intangible assets in the year ended december  million and million 
the estimated net cash flows for all three years changed as a result of strategic business decisions by shire that resulted in a redirection of resources away from certain products that were no longer believed to be core to its business and to products that shire believed to be more profitable and in line with its strategic direction 
in addition a decline in certain product prices and a decision not to renew product licenses that were not core to the business had a negative impact on the estimated net cash flows 
valuation of fixed asset investments the company has certain investments in equity securities 
all equity investments  where shire does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and where the equity securities are not marketable  are accounted for under the cost method 
at december  the carrying value of investments accounted for under the cost method was million 
under the cost method  investments in private companies are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
for public companies  the company classifies its equity investments as available for sale and  accordingly  records these investments at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of any related tax effect 
shire periodically reviews its fixed asset investments for other than temporary impairments whenever certain events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an investment exceeds the fair market value of the investment 
indicators of other than temporary impairments include the market value of a quoted investment being below the carrying value of the investment for an extended period  adverse news flow for private company investments in relation to the progress of scientific technology development of compounds  and recent stock issuances at a price below the investment price 
if the fair value appears to be below the carrying value the company consider all available evidence in assessing whether there is an other than temporary impairment 
this evidence would include positive progress in the issuer s scientific technology development of compounds  ongoing activity in collaborations with the issuer  a lack of other substantial company specific adverse events causing a decline in value  analysis and valuation of comparable companies  and the overall financial condition of the issuer 
in instances where the company s review indicates that there is an other than temporary impairment  shire writes down the investment to the then fair value of the investment  recording an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations 
the determination of the fair value of private company investments together with the determination of whether an unrealized loss is permanent requires significant judgment and can have a material impact on the reported results 
during  shire wrote off investments of million million and recorded an impairment of million million based on changes in its estimates of the carrying value from the previous year 
there were no such write offs or impairments  other than those associated with the acquisition of biochem  recorded in sales deductions sales deductions primarily consist of statutory rebates to state medicaid and other government agencies  contractual rebates with health maintenance organizations hmos  product returns  trade discounts and allowances for the coupon sampling program 
statutory rebates to state medicaid agencies and contractual rebates with hmos are based on price differentials between a base price and the selling price 
as a result  the rebates increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product 
provision for rebates are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from historical trends 
provisions for product returns and trade discounts to customers are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates based upon past activity levels  the duration of time in the processing of deductions other factors such as the launch of a new drug  the loss of patent protection or new competition 
where such factors are relevant  shire develops provisions for returns based on wholesaler customer channel checks for slow moving product and a separate management review of estimated customer inventory levels  by product 
to the extent that shire is unable to estimate returns  recognition of revenue is deferred until either the product is sold to the pharmacy or until shire receives payment from the wholesaler 
shire accepts customer returns in the following circumstances a expiration of product  or b product damaged while in the possession of shire  or c specific sales terms  at product launch  that allow for unconditional return of product guaranteed sales 
customers return periods range from one to twenty four months with an average return period of six months 
in addition  shire monitors customer inventory levels  based on estimated prescription demand  and limits the amount of product shipped to a customer when there appears to be a protracted pattern of customer ordering that exceeds shire s estimate of underlying demand 
the practice of monitoring inventory levels allows shire to more accurately predict customer returns 
the actual experience and the level of these deductions to revenue may deviate from the estimate 
shire revises its estimates every period and may be required to adjust the estimate in a subsequent period 
there have been no material adjustments to the estimates recognized related to shire s provisions for sales rebates or returns  in any of the periods presented 
income taxes shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments 
because shire operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country 
the company employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
the company also has significant deferred assets due to net operating losses nol s in the united states  canada and other countries 
the realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the future 
management has exercised judgment in determining the extent of the realization of these losses based upon estimates of future taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which these nol s exist 
where there is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities there will not be sufficient taxable profits to utilize these nol s a valuation allowance has been made against these deferred tax assets 
if actual events differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  any changes to the valuation allowance could materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
due to changes in estimates of shire s ability to utilize nol s in the future  shire recorded an additional release in valuation allowance of approximately million in and released valuation allowances of approximately million in the changes in estimates were a consequence of tax planning strategies entered into by shire and based on revised projections of operating results by tax jurisdiction 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded a valuation allowance of million against this amount 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded a valuation allowance of million against this amount 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded a valuation allowance of million against this amount

all treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and procedures approved by the board 
as a matter of policy  the company does not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its currency or interest rate exposure 
the company is subject to market risk in the following areas interest rate risk due to the high proportion of fixed rate debt  the company s interest charge has limited exposure to interest rate movements 
the convertible notes bear interest of per annum  payable semi annually 
this interest rate is fixed over the period of the debt  thus reducing any cash flow risk associated with movements in interest rates 
the interest rate risk that has been mitigated by obtaining a fixed rate debt is equivalent to a million saving per rise in interest rates per annum 
conversely a fall in interest rates by will effectively cost the company million 
in the year ended december   the average interest rate received on cash and liquid investments was approximately per annum 
the largest proportion of investments was in us dollar institutional funds 
foreign exchange risk the company is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar for trading transactions and the translation of net assets and earnings of non us subsidiaries
