overview we provide integrated computer systems for in house and outsourced data processing to commercial banks  credit unions and other financial institutions 
we have developed and acquired banking and credit union application software systems that we market  together with compatible computer hardware  to these financial institutions 
we also perform data conversion and software installation for the implementation of our systems and provide continuing customer support services after the systems are installed 
for our customers who prefer not to make an up front capital investment in software and hardware  we provide our full range of products and services on an outsourced basis through our seven data centers and item processing centers located throughout the united states 
we derive revenues from three primary sources of revenue sales of software licenses  support and service fees  which include installation services  and hardware sales 
over the last five fiscal years  our revenues have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal income from continuing operations has grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion supplemented by strategic acquisitions  allowing us to develop and acquire new products and services and expand the number of customers who use our core software systems to approximately  as of june  since the start of our fiscal year  we have completed twelve accretive acquisitions 
eleven of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies from their respective acquisition dates 
the remaining acquisition was accounted for using the pooling of interests method 
license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer 
we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a non exclusive  non transferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location 
in revenue arrangements with multiple elements  the components are all separately and independently priced within the related contracts 
allocation of revenue is consistent with pricing when each product or service is sold separately establishing vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
generally  a deposit is payable upon execution of the license agreement with additional payments due at specified times after contract signing 
we recognize software license revenue upon delivery and acceptance of the software and documentation 
support and services fees are generated from installation services contracted with us by the customer  ongoing support services to assist the customer in operating the systems and to enhance and update the software  and from providing outsourced data processing services and atm and debit card processing services 
we recognize installation services revenue as services are performed under hourly contracts and at the completion of the installations under fixed fee contracts 
revenues from software support are generated pursuant to annual agreements and are recognized ratably over the life of the agreements 
outsourcing services are performed through data and item centers 
revenues from outsourced item and data processing and atm and debit card processing services are derived from monthly usage fees typically under five year service contracts with our customers

cost of services represents costs associated with conversion and installation efforts  ongoing support for our in house customers  operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers  atm and debit card processing services  and direct operation costs 
these costs are recognized as they are incurred 
we have entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware and related services to our customers 
revenues from hardware sales are recognized when the manufacturers ship the hardware directly to our customers 
cost of hardware consists of the direct and related costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers 
these costs are recognized at the same time as the related revenue 
we have two business segments bank systems and services and credit union systems and services 
the respective segments include all related license  support and service  and hardware sales along with the related cost of sales

critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies as discussed below require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that could materially affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we record revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenue from sales of hardware  software and services and from arrangements involving multiple elements of each of the above 
revenue for multiple element arrangements is recorded based on contractual amounts  which are determined based upon the price charged when sold separately 
revenue is not recognized until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
sales of hardware and equipment are recorded when title and risk of loss transfers 
licensing revenues are recorded upon delivery and acceptance of the software 
service fees for training and installation are recognized as the services are provided 
support revenues are recorded evenly over the related contract period 
as discussed previously in the overview  the company has established vsoe separately for all the individual components of licensing  installation  support  and hardware and recognizes revenue separately for the various components 
the components are all independently priced and consistent with pricing when each element is sold separately 
there are no rights of return  conditions of acceptance or price protections in our contracts 
the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists 
we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term  but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company s future consolidated operating results 
all long lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled periodic basis

undue reliance should not be placed on the forward looking statements

potential risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect the company include the financial health of the banking industry  our ability to continue or effectively manage growth  adapting our products and services to changes in technology  changes in our strategic relationships  price competition  loss of key employees  consolidation in the banking industry  increased government regulation  network or internet security problems  declining computer hardware prices  and operational problems in our outsourcing facilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on investments in us government securities
