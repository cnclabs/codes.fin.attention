critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from software licensing arrangements where the service element is considered essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement is accounted for under the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type contracts and certain production type contracts 
sop requires that management make estimates of the total value of the contract as well as the percentage of the contract that has been completed as of the end of each period 
changes in circumstances may cause management s estimates of the value of the contract or the effort required to complete the services to change 
the changes may cause allscripts to adjust upward or downward the amount of revenue recognized or recognize less revenue than anticipated through the completion of the project 
in november  eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf was issued 
eitf addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
eitf is applicable to agreements entered into in quarters beginning after june  our customer arrangements in the information services segment encompass multiple deliverables 
we account for these arrangements in accordance with eitf if the deliverables meet the criteria in eitf  the deliverables are separated into separate units of accounting and revenue is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative fair values 
the criteria specified in eitf are that the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
applicable revenue recognition criteria is considered separately for each separate unit of accounting 
management applies judgment to ensure appropriate application of eitf  including value allocation among multiple deliverables  determination of whether undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered elements and timing of revenue recognition  among others 
for those arrangements where the deliverables do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  revenue from all deliverables are treated as one accounting unit and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement 
changes in circumstances and customer data may affect management s analysis of eitf criteria  which may cause allscripts to adjust upward or downward the 
table of contents amount of revenue recognized under the arrangement 
the adoption of eitf during the second half of did not have a significant effect on our revenue recognition in our information services segment due to the methodology utilized prior to eitf having very similar accounting treatment for multiple deliverables 
for a more complete description of our revenue recognition policy  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we rely on estimates to determine our bad debt expense and the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
these estimates are based on our historical experience and the industry in which we operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required 
inventories we adjust the value of our inventory downward for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate the value of intangible assets based upon the present value of the future economic benefits expected to be derived from the assets 
we assess the impairment of the identifiable intangibles and goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if we determine that the value of the intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable from future cash flows  a write down of the value of the asset may be required 
we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets and amortize the value over that estimated life 
if the actual useful life is shorter than our estimated useful life  we will amortize the remaining book value over the remaining useful life or the asset may be deemed to be impaired and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset may be required 
software capitalization the carrying value of capitalized software is dependent upon the ability to recover its value through future revenue from the sale of the software 
if we determine in the future that the value of the capitalized software could not be recovered  a write down of the value of the capitalized software to its recoverable value may be required 
we estimate the useful life of our capitalized software and amortize the value over that estimated life 
if the actual useful life is shorter than our estimated useful life  we will amortize the remaining book value over the remaining useful life or the asset may be deemed to be impaired and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset may be required

table of contents risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this report 
these are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business operations 
if any of these risks or uncertainties occurs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to allscripts healthcare solutions  inc if physicians do not accept our products and services  or delay in making decisions regarding the purchase of our products and services  our growth will be impaired 
our business model depends on our ability to sell our touchworks  physicians interactive and aic products and services to physicians and other healthcare providers and to generate usage by a large number of physicians 
we have not achieved this goal with previous or currently available versions of our touchworks  physicians interactive and aic products and services 
physician acceptance of our products and services will require physicians to adopt different behavior patterns and new methods of conducting business and exchanging information 
we cannot assure you that physicians will integrate our products and services into their office work flow or that participants in the pharmaceutical healthcare market will accept our products and services as a replacement for traditional methods of conducting healthcare transactions 
achieving market acceptance for our products and services will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant financial and other resources to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry 
if we fail to achieve broad acceptance of our products and services by physicians and other healthcare participants or if we fail to position our services as a preferred method for pharmaceutical healthcare delivery and information management  our prospects for growth will be diminished 
the duration of the sales cycle for our current touchworks product  document imaging and scanning solutions  and physician education services depends on a number of factors  including the nature and size of the potential customer and the extent of the commitment being made by the potential customer  and is difficult to predict 
our marketing efforts with respect to large healthcare organizations generally involve a lengthy sales cycle due to these organizations complex decision making processes 
additionally  in the wake of increased government involvement in healthcare  and related changes in the operating environment for healthcare organizations  our current and potential customers may react by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for our services 
if potential customers take longer than we expect to decide whether to purchase our solutions  our selling expenses could increase  and we may need to raise additional capital sooner than we would otherwise need to 
we have historically experienced losses and we may not be profitable in the future 
we have historically experienced losses and cannot assure you that we will become profitable in the near future  if ever 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of  we cannot be certain that we will achieve profitability  and even if we do achieve profitability  we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future 
because our business model is unproven  our operating history is not indicative of our future performance  and our business is difficult to evaluate 
because our business model has changed and evolved in recent years  we do not have an extensive operating history upon which you can evaluate our prospects 
in implementing our business model  we significantly changed our business operations  sales and implementation practices  customer service and support operations and management focus 
we also face new risks and challenges  including a lack of meaningful historical financial data upon which to plan future budgets  the need to develop strategic relationships and other risks described below 

table of contents our business will be harmed if we cannot maintain our strategic alliance agreement and the cross license agreement with idx or if we are unable to enter into and maintain relationships with idx customers 
in  we entered into a year strategic alliance agreement with idx pursuant to which allscripts and idx agreed to coordinate product development and align our respective marketing processes 
under this agreement  idx granted us the exclusive right to market  sell  license and distribute ambulatory point of care and clinical application products to idx customers 
this agreement does not  however  limit idx s continued development and distribution of its own lastword n k a carecast or radiology products and services 
our business strategy includes targeting current and prospective idx customers and their affiliates 
if we fail to successfully implement that business strategy  we may not be able to achieve projected results 
if the strategic alliance agreement were terminated  our services might not be as attractive to idx customers and we may not have access to this important customer base 
in such an event  idx might enter into arrangements that would allow our competitors to utilize idx technology and idx could compete against us  and we may not be able to align with another company to market and distribute our products on as favorable a basis as that represented by the idx strategic alliance 
if any of these situations were to occur  our expected revenues may be lower  and our business may be harmed 
in addition  prior to the termination of this agreement  we cannot allow certain specified idx direct competitors to market  distribute or sell our services  even if that agreement would benefit our business 
we also have a cross license and software maintenance agreement with idx pursuant to which we granted idx a license to use  market and sublicense our products combined with idx products  and idx granted us a license to use  market and sublicense idx software for use with our products 
if this agreement is terminated  we will not have access to certain idx software  harming our ability to integrate our services with idx systems and provide real time data synchronization 
this would make our systems less desirable to idx customers and would harm our business 
our business will not be successful unless we establish and maintain additional strategic relationships 
to be successful  we must establish and maintain strategic relationships with leaders in a number of healthcare and internet industry segments 
this is critical to our success because we believe that these relationships will enable us to extend the reach of our products and services to a larger number of physicians and to other participants in the healthcare industry  develop and deploy new products  further enhance the allscripts brand  and generate additional revenue and cash flows entering into strategic relationships is complicated because some of our current and future strategic partners may decide to compete with us in some or all of our markets 
in addition  we may not be able to establish relationships with key participants in the healthcare industry if we have relationships with their competitors 
moreover  many potential strategic partners have resisted  and may continue to resist  working with us until our products and services have achieved widespread market acceptance 
once we have established strategic relationships  we will depend on our partners ability to generate increased acceptance and use of our products and services 
to date  we have established only a limited number of strategic relationships  and many of these relationships are in the early stages of development and may not achieve the objectives that we seek 
we have limited experience in establishing and maintaining strategic relationships with healthcare and internet industry participants 
if we lose any of these strategic relationships or fail to establish additional relationships  or if our strategic relationships fail to benefit us as expected  we may not be able to execute our business plan  and our business will suffer 

table of contents if we are unable to successfully integrate the rxcentric and aic acquisitions or otherwise implement our acquisition strategy  our ability to expand our product and service offerings and our customer base may be limited 
the successful integration of acquired businesses is critical to our success 
prior to our acquisition of aic  we maintained a strategic partnership with aic  allowing us to offer digital imaging functionality to clients through the touchworks scan module 
the acquisition of aic is intended to further increase our sales capacity in both our touchworks and physicians interactive business units  expand our product offering  and gain a number of new client relationships 
similarly  the acquisition of certain assets and assumed liabilities of rxcentric is intended to improve our ability to recruit physicians to participate in interactive education programs  leverage rxcentric s technologies to complement our portfolio of solutions  and enhance domestic and emerging international market operations for our physicians interactive business unit 
such acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company and our inability to maintain the goodwill of the acquired businesses 
if we fail to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or fail to implement our business strategies with respect to these acquisitions  we may not be able to achieve projected results or support the amount of consideration paid for aic and rxcentric 
in order to expand our product and service offerings and grow our business by reaching new customers  we may continue to acquire businesses that we believe are complementary 
the successful implementation of this strategy depends on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  acquire companies on acceptable terms  integrate their operations and technology successfully with our own and maintain the goodwill of the acquired business 
we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed 
moreover  in pursuing acquisition opportunities  we may compete for acquisition targets with other companies with similar growth strategies 
some of these competitors may be larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have 
competition for these acquisition targets could also result in increased prices of acquisition targets 
future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities  the write off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
we have taken  and  if an impairment occurs  could take  charges against earnings in connection with acquisitions 
if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology  our business prospects will be impaired 
the successful implementation of our business model depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and introduce new products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce new products on schedule  or at all 
in addition  early releases of software often contain errors or defects 
we cannot assure you that  despite our extensive testing  errors will not be found in our new product releases and services before or after commercial release  which would result in product redevelopment costs and loss of  or delay in  market acceptance 
a failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce these products on schedule could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
if we cannot adapt to changing technologies  our products and services may become obsolete  and our business could suffer 
because the internet and healthcare information markets are characterized by rapid technological change  we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential customers requirements that could make our existing technology obsolete 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and services  develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers  license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
the 
table of contents development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
our future success depends upon our ability to grow  and if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our customers requirements 
we will need to expand our operations if we successfully achieve market acceptance for our products and services 
we cannot be certain that our systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of our operations 
our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical  administrative  financial control and reporting systems 
an unexpectedly large increase in the volume or pace of traffic on our web site or the number of orders placed by customers may require us to expand and further upgrade our technology 
we may not be able to project the rate or timing of increases in the use of our web site accurately or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases 
difficulties in managing any future growth could have a significant negative impact on our business because we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our customers requirements 
if we lose the services of our key personnel  we may be unable to replace them  and our business could be negatively affected 
our success depends in large part on the continued service of our management and other key personnel and our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
in particular  the services of glen e 
tullman  our chairman and chief executive officer  are integral to the execution of our business strategy 
if one or more of our key employees leaves our employment  we will have to find a replacement with the combination of skills and attributes necessary to execute our strategy 
because competition for skilled employees is intense  and the process of finding qualified individuals can be lengthy and expensive  we believe that the loss of the services of key personnel could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on our intellectual property rights  and if we are unable to protect them  our competitive position may suffer 
our business plan is predicated on our proprietary systems and technology  including touchworks  document imaging and scanning solutions  and physician education products 
we protect our proprietary rights through a combination of trademark  trade secret and copyright law  confidentiality agreements and technical measures 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to our trade secrets and technology 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology 
misappropriation of our intellectual property would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
in addition  we may have to engage in litigation in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of invalidity  and we may incur substantial costs as a result 
if we are deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and the functionality of our applications overlaps with competitive products 
while we do not believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any valid proprietary rights of third parties  we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us or that those claims will be unsuccessful 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims 
furthermore  a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or 
table of contents other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services 
in addition  we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
factors beyond our control could cause interruptions in our operations  which would adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace and our results of operations 
to succeed  we must be able to operate our systems without interruption 
certain of our communications and information services are provided through our service providers 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by damage from a variety of sources  many of which are not within our control  including without limitation i power loss and telecommunications failures  ii software and hardware errors  failures or crashes  iii computer viruses and similar disruptive problems  and iv fire  flood and other natural disasters 
any significant interruptions in our services would damage our reputation in the marketplace and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we may be liable for use of data we provide 
we provide data for use by healthcare providers in treating patients 
third party contractors provide us with most of this data 
while we maintain product liability insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is sufficient for our business  we cannot assure you that this coverage will prove to be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a claim brought against us that is uninsured or under insured could materially harm our financial condition 
if our security is breached  we could be subject to liability  and customers could be deterred from using our services 
the difficulty of securely transmitting confidential information over the internet has been a significant barrier to conducting e commerce and engaging in sensitive communications over the internet 
our strategy relies on the use of the internet to transmit confidential information 
we believe that any well publicized compromise of internet security may deter people from using the internet for these purposes  and from using our system to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential healthcare information 
it is also possible that third parties could penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate patient information and other data 
if this happens  our operations could be interrupted  and we could be subject to liability 
we may have to devote significant financial and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
we could face financial loss  litigation and other liabilities to the extent that our activities or the activities of third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of confidential information like patient records or credit information 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing for our future needs  our growth prospects and our ability to respond to competitive pressures may be impaired 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of potential acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  or respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
if our content and service providers fail to perform adequately  our reputation in the marketplace and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we depend on independent content and service providers for many of the benefits we provide through our touchworks system and our physician education applications and services  including the maintenance of 
table of contents managed care pharmacy guidelines  drug interaction reviews and the routing of transaction data to third party payers 
any problems with our providers that result in interruptions of our services or a failure of our services to function as desired could damage our reputation in the marketplace and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may have no means of replacing content or services on a timely basis or at all if they are inadequate or in the event of a service interruption or failure 
we also expect to rely on independent content providers for the majority of the clinical  educational and other healthcare information that we plan to provide 
in addition  we will depend on our content providers to deliver high quality content from reliable sources and to continually upgrade their content in response to demand and evolving healthcare industry trends 
any failure by these parties to develop and maintain high quality  attractive content could impair the value of our brand and our results of operations 
if we are forced to reduce our prices  our results of operations could suffer 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales  including sales over the internet  of prepackaged medications to physicians 
we may be subject to pricing pressures with respect to our future sales of prepackaged medications arising from various sources  including practices of managed care organizations  internet pharmacies  including those operating in canada and other countries foreign to the united states  and government action affecting pharmaceutical reimbursement under medicare 
our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship are affected by changes in regulations and limitations in governmental spending for medicare and medicaid programs 
recent actions by congress could limit government spending for the medicare and medicaid programs  limit payments to hospitals and other providers  and increase emphasis on competition and other programs that potentially could have an adverse effect on our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship 
if our pricing of prepackaged medications experiences significant downward pressure  our business will be less profitable 
if we are unable to maintain existing relationships and create new relationships with managed care payers  our prospects for growth may suffer 
we rely on managed care organizations to reimburse our physician customers for prescription medications dispensed in their offices 
while many of the leading managed care payers and pharmacy benefit managers currently reimburse our physicians for in office dispensing  none of these payers are under a long term obligation to do so 
if we are unable to increase the number of managed care payers that reimburse for in office dispensing  or if some or all of the payers who currently reimburse physicians decline to do so in the future  utilization of our products and  therefore  our growth will be impaired 
if we incur costs exceeding our insurance coverage in lawsuits pending against us or that are brought against us in the future  it could materially adversely affect our financial condition 
we are a defendant in numerous multi defendant lawsuits involving the manufacture and sale of dexfenfluramine  fenfluramine and phentermine 
in the event we are found liable in any lawsuits filed against us  and if our insurance coverage were inadequate to satisfy these liabilities  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
see legal proceedings 
if our principal supplier fails or is unable to perform its contract with us  we may be unable to meet our commitments to our customers 
we currently purchase a majority of the medications that we repackage from amerisourcebergen 
if we do not meet certain minimum purchasing requirements  amerisourcebergen may increase the prices that we pay under this agreement  in which case we would have the option to terminate the agreement 
although we believe that there are a number of other sources of supply of medications  if amerisourcebergen fails or is unable to perform under our agreement  particularly at certain critical times during the year  we may be unable to meet our commitments to our customers  and our relationships with our customers could suffer 

table of contents because of anti takeover provisions under delaware law and in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  takeovers may be more difficult  possibly preventing you from obtaining optimal share price 
certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
for example  our certificate of incorporation and by laws provide for a classified board of directors and allow us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 
risks related to our industry if the healthcare environment becomes more restrictive  or if we do not comply with healthcare regulations  our existing and future operations may be curtailed  and we could be subject to liability 
as a participant in the healthcare industry  our operations and relationships are regulated by a number of federal  state and local governmental entities 
because our business relationships with physicians are unique  and the healthcare electronic commerce industry as a whole is relatively young  the application of many state and federal regulations to our business operations is uncertain 
it is possible that a review of our business practices or those of our customers by courts or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that could adversely affect us 
in addition  the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth 
this industry is expected to continue to undergo significant changes for the foreseeable future  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
future regulation of our business practices or those of our customers may adversely affect us 
recent government and industry legislation and rulemaking  especially the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  and industry groups such as the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations jcaho  require the use of standard transactions  standard identifiers  security and other standards and requirements for the transmission of certain electronic health information 
new national standards and procedures under hipaa include the standards for electronic transactions and code sets the transaction standards  the security standards the security standards  and standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information the privacy standards 
the transaction standards require the use of specified data coding  formatting and content in all specified health care transactions conducted electronically 
the security standards require the adoption of specified types of security for health care information 
the privacy standards grant a number of rights to individuals as to their identifiable confidential medical information called protected health information and restrict the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities 
generally  the hipaa standards directly affect covered entities  defined as health care providers  health care payers  and health care clearinghouses 
in addition  the privacy standards affect third parties that create or access protected health information in order to perform a function or activity on behalf of a covered entity 
such third parties are called business associates 
covered entities must have a written business associate agreement with such third parties  containing specified satisfactory assurances that the third party will safeguard protected health information that it creates or accesses and will fulfill other material obligations to support the covered entity s own hipaa compliance 
most of our customers are covered entities 
additionally  covered entities will be required to adopt a unique standard national provider identifier npi  for use in filing and processing health care claims and other transactions 
we believe that the principal effects of hipaa are  or will be  first  to require that our systems be capable of being operated by our customers in a manner that is compliant with the various hipaa standards and  second  to require us to enter into and comply with business associate agreements with our covered entity customers 
for most covered entities  the deadlines for compliance with the privacy standards and the transaction standards occurred in covered entities must be in compliance with the security standards by april   and must use npis in standard transactions no later than the compliance dates  which are may   for all but small health plans and one 
table of contents year later for small health plans 
we believe that our systems and products are capable of being used by our customers in compliance with the transaction standards and are  or will be  capable of being used by our customers in compliance with the security standards and the npi requirements 
however  because all hipaa standards are subject to change or interpretation and because certain other hipaa standards  not discussed above  are not yet published  we cannot predict the future impact of hipaa on our business and operations 
additionally  certain state laws are not pre empted by the hipaa standards and may impose independent obligations upon our customers or us 
specific risks include  but are not limited to  risks relating to electronic prescribing 
the use of our software by physicians to perform a variety of functions  including electronic prescribing  electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies and dispensing  is governed by state and federal law 
states have differing prescription format requirements  which we have programmed into our software 
many existing laws and regulations  when enacted  did not anticipate methods of e commerce now being developed 
while federal law and the laws of many states permit the electronic transmission of prescription orders  the laws of several states neither specifically permit nor specifically prohibit the practice 
given the rapid growth of e commerce in healthcare  and particularly the growth of the internet  we expect the remaining states to directly address these areas with regulation in the near future 
it is possible that aspects of our touchworks software tools could become subject to government regulation 
compliance with these regulations could be burdensome  time consuming and expensive 
we also could become subject to future legislation and regulations concerning the development and marketing of healthcare software systems 
these could increase the cost and time necessary to market new services and could affect us in other respects not presently foreseeable 
we cannot predict the effect of possible future legislation and regulation 
claims transmission 
as part of our services provided to physicians  our system will electronically transmit claims for prescription medications dispensed by a physician to many patients payers for immediate approval and reimbursement 
federal law provides that it is both a civil and a criminal violation for any person to submit a claim to any payer  including  for example  medicare  medicaid and all private health plans and managed care plans  seeking payment for any services or products that over bills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient 
we have in place policies and procedures that we believe assure that all claims that are transmitted by our system are accurate and complete  provided that the information given to us by our customer is also accurate and complete 
if  however  we do not follow those procedures and policies  or they are not sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims from being submitted  we could be subject to liability 
the hipaa transaction standards and the hipaa security standards will also have a potentially significant effect on our claims transmission services  since those services must be structured and provided in a way that supports our customers hipaa compliance obligations 
patient information 
as part of the operation of our business  our customers provide to us patient identifiable medical information related to the prescription drugs that they prescribe and other aspects of patient treatment 
we have policies and procedures that we believe assure compliance with all federal and state confidentiality requirements for handling of protected health information that we receive and with our obligations under business associate agreements 
if  however  we do not follow those procedures and policies  or they are not sufficient to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential medical information  we could be subject to liability  fines and lawsuits  termination of our customer contracts  or our operations could be shut down 
additionally  in the event that the privacy standards and other hipaa compliance requirements change or are interpreted in a way that requires material change to the way in which we do business  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and prospects 
additional legislation governing the dissemination of medical record information has been proposed at both the state and federal level 
such legislation may require holders of such information to implement additional security measures that may require substantial expenditures 
there can be no assurance that changes to state or federal laws will not materially restrict the ability of providers to submit information from patient records using our products and services 

table of contents medical devices 
the united states food and drug administration has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the medical device amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
to the extent that computer software is a medical device under the policy  we  as a manufacturer of such products  could be required  depending on the product  to register and list our products with the fda  notify the fda and demonstrate substantial equivalence to other products on the market before marketing such products  or obtain fda approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing a product 
depending on the intended use of a device  the fda could require us to obtain extensive data from clinical studies to demonstrate safety or effectiveness  or substantial equivalence 
if the fda requires this data  we would be required to obtain approval of an investigational device exemption before undertaking clinical trials 
clinical trials can take extended periods of time to complete 
we cannot provide assurances that the fda will approve or clear a device after the completion of such trials 
in addition  these products would be subject to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act s general controls  including those relating to good manufacturing practices and adverse experience reporting 
although it is not possible to anticipate the final form of the fda s policy with regard to computer software  we expect that the fda is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in healthcare settings regardless of whether the draft is finalized or changed 
the fda can impose extensive requirements governing pre and post market conditions like service investigation  approval  labeling and manufacturing 
in addition  the fda can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes 
edetailing 
our pharmaceutical and medical device clients use pi edetailing programs to provide physicians with valuable and up to date information about various medications and medical products  as well as to collect feedback from physician opinion leaders and other experts 
pharmaceutical marketing activities are subject to various regulatory and compliance initiatives  including a new industry sponsored ethics initiative developed by the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma code and the final compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers issued on april   by the hhs office of inspector general oig 
such initiatives articulate concerns  recommendations and standards concerning a variety of pharama marketing activities and issues  including kickback concerns  discounts  switching arrangements  research consulting advisory payments  and gifts entertainment other remuneration  among others 
additionally  as a sender of electronic mail in connection with some of our educational programs  we are subject to the can spam act of we believe that our programs and activities comply with applicable laws and regulations  and are consistent with phrma code and oig recommendations and standards 
however  if our physician educational programs were found to be conducted in a manner inconsistent with such laws  regulations or initiatives  or if we are required to materially change to the way in which we do business in order in order to conform with such laws  regulations and initiatives  our business  results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected 
licensure and physician dispensing 
as a repackager and distributor of drugs  we are subject to regulation by and licensure with the food and drug administration fda  the drug enforcement agency dea and various state agencies that regulate wholesalers or distributors 
among the regulations applicable to our repackaging operation are the fda s good manufacturing practices 
we are subject to periodic inspections of our facilities by regulatory authorities  and adherence to policies and procedures for compliance with applicable legal requirements 
because the fda s good manufacturing practices were designed to govern the manufacture  rather than the repackaging  of drugs  we face legal uncertainty concerning the application of some aspects of these regulations and of the standards that the fda will enforce 
if we do not maintain all necessary licenses  or the fda decides to 
table of contents substantially modify the manner in which it has historically enforced its good manufacturing practice regulations against drug repackagers or the fda or dea finds any violations during one of their periodic inspections  we could be subject to liability  and our operations could be shut down 
while physician dispensing of medications for profit is allowed in most states  as highlighted above  it is possible that certain states may enact legislation or regulations prohibiting  restricting or further regulating physician dispensing 
similarly  while a july opinion the american medical association s council on ethical and judicial affairs ceja provides in relevant part that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices provided such dispensing primarily benefits the patient  the ama has historically taken inconsistent positions on physician dispensing and past reports of the ceja have opposed the in office sale of health related products by physicians  and it is possible that the ceja may in the future oppose the in office sale of health related products by physicians 
any such state legislative prohibitions or ceja opposition of physician dispensing could adversely affect us 
congress enacted significant prohibitions against physician self referrals in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of this law  commonly referred to as stark ii  applies to physician dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs that are reimbursable by medicare or medicaid 
stark ii  however  includes an exception for the provision of in office ancillary services  including a physician s dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs  provided that the physician meets the requirements of the exception 
we believe that the physicians who use our system or dispense drugs distributed by us are aware of these requirements  since they are generally well known in the health care industry  but we do not monitor their compliance and have no assurance that our customers are in material compliance with stark ii  either pursuant to the in office ancillary services exception or another applicable exception 
if it were determined that the physicians who use our system or dispense pharmaceuticals purchased from us were not in compliance with stark ii  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and prospects 
as a distributor of prescription drugs to physicians  we are subject to the federal anti kickback statute  which applies to medicare  medicaid and other state and federal programs 
the statute prohibits the solicitation  offer  payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referrals or the purchase  or in return for recommending or arranging for the referral or purchase  of goods  including drugs  covered by the programs 
the anti kickback law provides a number of exceptions or safe harbors for particular types of transactions 
we believe that our arrangements with our customers are in material compliance with the anti kickback statute and relevant safe harbors 
many states have similar fraud and abuse laws  and we believe that we are in material compliance with those laws 
if  however  it were determined that we  as a distributor of prescription drugs to physicians  were not in compliance with the federal anti kickback statute  we could be subject to liability  and our operations could be curtailed 
moreover  if the activities of our customers or other entity with which we have a business relationship were found to constitute a violation of the federal anti kickback law and we  as a result of the provision of products or services to such customer or entity  were found to have knowingly participated in such activities  we could be subject to sanction or liability under such laws  including our exclusion from government health programs 
as a result of exclusion from government health programs  our customers would not be permitted to make any payments to us 
increased government involvement in healthcare could adversely affect our business 
us healthcare system reform under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  and other initiatives at both the federal and state level  could increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the business environment of our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship 
while no federal price controls are included in the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act  any legislation that reduces physician incentives to dispense medications in their offices could adversely affect physician acceptance of our products 
we cannot predict whether or when future health care reform initiatives at the federal or state level or other initiatives affecting our business will be proposed  enacted or implemented or what impact those initiatives may 
table of contents have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship could react to these initiatives and the uncertainty surrounding these proposals by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for our products and services 
additionally  government regulation could alter the clinical workflow of physicians and other healthcare participants  thereby limiting the utility of our products and services to existing and potential customers and curtailing broad acceptance our products and services 
if the rapidly evolving electronic healthcare information market fails to develop as quickly as expected  our business prospects will be impaired 
the electronic healthcare information market is in the early stages of development and is rapidly evolving 
a number of market entrants have introduced or developed products and services that are competitive with one or more components of the solutions we offer 
we expect that additional companies will continue to enter this market 
in new and rapidly evolving industries  there is significant uncertainty and risk as to the demand for  and market acceptance of  recently introduced products and services 
because the markets for our products and services are new and evolving  we are not able to predict the size and growth rate of the markets with any certainty 
we cannot assure you that markets for our products and services will develop or that  if they do  they will be strong and continue to grow at a sufficient pace 
if markets fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become saturated with competitors  our business prospects will be impaired 
consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
many healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
as provider networks and managed care organizations consolidate  competition to provide products and services like ours will become more intense  and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants will become greater 
these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
if we were forced to reduce our prices  our business would become less profitable unless we were able to achieve corresponding reductions in our expenses 
risks related to our stock the public market for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors  including actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new services or products by our competitors or us  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions and trends in the electronic healthcare information  internet  e commerce and pharmaceutical markets  and general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock markets  especially the nasdaq national market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies  and internet related companies in particular 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 
these broad market factors may materially affect the trading price of our common stock 
general economic  political and market conditions like recessions and interest rate fluctuations may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
volatility in the market price for our common stock may result in the filing of securities class action litigation 

table of contents our quarterly operating results may vary 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past  and we expect that our quarterly operating results will continue to vary in future periods depending on a number of factors  including seasonal variances in demand for our products and services  the sales  service and implementation cycles for our touchworks system  document imaging and scanning solutions  and physician education products and services and other factors described in this risk factors section of this report 
for example  all other factors aside  sales of our prepackaged medications have historically been highest in the fall and winter months 
we base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue  and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we have lower revenue  we may not be able to reduce our spending in the short term in response 
any shortfall in revenue would have a direct impact on our results of operations 
for these and other reasons  we may not meet the earnings estimates of securities analysts or investors  and our stock price could suffer 
safe harbor for forward looking statements this report and statements we make or our representatives make contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed above and elsewhere in this report 
we develop forward looking statements by combining currently available information with our beliefs and assumptions 
these statements relate to future events  including our future performance  and often contain words like believe  expect  anticipate  intend  contemplate  seek  plan  estimate or similar expressions 
forward looking statements do not guarantee future performance  which may be materially different from that expressed in  or implied by  any such statements 
recognize these statements for what they are and do not rely upon them as facts 
we make these statements under the protection afforded them by section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
because we cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties that may affect us  or control the ones we do predict  these risks and uncertainties can cause our results to differ materially from the results we express in our forward looking statements
