we derive substantially all of our fee revenues from the performance of professional services 
we recognize revenue earned under time and materials contracts as services are provided based upon hours worked and agreed upon hourly rates 
we recognize revenue earned under fixed price contracts  such as consulting arrangements  using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimates of total expected project costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date 
with the commencement of the economic recovery in the second half of  demand for our services improved resulting in a increase in fee revenues as compared to the improvement in fee revenues combined with continued control of our cost structure resulted in our first profitable year since our initial public offering in  as we reported net income of million  or per share  on a diluted basis 
as part of our net income  we recorded restructuring income of million  or per diluted share  related to the reversal of restructuring expenses for the consolidation of facilities and abandonment of leasehold improvements previously recorded in and with an expectation of a continued economic recovery in  we believe our fee revenues will grow by approximately to generating earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of to per diluted share 
we fund our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
in  operations generated cash totaling million and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options generated million 
these amounts were offset primarily by million of capital expenditures and the repurchase of million shares of common stock at a price per share of  totaling million  including million of transaction costs 
our credit facility allows us to borrow up to million less any amounts committed under outstanding standby letters of credit 
we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants as of december  the credit facility expires in february at december   we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and approximately million outstanding under standby letters of credit  leaving approximately million available for future borrowings 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review and update these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  stock based compensation and restructuring  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our fee revenues from the performance of professional services 
individual projects generally last up to six months  however some of our projects may last longer in duration 
while we 
table of contents generally enter into written agreements with our clients  these contracts are typically terminable upon to days notice 
under these termination provisions  we would earn revenue based upon time and materials incurred 
we recognize revenue earned under time and materials contracts as services are provided based upon hours worked and agreed upon hourly rates 
we recognize revenue earned under fixed price contracts  such as consulting arrangements  using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimates of total expected project costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date 
project costs are based on the direct salary and associated fringe benefits of the consultants on the engagement plus all direct expenses incurred to complete the engagement that are not reimbursed by the client 
we use the proportional performance method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
these estimates are based on historical experience and deliverables identified in the contract and are indicative of the level of benefit provided to our clients 
our financial management maintains contact with project managers to monitor the status of the projects and  for fixed price engagements  financial management is updated on the budgeted costs and required resources to complete the project 
these budgets are then used to calculate revenue recognition and to estimate the income or loss on the project 
favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue and profit recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and profit 
if a contract was anticipated to result in a loss  provisions for the estimated loss on the contract would be made in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
some of our contracts contain provisions for performance incentives 
such contingent revenue is recognized in the period in which the contingency is resolved 
we recognize revenue for services only in those situations where collection from the client is reasonably assured 
our normal payment terms are days from invoice date 
our client relationship managers and finance personnel monitor timely payments from our clients and assess collection issues  if any 
unbilled accounts receivable on contracts is comprised of costs incurred plus estimated earnings from revenue earned in advance of billings under the contract 
we record advance payments as billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts until the services are provided 
included in accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable are reimbursable costs 
we incur significant reimbursable costs on behalf of our clients 
these include payments to vendors for media and production services and postage and travel related expenses 
in accordance with our client agreements  we do not charge a markup on reimbursable costs and we require the client s approval prior to us incurring them 
although we actively mitigate our credit risk related to these pass through expenses and our customers participate in the management of vendor relationships  we are often the sole party that contracts with these vendors 
effective january   upon adoption of the emerging issues task force eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  we reported reimbursements received for pass through costs incurred as a component of revenue in the statement of operations 
reimbursements for periods prior to were reclassified to comply with the guidance in issue allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of clients to make required payments 
we continually assess the collectibility of outstanding customer invoices 
in estimating the allowance  we consider factors that include historical collections  a client s current credit worthiness  age of the receivable balance both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a client s ability to pay 
actual collections could differ from our estimates  requiring additional adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and ceased amortizing goodwill as of that date 
sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual 
table of contents basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and to write down goodwill when impaired 
these events or circumstances generally would include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the asset 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using the two step process as prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate impairment 
otherwise  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date 
we performed the initial step by comparing our fair market value as determined by our publicly traded stock to our carrying amount 
we also considered future discounted cash flows as compared to the carrying amount to assess the recoverability of the goodwill asset 
based upon these tests  we determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying amount resulting in no impairment 
if impairment had occurred  any excess of carrying value over fair value would have been recorded as a loss 
stock based compensation we apply the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board opinion apbo no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our employee stock based compensation plans 
we provide pro forma disclosures of compensation expense under the fair value method of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
see our discussion of stock based compensation in note to the financial statements for the pro forma effect on our net income and income per share had stock based compensation been determined using the fair value method  as well as for the assumptions we used in calculating the fair value of options 
restructuring as part of our restructuring costs  we provide for the estimated costs of the net lease expense for office space that is no longer being utilized 
the provision is equal to the future minimum lease payments under our contractual obligations offset by estimated future sublease income 
in determining these estimates  we evaluated the timing and our potential to sublease our excess space and our ability to renegotiate various leases at more favorable terms 
these sublease estimates  that were made in consultation with our real estate advisers  were based on current and projected conditions at that time in the real estate and economic markets in which we have excess office space 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than those we project  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with our excess office space

table of contents fee revenue 
historically  we have offered our services to clients primarily on a time and materials basis

these contracts generally include estimates on total fees that clients will be charged for the year 
additionally  some of our contracts include a discretionary bonus provision whereby we earn additional compensation based on our performance as evaluated by our clients 
we are typically informed of bonus revenue in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year 
most of our contracts allow us to invoice our clients on a percentage of work completed basis for our services 
we attempt to limit our credit risk by securing clients with significant assets or liquidity 
while we generally enter into written agreements with our clients  these contracts are typically terminable upon to days notice 
in  our top three clients  general motors  american express and at t accounted for approximately of our total fee revenue

restructuring expenses include 
table of contents severance related to workforce reductions and related expenses and the costs for consolidation of facilities 
costs for the consolidation of facilities are comprised of future obligations under the terms of the leases for identified excess space and asset impairment charges for fixed assets related to these spaces  less anticipated income from subleasing activities 
estimates and assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis to reflect new developments and prevailing economic conditions 
if actual conditions are more or less favorable than those we project  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with our excess office space 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary 
as noted above  we began to see an increase in demand for our services in as fee revenue increased from million in to million in an improving economic outlook combined with the completion of the war in iraq resulted in our clients elevating their levels of spending with us over the last six months of the year 
professional services cost and selling  general and administrative expense remained relatively consistent with levels as we maintained tight control over hiring and discretionary spending 
our cost control measures combined with marginal revenue growth resulted in our first year of profitability since our initial public offering in  as we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss for of million  or per share 
additionally  we recorded restructuring income of million  or per diluted share  related to the reversal of restructuring expense for the consolidation of facilities and abandonment of leasehold improvements previously recorded in and revenue 
total revenue for decreased by million  or  to million from million in fee revenue for increased by million  or  to million from million in the increase in fee revenue is due to an increase in demand for our services and higher bonus revenue 
the decrease in total revenue is due to a decrease in pass through revenue partially offset by the increase in fee revenue 
pass through revenue for decreased by million  or  to million from million in due to the timing of client marketing campaigns and some clients assuming responsibility for directly paying third party vendors for marketing campaign expenses 
professional services costs 
professional services costs for increased by million  or  to million from million in professional services costs represented of fee revenue for both and the increase in cost was the result of adding headcount to meet the increased demand for our services in the second half of we added the equivalent of approximately full time employees  representing approximately an increase in total headcount  in the second half of to meet client demand in the second half of we expect that professional service costs will increase in as we increase our hiring to meet expected levels of demand 
however  professional service costs as a percent of fee revenue should remain consistent with the prior year  at of fee revenue  or improve slightly as we achieve higher levels of utilization from our existing resources 
pass through expenses 
pass through expenses are reimbursable costs incurred by digitas on behalf of our clients 
pass through expenses include payments to vendors for media and production services and postage and travel related expenses 
pass through expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million in due to the timing of marketing campaigns and some clients assuming responsibility for directly paying third party vendors for marketing campaign expenses 
pass through expenses are offset by pass through revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased by million  or  to million from million for as a percentage of fee revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in the dollar decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of a decrease in depreciation expense of million resulting from older assets becoming fully depreciated and the write off of abandoned leasehold improvements related to restructuring activities 
the reduction in depreciation expense was primarily offset by increased recruiting placement and relocation costs of million  incurred in the second half of  from 
table of contents the hiring of additional headcount to meet expected levels of demand in the percentage decrease is a result of a decrease in total selling  general and administrative expense combined with the increase in fee revenue 
we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of fee revenue will continue to decrease in as a result of controlled levels of discretionary spending combined with expectations for increased fee revenues 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  consisting of non cash compensation  was million for compared to million for the decrease is due to the cancellation of stock options prior to their vesting dates in connection with attrition 
we have not granted or repurchased any options or issued common stock at a price below the estimated fair market value subsequent to the initial public offering in march we expect that all remaining deferred compensation will be fully expensed during restructuring expenses income  net 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring income of million as we reversed restructuring expenses related to the consolidation of facilities and abandonment of leasehold improvements that we previously recorded in and in  we recorded restructuring expenses totaling million 
during  we recorded restructuring expenses totaling million  consisting of million for workforce reduction and related costs and million for the consolidation of facilities and abandonment of related leasehold improvements 
we recorded these charges to further align our cost structure with changing market conditions and to update estimates originally made in to reflect current information 
we determined that we would be unable to dispose of our excess office space in boston  new york and san francisco within our original assumptions 
as a result  we recorded restructuring expenses of million to reflect the revised estimate of our expected future obligations under the terms of those leases  less anticipated income from subleasing activities 
the change in estimate was related to changes in estimated future sublease rates and terms 
these sublease estimates  which were made in consultation with our real estate advisers  were based on current and projected conditions at the time in the real estate and economic markets in which we determined we had excess office space 
in addition  we recorded restructuring expenses of million for costs related to the closure of our miami and salt lake city facilities 
during  we made significant progress towards eliminating our excess real estate resulting in the recognition of million of restructuring income related to the reversal of restructuring expense initially recorded in and the restructuring expense was reversed because of savings of million as compared to our original estimates 
these savings were the result of subleasing our excess space at terms more favorable than estimates and assumptions made in  for savings of million  negotiating a termination of the salt lake city lease for less than our estimates  for savings of million and returning one floor initially restructured in san francisco to operations  which represented savings of million 
the million in savings was offset by revisions in estimates of future sublease rates and terms for remaining leases resulting in an increase in expected future obligations of million 
we continue to evaluate alternatives and monitor our restructuring accrual on a quarterly basis to reflect new developments and prevailing economic conditions in the real estate markets in which we lease office space 
these sublease estimates  which were made in consultation with our real estate advisers  were based on current and projected conditions at the time in the real estate and economic markets in which we determined we had excess office space 
at december   approximately  square feet of the approximately  square feet initially identified as excess remained available for sublease 
the floor returned to operations in san francisco was restructured in the third quarter of because we had committed to a plan to redeploy  reorganize and streamline the workforce in san francisco and relocate in to a more efficient and cost effective office location 
at the time of the restructuring charge  the floor was being used in operations 
all costs associated with this floor including rent expense  operating expenses and depreciation expense on leasehold improvements continued to be included as part of selling  general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations  with an expectation that all costs would continue to be 
table of contents included as part of selling  general and administrative expenses until the plan to vacate the space was implemented 
the initial plan communicated to the workforce was scheduled to be implemented in january  but was subsequently postponed due to some incremental projects won in december and january many of the changes in workforce were implemented over the first two quarters of as the skill sets of those identified were not required to serve the new projects 
although the initial plan to vacate the facility was postponed  we continued to expect that in the floor would be vacated and the employees in the region would be relocated to more efficient and cost effective space 
although we allowed in our restructuring plan for a significant vacancy period due to the poor real estate market in san francisco  we actively marketed the floor throughout with the intent of securing a subtenant to minimize the cash flow drain to us for paying rent on the new location while the old location remained vacant 
however  in the fourth quarter of it became apparent that the original plan to vacate the floor was not likely to be carried out  as originally developed by us and approved by the board of directors  and that the floor should continue to be used in operations 
this decision was made because certain client relationships expanded at a pace exceeding our initial budget estimates and expectations  improved business expectations with additional clients previously thought to be declining relationships  the hiring in december of a new president for the san francisco office and continued poor market conditions for real estate in san francisco  which would likely result in the floor remaining vacant for a lengthy period of time 
at december   our restructuring accrual totaled million 
approximately million of that amount is workforce related for final payments of severance and will be fully utilized in the remaining million is related to remaining real estate obligations net of sublease income 
we believe the restructuring accrual of million is appropriate and adequate to cover these remaining obligations

risks factors and important factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that could harm our business prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
you should carefully read the following risk factors  together with the financial statements  related notes and other information contained in this form k 
this form k contains forward looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties 
please refer to the discussion of forward looking statements on page three in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below 
risks related to our business the loss of even one significant client or any significant reduction in the use of our services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations we derive a significant portion of our revenues from large scale engagements with a limited number of clients 
most of these relationships  including those with our three largest clients  are terminable by the client without penalty on to days prior written notice 
for  our three largest clients  general motors  american express and at t  collectively accounted for approximately of our fee revenue  and our largest client  general motors  accounted for approximately of fee revenue 
the loss of any major client or any significant reduction in the use of our services by a major client could materially reduce our revenue and have a negative impact on our operating results  financial condition and reputation in our market 
our top ten clients accounted for approximately of our fee revenue 

table of contents our failure to meet our clients expectations could result in losses or negative publicity and could subject us to liability for the services we provide as clients have dedicated more money and resources to our engagements with them  their expectations have also increased 
as our client engagements become larger and more complex and are required to be completed in a shorter time frame  we face increased management challenges and greater risk of mistakes 
any failure on our part to deliver our services in accordance with our clients expectations could result in additional expenditures to correct the problem  delayed or lost client revenues  adverse client reactions and negative publicity  and claims against us 
although our client agreements often limit our liability to damages arising from our rendering of services  we cannot assure that these provisions will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability 
while we carry general liability insurance coverage  our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
failure to manage our growth may impact our operating results if we succeed in expanding our business  that expansion may place increased demands on our management  operating systems  internal controls and financial and physical resources 
if not managed effectively  these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to our existing clients 
in addition  our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations 
consequently  in order to manage growth effectively  we may be required to increase expenditures to expand  train and manage our employee base  improve our management  financial and information systems and controls  or make other capital expenditures 
our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting  forecasting and other process control issues presented by our growth 
acts of war or terrorism  or related effects could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition an act of war or terrorism could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the related effects of an act of war or terrorism  such as disruptions in air transportation  enhanced security measures and political instability in certain foreign countries may interrupt our business and that of our clients 
an act of war or terrorism may result in a significant reduction in client spending or contribute to an economic downturn and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
an economic recession or downturn in the united states or abroad may result in a reduction in our revenues and operating results our ability to succeed depends on the continued investment of our current and future clients in the services we offer 
our business has been adversely impacted during the last three years by a decline in demand for our services  primarily related to the economic down turn experienced during the first two and a half years of that period 
an economic recession or downturn in the united states and abroad may cause some of our current and future clients to reduce or eliminate their budgets for our services 
furthermore  the reduction in client budgets may intensify competition and further increase pressure for us to reduce the fees we charge our clients 
a lasting economic recession or downturn in the united states or abroad may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents actual and perceived conflicts of interest may restrict us in obtaining new clients actual and perceived conflicts of interest are inherent in our industry 
we sometimes decline to accept potential clients because of actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our existing clients or because a client insists  for whatever reason  that we not work with its competitors 
in addition  potential clients may choose not to retain us for reasons of actual or perceived conflicts of interest 
many of our clients compete in industries where only a limited number of companies gain meaningful market share 
as a result  if we decide not to perform services for a particular client s competitors  or if potential clients choose not to retain us because of actual or perceived conflicts and our client fails to capture a significant portion of its market  we may receive reduced or no future revenue in that particular industry 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results may lead to reduced prices for our stock our quarterly revenues and operating results can be volatile 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
however  if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our securities would likely decline 
factors that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate in the future include the following variability in market demand for our services  length of the sales cycle associated with our service offerings  unanticipated variations in the size  budget  number or progress toward completion of our engagements  unanticipated termination of a major engagement  a client s decision not to proceed with an engagement we anticipated or the completion or delay during a quarter of several major client engagements  our ability to manage our operating costs  a large portion of which are fixed in advance of any particular quarter  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  our ability to manage future growth  timing and amount of client bonus payments  and costs of attracting and training skilled personnel 
some of these factors are within our control while others are outside of our control 
if we are not successful in expanding our ability to service our clients on a worldwide basis  we may jeopardize our relationships with existing clients and limit our ability to attract new clients failure to meet client demands that their relationship marketing service providers be able to handle assignments on a worldwide basis may jeopardize our existing client relationships and limit our ability to attract new clients 
currently  we serve european markets from our office in london and can serve markets in other regions from offices in the united states 
to succeed we may also need to deepen and broaden our expertise in dealing with worldwide assignments by expanding our presence outside of the united states or by hiring more senior executives with multi national technology  marketing and customer relationship management expertise  and there is no assurance that we can attract those people or establish on a profitable basis offices outside of the united states 
we have limited experience in marketing  selling and supporting our services outside of north america and the united kingdom  and development of such skills may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate 
operations outside the united states may be unprofitable or less profitable than operations in the united states  
table of contents especially due to language barriers  cultural differences  economic and political conditions in countries outside the united states  currency exchange risks  differences in terms of payment and collectibility of receivables  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  the burden and expense of complying with foreign laws and regulations and the fact that the internet infrastructure in foreign countries may be less advanced than in the united states 
we must maintain our reputation and expand our name recognition to remain competitive we believe that establishing and maintaining name recognition and a good reputation is critical to attracting and expanding our targeted client base as well as attracting and retaining qualified employees 
if our reputation is damaged or if we are unable to establish name recognition  we may become less competitive or lose our market share 
in addition  our name could be associated with any business difficulties of our clients 
as a result  the difficulties or failure of one of our clients could damage our reputation and name and make it difficult for us to compete for new business 
our business will be negatively affected if we do not keep up with rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards and changing client requirements our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and changing client needs 
accordingly  our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to meet these challenges in a timely and cost effective manner 
among the most important challenges facing us is the need to effectively use leading technologies  continue to develop our strategic and technical expertise  influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes  enhance our current service offerings  and develop new services that meet changing customer needs 
our industry is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry  if we cannot effectively compete  our revenue may decline our industry is relatively new and intensely competitive 
we expect competition to intensify even further as our industry evolves 
some of our current competitors have more clients  greater brand or name recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing and public relations resources than we do 
furthermore  there are relatively low barriers to entry into our industry 
as a result  new and unknown market entrants pose a threat to our business 
current or future competitors may also develop or offer services that are comparable or superior to ours at a lower price  which could affect our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish corporate relationships among themselves or other third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with our existing competitors or any new competitors 
potential future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  adversely affect our operating results and dilute shareholder value we may acquire other businesses in the future  which may complicate our management tasks 
we may need to integrate widely dispersed operations with distinct corporate cultures 
our failure to do so could result in our inability to retain the management  key personnel  employees and clients of the acquired business 
such integration efforts also may distract our management from servicing existing clients 
our failure to manage future 
table of contents acquisitions successfully could seriously harm our operating results 
also  acquisition costs could cause our quarterly operating results to vary significantly 
furthermore  our shareholders could be diluted if we finance the acquisitions by issuing equity securities 
we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available to us  and which may dilute the ownership interests of current investors we may need to raise additional funds to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to otherwise support our business and implement our strategy 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to create additional market specific business units  enhance our infrastructure  hire  train and retain employees  keep up with technological advances  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
our failure to do any of these things could restrict our growth  hinder our ability to compete and seriously harm our financial condition 
additionally  if we are able to raise additional funds through equity financings  the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted 
increased government regulation of various direct marketing channels could adversely affect our business state and federal government regulation of various direct marketing channels  such as the internet and telephone  is increasing 
new laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impact us directly or indirectly by preventing our clients from using certain direct marketing methods 
new laws and regulations could create limitations on our clients ability to market to targeted customers which in turn could decrease the demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance 
risks related to the securities markets our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
since we completed our initial public offering in march  the market price for our common stock has been as high as per share and as low as per share 
additionally  the stock market in general  and the market for technology related stocks in particular  has been highly volatile and was characterized by significant decreases in market prices during  and this volatility often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to our perceived prospects  variations in our operating results and our achievement of key business targets  changes in securities analysts recommendations or earnings estimates  differences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts  announcements of new contracts or service offerings by us or our competitors  
table of contents market reaction to any acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors  and general economic or stock market conditions unrelated to our operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
risks related to legal uncertainty we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
if third parties infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks or other proprietary information  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  although we believe that our proprietary rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may assert infringement claims against us or claim that we have violated their intellectual property rights 
such claims  even if not true  could result in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to management 
if any party asserts a claim against us relating to proprietary technology or information  we may need to obtain licenses to the disputed intellectual property 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain any licenses at all 
in addition  protection of intellectual property in many foreign countries is weaker and less reliable than in the united states so  as our business expands into foreign countries  risks associated with protecting our intellectual property will increase 
changes in government regulation of the internet and other emerging technologies could adversely affect our business to date  government regulations have not materially restricted the use of the internet and other emerging technologies by our clients in their markets 
however  the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to such technologies may change 
new state  federal and foreign laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  especially those relating to privacy  could impact us directly or indirectly by preventing our clients from delivering products or services over technology based distribution channels 
failure to comply with applicable government regulations could result in a liability 
any new legislation could inhibit the increased use of the internet and emerging technologies as commercial mediums which in turn would decrease the demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance 
we may become subject to claims regarding foreign laws and regulations that could subject us to increased expenses because we plan to expand our international operations and because many of our current clients have international operations  we may be subject to the laws of foreign jurisdictions 
these laws may change  or new  more restrictive laws may be enacted in the future 
failure to comply with applicable foreign laws and regulations could result in a liability 
international litigation is often expensive and time consuming and could distract our management s attention away from the operation of our business 
provisions of delaware law and of our charter and by laws may make a takeover more difficult provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and in the delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our management and board of directors 
public shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
in our certificate of incorporation we also have a staggered board of directors  which makes it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of the board of directors 
table of contents in any one year 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public shareholders to benefit from a change in control or to change our management and board of directors
