item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes the operations of oakley  inc and its subsidiaries for each of the periods discussed 
overview oakley is an innovation driven designer  manufacturer and distributor of consumer products that include high performance eyewear  footwear  watches  apparel and accessories 
the company s products are sold in the united states through a carefully selected base of accounts which fluctuates between  and  with approximately  to  locations depending on seasonality of summer and winter products 
the store base is comprised of optical stores  sunglass retailers and specialty sports stores  including bike  surf  snow and golf shops  and motorcycle  athletic footwear and sporting goods stores and limited department store distribution 
the company also operates oakley retail stores in the united states that offer a full range of oakley products 
additionally  the company owns iacon  inc  a sunglass retailing chain headquartered in scottsdale  arizona  with sunglass specialty retail stores at december  internationally  the company sells its products in over countries outside the united states  with direct offices in france  germany  united kingdom  italy  japan  mexico  south africa  canada  australia  new zealand and brazil 
in those parts of the world not serviced by the company or its subsidiaries  oakley products are sold through distributors who possess local expertise 
these distributors sell the company s products either exclusively or with complementary products and agree to respect the marketing philosophy and practices of the company 
sales to the company s distributors are denominated in us dollars 
the company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries 
the company and its subsidiaries use foreign exchange contracts in the form of forward contracts to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
significant accounting policies and certain risks and uncertainties the company s historical success is attributable  in part  to its introduction of products which are perceived to represent an improvement in performance over products available in the market 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon its continued ability to develop and introduce such innovative products  although there can be no assurance of the company s ability to do so 
the consumer products industry  including the eyewear  apparel  footwear and watch categories  is fragmented and highly competitive 
in order to retain its market share  the company must continue to be competitive in the areas of quality  technology  method of distribution  style  brand image  intellectual property protection and customer service 
these industries are subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  the company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods 
actual results could significantly differ from such estimates 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most significant accounting policies  which are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results 
revenue recognition the company recognizes wholesale revenue when merchandise is shipped to a customer and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed based on the terms of sale 
revenue from the company s retail store operations is recognized upon purchase by customers at the point of sale 
generally  the company extends credit to its wholesale customers and does not require collateral 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of those customers and historic credit losses have been within management s expectations 
sales agreements with dealers and distributors normally provide general payment terms of to days  depending on the product category 
the company s standard sales agreements with its customers do not provide for any rights of return by the customer other than returns for product warranty related issues 
in addition to these product warranty related returns  the company occasionally accepts other returns at its discretion 
the company records a provision for sales returns and claims based upon historical experience 
actual returns and claims in any future period may differ from the company s estimates 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by the company s review of their current credit information 
the company regularly monitors its customer collections and payments and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the expectations and the provisions established by the company  there can be no assurances that the company will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
the company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the company s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for the company s products can fluctuate significantly 
factors which could affect demand for the company s products include unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors  which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by retailers  continued weakening of economic conditions  which could reduce demand for products sold by the company and which could adversely affect profitability  and future terrorist acts or war  or the threat or escalation thereof  which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending  interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials and  as a result  adversely affect the company s operations and financial performance 
additionally  management s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate  which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
long lived assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
numerous factors  including changes in the company s business  industry segment or the global economy could significantly impact management s decision to retain  dispose of or idle certain of its long lived assets 
goodwill the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates the company s cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
warranties the company provides a one year limited warranty against manufacturer s defects in its eyewear 
all authentic oakley watches are warranted for one year against manufacturer s defects when purchased from an authorized oakley watch dealer 
footwear is warranted for days against manufacturer s defects  and apparel is warranted for days against manufacturer s defects 
the company s standard warranties require the company to repair or replace defective product returned to the company during such warranty period 
the company maintains a reserve for its product warranty liability based on estimates calculated using historical warranty experience 
while warranty costs have historically been within the company s expectations  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs as in the prior years 
a significant increase in product return rates  or a significant increase in the costs to repair product  could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets 
if the company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  the company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the company s judgment 
if the company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
insurance coverage the company is partially self insured for its workers compensation insurance coverage 
under this insurance program  the company is liable for a deductible of  for each individual claim and an aggregate annual liability of  the company records a liability for the estimated cost of claims both reported and incurred but not reported based upon its historical experience 
the estimated costs include the estimated future cost of all open claims 
the company will continue to adjust the estimates as the actual experience dictates 
a significant change in the number or dollar amount of claims could cause the company to revise its estimate of potential losses and affect its reported results 
foreign currency translation the company has direct operations in continental europe  united kingdom  japan  canada  mexico  south africa  australia  new zealand and brazil which collect at future dates in the customers local currencies and purchase finished goods in us dollars 
accordingly  the company is exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency 
assets and liabilities of the company denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
gains and losses on short term intercompany foreign currency transactions are recognized as incurred 
as part of the company s overall strategy to manage its level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the company and its subsidiaries have entered into various foreign exchange contracts in the form of forward contracts 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
vulnerability due to supplier concentrations the company relies on a single source for the supply of several product components  including the uncoated lens blanks from which substantially all of its sunglass lenses are cut 
in the event of the loss of its source for lens blanks  the company has identified an alternate source which may be available 
the effect of the loss of any of these sources including any possible disruption in business will depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find a suitable alternative source and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
there can be no assurance that  if necessary  an additional source of supply for lens blanks or other critical materials can be located or developed in a timely manner 
vulnerability due to customer concentrations net sales to the retail group of luxottica spa luxottica  which include sunglass hut locations worldwide  were approximately  and of the company s net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively

in september  luxottica completed the acquisition of all the shares of australian eyewear retailer opsm group ltd opsm 
opsm operates in the south pacific and southeast asia regions with approximately retail locations  a portion of which currently offer some of the company s products

the decrease in sunglass unit shipments was partially offset by a increase in average selling price primarily as a result of favorable foreign exchange rates and a greater contribution from the company s retail store operations 
the company experienced declines in sales of more mature products  which were partially offset by increased sales from the half jacket  half wire and splice  introduced in  as well as sales of the company s new sunglass styles including the valve  big square wire  monster dog and teaspoon

management believes these sales increases are a result of its expanded product lines  expanded distribution and retail initiatives  including its greater dealer base and increasing consumer acceptance of the company s newer categories 
the company s us net sales  excluding retail store operations  decreased for the year ended december  to million from million in as a result of a decrease in sales to the company s largest us customer  sunglass hut and its affiliates  coupled with a decrease in net sales to the company s broad specialty store account base and other domestic sales 
sales to sunglass hut decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in us net sales reflects the generally depressed retail environment during the first half of  which had a more pronounced effect on the company s mature sunglass category and contributed to the decline in sunglass sales 
additionally  unusual cooler weather conditions during the second quarter of adversely affected the company s summer product sales  particularly sunglasses  sandals  the summer apparel line and the company s prescription sunglasses which led to lower than expected us sales

the company s sales in australia declined on a constant dollar basis in the fourth quarter of and the total year 
these declines were due primarily to disruptions associated with luxottica s acquisition of opsm in australia along with declining market share in the surf distribution channel 
in addition  the company s european sunglass sales were impacted by competitive pressures from strong fashion brands

the decrease in gross profit as a percent of net sales was due to lower sunglass margins due to the decline in sunglass unit volume  partially offset by the positive effects of improved footwear and apparel margins and the positive effect of a weaker us dollar

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
one factor contributing to the growth in net sales was a increase in gross sunglass sales 
gross sunglass sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the growth in gross sunglass sales is composed of a increase in average selling price slightly offset by a decrease in sunglass unit volume 
the increase in average selling price is attributable to the continued shift in product mix to more technical and premium priced items  the weakening of the us dollar  increasing contribution from the company s retail stores and the impact of a retail price increase in north america on most sunglasses in july several factors contributed to the unit decline including soft consumer spending and reduced demand attributable to the weak retail environment  especially in the latter half of the year 
in addition  delayed deliveries of summer sunglass introductions to retailers resulted in fewer inventory turns during the summer selling season and a reduction of the level of reorders during the holiday season 
the delayed deliveries were a result of key raw material shortages caused in part by greater increases in summer demand than originally anticipated 
in addition  sunglass hut s return as a customer negatively impacted demand from the company s other retailers in the fourth quarter  compared to the prior year period when sunglass hut was not purchasing oakley products 
the increase in gross sunglass sales was driven by strong sunglass sales of the company s newer sunglasses such as the half jacket  splice  wire tap  and half wire  introduced in  the switch and e wire  introduced in  and the square wire introduced in  offsetting declines in sales of more mature products 
sales of the company s polarized styles for the year ended december  also contributed to the increase in gross sales with a  or million  increase over the year ended december  gross sales from the company s newer product categories  comprised of footwear  apparel  watches and prescription eyewear  represented of the company s total gross sales for  compared to in sales from these newer product categories increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  apparel gross sales increased to million in  compared with million in prescription eyewear revenue doubled in each of the three years prior to in  prescription eyewear gross sales grew to million in  compared to million in footwear gross sales grew to million in over million in the growth rate for the company s footwear business was more modest when compared to the other newer categories due to reduced orders and limited distribution for the company s fall footwear line 
watch gross sales increased to million in  compared to million in management believes these increases are a result of its expanded product lines  expanded distribution and retail initiatives  including its greater dealer base  and increasing consumer acceptance of the company s newer categories 
the company s total us net sales increased for the year ended december  to million from million in excluding the company s retail store operations  us net sales increased to million in the year ended december  from million in  as a result of a increase in sales to the company s largest us customer  sunglass hut and its affiliates  coupled with a increase in net sales to the company s broad specialty store account base and other domestic sales 
sales to sunglass hut increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  in april  luxottica  one of the company s largest competitors  acquired sunglass hut  and implemented changes which adversely affected the company s net sales to sunglass hut in the latter half of in december  the company and luxottica entered into a new three year commercial agreement for the distribution of oakley products through sunglass hut retail stores which marked the resumption of the business relationship between the two companies

during the year ended december   the company added new iacon stores  bringing the total stores to at december   and eight new oakley stores  bringing the total to retail sales represented of total net sales for during the year ended december   the company s international net sales increased  or million  to million from million during the year ended december  on a constant dollar basis  international sales grew for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  although the company s international sales during the year have been impacted by weak retail environments  especially in europe and japan  all major markets other than latin america experienced growth during the year 
during the second quarter of  international net sales were more adversely affected than us net sales by the sunglass delivery issues discussed above due to the longer lead times required for delivery outside the united states 
in addition  the company s european sunglass sales were impacted by competitive pressures from strong fashion brands 
latin america experienced a large decrease in net sales in the period due to delays in the transition to direct distribution in brazil from the previous independent distributor and overall weak economic conditions in the region 
sales from the company s direct international offices represented of total international sales for  compared to for gross profit gross profit increased to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales reflects higher overall sales discounts  coupled with a lower concentration of sunglass and prescription eyewear products relative to sales of lower gross margin product categories 
iacon sales of sunglass brands other than oakley  as well as the associated occupancy costs  have also had a negative impact on the company s year over year gross margin comparison due to iacon being included for only two months of the comparable period 
foreign exchange had a favorable impact on gross margin relative to the comparable period 
the company s footwear margins were lower in when compared to due to successful efforts to reduce inventory levels of prior season close out products at reduced margins  increased tooling costs per unit and provisions for slow moving inventory 
operating expenses in december  the company announced plans to restructure its european operations with significant changes to the regional sales and distribution organization
