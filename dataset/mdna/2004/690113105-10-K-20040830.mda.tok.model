these on going efforts have increased employee productivity and contributed to the overall reduction of costs 
inventory write offs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal inventory at may  was million  compared to million at may  the million increase includes approximately million for raw materials and approximately million for finished goods 
the increase in finished goods is largely due to the imp contract as well as purchases of finished goods acquired from imp during the first quarter of fiscal the inventory acquired is being credited back to imp at cost after the company provides additional production  overwrapping  and fulfillment services 
this resulted in sales of approximately million during fiscal the company s selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and represented of the company s net sales during fiscal as compared to of net sales in fiscal the decrease in percentage is primarily a result of the significant increase in net sales  while the increase in dollar amount results primarily from increases in bad debt expense  professional services  and subcontract wages

the company is deploying additional resources into marketing strategies in an attempt to increase the company s sales and marketing concentrations 
the company believes that relatively large orders and customers tend to be more advantageous to it than smaller ones 
however  this strategy also increases the company s dependence on these larger customers 
interest expense increased approximately  from the prior year to  the increase is due primarily to the company s borrowings on its revolving credit line 
the company uses its line of credit to finance its working capital needs  which have increased in conjunction with the start up of the imp contract and various other supply chain agreements

the continuing and sustained decline in general economic conditions during fiscal continued to negatively impact the company and the industry in which it operates 
in addition  two customers with formerly recurring business in the graphics segment together representing million in sales during fiscal reduced ongoing projects with the company  these actions both further reduced sales and will continue to affect sales going forward 
the lower sales reflect continued weakness in the promotional projects market  especially direct mail 
increased competitive pressures have also had a negative impact on prices 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the gross profit margin decreased million from fiscal to million 
gross margins decreased primarily as a result of reduced sales  a product sales mix that produced lower overall profit margins and the continued economic slowdown that continued to put a squeeze on the already competitive markets in which the company operates 
as a consequence of the downturn in sales and termination of certain relationships during the third quarter  the company was overstaffed for its remaining business  however  it decided to retain certain employees in excess of current needs in anticipation of the execution of the imp contract 
that decision increased employee related costs because the company did not take certain steps to lower labor costs than it otherwise would have taken 
in addition to these factors  the company incurred approximately  in direct charges in the fourth quarter for start up costs related to the imp contract 
inventory write offs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal inventory at may  was million  approximately million higher than at may  the increase in raw material inventory was primarily for clients whose projects began in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  the company began building finished goods inventory in conjunction with the signing of several new long term contracts

the company reported a loss related to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net of tax of  or per diluted common share 
effective june  the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement changed the accounting for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from an amortization approach to an impairment only approach 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment 
in the second step  the implied fair value of goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair values of all other tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair market value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
under adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets being amortized  were tested for impairment 
using the sfas no 
approach described above  the company estimated the fair values of its reporting units using the present value of future cash flows approach  subject to a comparison for reasonableness to its market capitalization at the date of valuation 
as a result  the company recorded a transitional goodwill impairment charge as of june  of approximately   net of income taxes  which is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of earnings 
the change in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segments were as follows graphics web total june     amortization    may     impairment charge   may    liquidity and capital resources as shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows  fiscal cash provided from operating activities was million as compared to million in fiscal the company s fiscal operating cash flow was negatively affected by a million increase in account and notes receivable and a million increase in inventory

of that amount  million is now in the form of a term loan 
the remainder is a revolving credit facility 
interest on the balance of any debt outstanding can vary with the company s selection to have the debt based upon margins over the bank determined preference or an ibor rate 
the company s actual rate is dependent upon the company s performance against a specific ratio as measured against a predetermined performance chart 
the company s failure to meet specified performance measures could adversely affect the company s ability to acquire future capital to meet its needs 
the company is subject to an unused line fee of 
to maintain its credit facility 
the facility now extends to june  as of may   the company had million outstanding on its revolving credit line at a rate of  as a result of increased working capital needs and increased capital expenditures  and is in compliance with all of its loan covenants 
as of august   the company has million outstanding on its revolving credit line and million outstanding under the term loan 
the company regularly reassesses how its various operations complement the company as a whole and considers strategic decisions to acquire new operations  expand  terminate  or sell certain existing operations 
these reviews resulted in various transactions during recent fiscal years and may result in additional transactions during fiscal and beyond 
on july   the company sold selected assets of its paragon direct division to ab data ltd 
effective june  through the transaction  a 
b data acquired certain customer relationships with customers who do business with paragon direct 
outlook group retained relationships with customers who use multiple outlook group services and can continue to make these types of services available to customers directly or through ongoing arrangements with ab data 
the company continues to pursue the sale of its troy  ohio facility 
this property is vacant and is not currently being sub leased 
the company previously had tenants and monthly rental income of approximately  for the sub lease of a portion of the building 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to sell or lease this property in a timely manner  or that it will receive and accept an offer that is profitable to the company 
the company s primary source of liquidity has been  and continues to be  cash flows 
the company s future cash flows are dependent upon and affected by many factors  including but not limited to the following the ability of the company to attract new and retain existing clients the ability of the company to recover increases in raw material prices the number and size of the projects completed for these customers the effects of any loss of business of one or more primary customers cancellations or delays of customer orders changes in sales mix changes in general economic conditions and world events management s effectiveness in managing the manufacturing process the ability to collect in full and in a timely manner  amounts due the company continued availability of bank financing additionally  liquidity will be affected by cash needs including the ability to acquire and maintain appropriate machinery and equipment start up costs for significant new client relationships  including working capital needs the ability to hire  train and retain a suitable work force acquisitions or divestiture activities capital asset additions or disposals environmental compliance matters risk and other cautionary factors in addition to the matters discussed earlier in this management s discussion and analysis  the company is subject to many factors  which can affect its operations  results and financial condition 
in addition to the factors which are discussed above  some other factors that could negatively affect the company s results and financial condition are set forth below 
the company is dependent upon its ability to retain its existing client base  and additionally  obtain new clients 
it s success will depend upon the company s ability to use existing technical and manufacturing capabilities and knowledge in the development and introduction of new value added products and services targeted at new markets and clients through increased marketing initiatives that allow the company to differentiate its products and services from that of its competitors 
the failure to utilize its capabilities or properly identify and address the evolving needs of targeted customers and markets  will limit the company s ability to capture and develop new business opportunities 
in addition  the company s success is dependent on its ability to manufacture products at a competitive cost and subsequently price them competitively 
the company s failure to do this could significantly affect the future profitability of the company 
the company is subject to price increases in many of its raw materials 
the company s failure to recover raw material price increases in pricing its products could have a negative affect on the future profitability of the company 
the company has not experienced difficulties in obtaining materials for its continuing operations in the past and does not consider itself dependent on any particular supplier for raw materials 
the raw materials consumed by the company include paper stocks  inks  and plastic films  all of which are readily available from numerous suppliers 
due to the project oriented nature of the company s business  the company s largest clients have historically tended to vary from year to year depending on the number and size of the projects completed for these clients 
as with many of the company s clients  the timing and volume of activities can vary significantly from period to period 
there can be no assurance that the volume from any one particular client will continue beyond the current period 
the supply chain agreement with imp  which is now the company s largest customer  and the company s only customer with sales in excess of during fiscal  results in an increased dependence upon sales to imp 
sales to imp were of the company s net sales in fiscal although significant long term contracts provide more stability to the company  they can increase the company s dependence on specific customers 
in particular  substantial portions of the company s sales are now represented by the imp contract 
the loss of imp sales would have a material adverse effect on the company s sales volume and profitability 
the loss of one or more principal clients or a change in the number or character of projects for particular clients could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales volume and profitability 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company was notified of reductions in volume by two of its major clients with ongoing projects 
these clients represented approximately million of sales during fiscal  and approximately million of sales during fiscal in addition  approximately million of calendar business was lost due to foreign competition 
many clients purchase the company s services under cancelable purchase orders rather than long term contracts 
while the company believes that operating without long term contracts is consistent with industry practices  it is committed to developing multi year projects that can add stability to its business 
the company continues to concentrate its efforts on increasing the number of clients with long term contracts  however  the failure of the company to add multi year projects would mean that the company would remain significantly dependent on project by project business  thus increasing the company s vulnerability to losses of business and significant period to period changes 
in addition  significant contracts  such as the contract with imp  expose the company to additional risks  which would result from non performance by the particular customer because of the relative significance of those contracts 
this would continue to make predictions of the company s future results very difficult 
even though the company is looking to increase the volume of longer term contract work  the company expects that it will continue to experience significant sales concentration given the relatively large size of projects accepted for certain clients 
due to the range of services that the company provides  the product sales mix can produce a range of profit margins 
some business in which the company operates  produce lower profit margins than others 
a substantial change in the mix of product sales  could materially affect profit margins 
the profit margin experienced for the current period  is not indicative of future profit margins 
the company believes that while there may be several competitors for individual services that it offers  few competitors offer the single source solution that the company can provide 
the company cannot assure the levels of its sales under its longer term contracts  including the imp contract 
many factors including contract disputes  performance problems  customer financial difficulties or changes in business strategies  changes in demand for the customer s products and or future negotiated change to the agreements could cause actual results to differ 
the september  terrorist attacks  the us and international response  the fear of additional attacks  the war with iraq and its aftermath  and other factors have substantially affected the united states economy as a whole 
some of these matters  such as the anthrax mailings  have specifically affected the industry in which the company operates because of their effect on promotional mailings 
these events could adversely affect business and operating results for an undeterminable period of time in ways that presently cannot be predicted 
technologies such as the internet will continue to affect the demand for printing services in general  and the continuing increases in postal rates and legislation changes such as the national do not call list and can spam limitations will likely impact the direct mail business in varying ways 
management s effectiveness in managing its manufacturing process will have a direct impact on its future profitability 
the company regularly makes decisions that affect production schedules  shipping schedules  employee levels  and inventory levels 
the company s ineffectiveness in managing these areas could have an effect on future profitability 
from time to time  the company has had significant accounts receivable or other amounts due from its customers or other parties 
on occasion  certain of these accounts receivable or other amounts due have become unusually large and or overdue  and the company has written off significant accounts receivable balances 
the failure of the company s customers to pay in full amounts due to the company could affect future profitability and liquidity and the company s reserves for these items may not be sufficient 
declining general economic conditions also increase the risk for the company  as many of its clients could negatively be impacted by the depressed economy 
as sales to contractual customers such as imp become a larger percentage of the company s sales and receivables  disputes or collection problems would likely affect a larger portion of the company s sales and or receivables 
additionally  several customers with contractual arrangements have extended payment terms although payments have generally been received according to the terms of the contract 
the company uses complex and specialized equipment to provide its services and manufacture its products  therefore  the company depends upon the functioning of such machinery and its ability to acquire and maintain appropriate equipment 
in addition  the company has acquired specialized machinery related to the imp arrangement and may need to acquire specific machinery in order to perform tasks for other customers or types of projects 
in certain cases  the cost of this machinery is factored into costs or prices charged to related customers  however  the costs may not be fully recovered  such as in the event sales to customers do not reach anticipated levels 
among other factors  the company may be affected by equipment malfunctions  the inability to configure machinery on a timely basis  training and operational needs related to the equipment  which may delay its utilization  maintenance requirements and technological or mechanical obsolescence 
in addition  larger companies with greater capital resources may have an advantage in financing state of the art equipment 
the company is dependent upon its ability to hire  train  and retain a skilled work force 
on occasion  the company will contract for and or hire temporary employees to increase the number of personnel in certain operations as project commitments require 
the company currently believes that it has appropriately aligned its staffing to be consistent with its current and anticipated levels of business activity 
the failure of the company to properly align and maintain skilled staffing levels could affect the future profitability of the company 
in addition  as occurred in the third quarter of fiscal  the company may in the future again incur additional employee expenses because of the need to maintain a work force in excess of current needs to service anticipated customer products  such a decision would increase expenses in the short term 
the company regularly reassesses how its various operations complement the company as a whole and considers strategic decisions to acquire new operations or expand  terminate or sell certain existing operations 
there can be no assurance that any decisions to acquire new operations  expand  terminate or sell certain existing operations will be implemented successfully 
acquisitions  in particular  are subject to potential problems and inherent risks  including difficulties in identifying  financing and completing viable acquisitions difficulties in integrating the acquired company  retaining the acquired company s customers and achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition  such as expected revenue increases and cost savings loss of key employees of the acquired company the resulting diversion of managements attention away from current operations the assumption of undisclosed liabilities the company s failure to successfully implement any initiatives could affect future profitability 
from time to time  the company may sell or dispose of assets  which it feels are under performing or are no longer needed in the businesses in which the company operates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell or dispose of the assets in a manner  which is profitable to the company 
in addition  the company will make investments in assets that it feels are needed to acquire and maintain the businesses in which the company operates 
again  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire the necessary assets  or that the company can obtain a reasonable return on the investments 
the company and the industry in which it operates are subject to environmental laws and regulation concerning emissions into the air  discharges into waterways and the generation  handling and disposal of waste materials 
these laws and regulations are constantly evolving  making it difficult to predict the effect they may have upon the future capital expenditures  profitability and competitive position of the company 
growth in the company s production capacity with a resultant increase in discharges and emissions could require significant capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the future 
disclosures about off balance sheet obligations  contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company has no off balance sheet arrangements  which would otherwise constitute balance sheet liabilities 
see below  however  for information regarding the company s operating leases 
the sec believes that investors would find it beneficial if aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments were provided in a single location such that a total picture of obligations would be readily available 
in addition  the sec had suggested the use of a least one additional aid to present the total picture of a registrant s liquidity and capital resource and the integral role of on and off balance sheet arrangements may be schedules of contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the latest balance sheet date 
the company had no commercial commitments to report as of the latest balance sheet date 
less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligation operating lease    unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations    in addition  at may  the company had borrowed million against its million bank revolver agreement 
the company is in compliance with its covenants under the related agreement 
in august  the credit agreement was renewed and expanded to million 
of that amount  million is a term facility and the balance remains under a revolver 
disclosures about certain trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value the company does not have any trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
disclosures about effects of transactions with related and certain other parties as previously reported  the company agreed to make loans to certain officers and key employees to purchase the common stock of the company 
at may   the company had loans totaling  the loans bear an interest rate of and are for a five year term 
it is the company s policy that all material transactions between the company  its officers  directors or principal shareholders  or affiliates of any of them  shall be on terms no less favorable to the company than those which could have been obtained if the transaction had been with unaffiliated third parties on an arm s length  and such transactions are approved by a majority of the members of the audit committee of the board of directors  or a majority of the directors who are independent and not financially interested in the transactions 
in his original employment agreement  the company agreed to make a loan to mr 
baksha of up to  to purchase the company s common stock 
the term of the loan would be five years at the same rate of interest charged company pursuant to its line of credit at the time of such loan 
such a loan was made to mr 
baksha in july  at an interest rate of per annum 
this was adjusted to in fiscal to match the rate on the loans discussed below 
the loan principal was due in july  interest was due annually 
mr 
baksha has repaid this loan in fiscal in accordance with its terms 
because of the changes in law  the company could not modify or extend mr 
baksha s loan or take other related action consistent with the company s desire to encourage mr 
baksha s continued ownership 
to assist in providing liquidity to mr 
baksha for the repayment of the loan  on july   the company repurchased from him  shares of common stock at per share  the average of the high and low trading prices for that day and the preceding two trading days 
mr 
baksha used the proceeds to repay his note as provided above 
as a result of legislation enacted on july   the company will no longer make or modify loans to its officers  however  outstanding amounts at that date may continue until paid in accordance with their terms 
disclosure about critical accounting policies the company has a variety of accounting policies that affect the way it applies generally accepted accounting principles to its financial statements 
some of these policies require that the company exercise judgment 
the most significant of these policies are discussed below 
the more critical of these policies include revenue recognition and the use of estimates which inherently involve judgment and uncertainties in valuing inventory  accounts receivable  fixed assets  and intangible assets 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee and its board of directors 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized by the company when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a selling arrangement exists  the company s price to the customer is fixed  collectibility is reasonably assured  and title has transferred to the customer 
generally  these criteria are met at the time of shipment 
the company also offers certain of its customers the right to return products that do no meet the standards agreed upon 
the company continuously monitors and tracks such product returns  and while such returns have historically been minimal  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same return rates that it has in the past 
any significant increase in product quality failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
accounts and notes receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by the review of the customers current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
the company values accounts and notes receivable  net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the allowance is calculated based upon the company s evaluation of specific customer accounts where the company has information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations bankruptcy  etc in these cases  the company uses its judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for the customer against amounts due  to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
the same technique was used to compute this allowance at may  and however  the ultimate collectibility of a receivable is dependent upon the financial condition of an individual customer  which could change rapidly and without advance warning 
inventory the company continues to use the same techniques to value inventory as have been used in the past 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
raw materials and work in process are based on actual costs 
finished goods are valued based upon average selling prices and gross margins applicable to the related customer and product 
valuing inventories at either method requires the use of estimates and judgment 
as discussed under further disclosures concerning liquidity and capital resources  including off balance sheet arrangements  customers may cancel their order  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons 
any of these  or certain additional actions  could create excess inventory levels  which would impact the valuation of inventory 
any actions taken by the company s customers that could impact the value of inventory are considered when determining inventory valuations 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on its forecast of product demand and production requirements 
generally  the company does not experience issues with obsolete inventory due to the nature of its products 
if the company were not able to achieve its expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value  the company would have to adjust its reserves accordingly 
fixed assets and goodwill the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of during fiscal in accordance with the provision of sfas  the company reviews property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future net cash flows which the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property  plant and equipment  if any  exceeds its fair market value 
on june   the company adopted the provision of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets for evaluating and establishing any reserves for intangible assets determined to be impaired 
going forward the company will need to review goodwill and other indefinite lived assets on at least an annual basis to determine whether they are impaired 
the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of   net of taxes during fiscal  in its graphics segment 
the impairment has been recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the consolidated statements of operations 
recently issued financial accounting pronouncements on january   the financial accounting standards board fasb or the board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin or the interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
the primary objective of the interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as variable interest entities vies 
this statement as subsequently amended is effective for the company at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption of this rule did not have a material effect on the company s financial statement 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb or the board issued fasb statement no 
fas or the standard  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity

other in general  the company believes that the effects of inflation on the company have not been material in recent years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management activities may include forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties
