among the important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning the anticipated growth of the information technology industry  the continued need of current and prospective customers for the company s services  the availability of qualified professional staff  and price and wage inflation 
revenue generating activities the majority of the company s revenues are derived from professional services rendered in the information technology sector 
the company also owned a stand alone software products company  princeton softech inc  princeton which accounted for less than of consolidated revenues in on march   the net assets of princeton were sold for a cash payment of approximately million 
the company operates its business in three basic segments  it services  the solutions group and chimes  inc the distinctions between the it services and solutions group segments primarily relate to the management and supervision of services performed and related gross margins 
chimes  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of chc  provides workforce procurement and management services to global companies 
the it services business consists of providing technology consultants to large organizations on a temporary hire basis 
the consultant work is supervised and managed by the customer 
for the most recent year  this segment represented approximately of total revenues 
the it services business tends to be a lower risk  lower gross margin business with very competitive pricing 
the solutions group  tends to be a higher margin  higher risk business  due to the fact that the company is responsible for project deliverables and other conditions contained in statements of work and or contracts with customers 
virtually all projects performed by the solutions group are it related and consist of practices such as application development  outsourcing arrangements  government services  health insurance portability and accountability act  hipaa  services  technology training and managed services 
for the year  the solutions group excluding chimes accounted for of consolidated revenues 
the company s customer relationships are memorialized in a master agreement  which address the terms and conditions which define the client engagement 
depending on the service to be performed for the client  either a task order in the case of a staffing engagement or a statement of work sow in the case of a solutions engagement is generated 
the sow is signed by both the company and the customer 
in general  no solutions work is done unless there is a sow because the sow provides the technical details of the work to be done 
the sow  although falling under the corresponding master agreement  is a stand alone binding contractual document  typically outlining the project objectives  describing the personnel who will work on the project  describing phases of the project  the timeframes for work performance  and the rate of compensation  on a time and material basis 
in the event that the parameters of the project expand or otherwise change  a project change request is implemented  to memorialize whatever change has occurred to the deliverables  personnel and or time and material 
the master agreements  in conjunction with the sow s  are written to define  with as much detail as possible  the client relationship and all aspects of the work to be performed for the client 
with regard to revenues expected in future periods  each sow has a defined term or sets forth the anticipated length of a project 
where a client engagement is on going  like certain help desk type services  the master agreements would still have a term length  but would recite that the agreement was renewable 
generally  solutions engagements are for a year or less 
staffing engagements can and do last for more than a year  with variations in the number of consultants being provided at any given time 
staffing engagements are generally cancelable by clients with a two to four week notice period 
chimes  inc is a human capital management solution that  through the use of proprietary software and processes  manages the temporary workforce of large organizations 
during  chimes accounted for approximately of total revenues 
critical accounting policies the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements are related to revenue recognition  the evaluation of the bad debt reserve  the valuation of goodwill and the valuation of the deferred tax asset 
revenue recognition approximately and of consolidated revenue in and  respectively  was derived from time and material contracts 
for the it services division revenues are recognized as services are performed under time and material contracts 
under a typical time and material billing arrangement  our customers are billed on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period  revenue is estimated and accrued for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are billed the following month 
the solutions group recognizes revenue either on a time and material basis or on a fixed fee basis  however  principally on a time and material basis 
for fixed fee contracts  revenue is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs 
each fixed fee contract has different terms  milestones and deliverables 
the milestones and deliverables primarily relate to the work to be performed and the timing of the billing 
at the end of each reporting period an assessment of revenue recognized on the percentage of completion and milestones achieved criteria is made 
if it becomes apparent that estimated cost will be exceeded or required milestones or deliverables will not have been obtained  an adjustment will be made 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimated revenues and costs are recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the impact of any revisions become known 
unbilled accounts receivable  in the it services and solutions group  represent amounts recognized as revenue based on services performed in advance of customer billings principally on a time and material basis 
at the end of each accounting period  revenue is accrued for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are billed the following month 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on fixed fee contracts arise when percentage of completion accounting is used 
such amounts are billed at specific dates or at contract completion 
the company s chimes subsidiary recognizes revenue on a transaction fee basis 
the chimes service offering aggregates the suppliers of temporary workers to the customer and renders one invoice to the customer 
upon payment from the customer  chimes deducts a transaction fee and remits the balance of the client payment to the applicable vendor 
chimes recognizes only their fee for the service  not the aggregate billing to the customer 
the gross amount of the customer invoicing is not considered revenue or receivable to chimes because there is no earnings process for the gross amount and by contract terms  chimes is not obligated to pay the vendor until paid by the customer 
princeton softech  inc  which was sold in  recognized revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and aicpa statement of position sop 
under sop  the company recognized software license revenue when a noncancelable license agreement had been executed  fees were fixed and determinable  the software had been delivered and collection was considered probable 
evaluation of bad debt reserve the company determines its bad debt reserve by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board approved the issuance of sfas no 
 business combinations and in july  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the new standards require that all business combinations initiated after june  must be accounted for under the purchase method 
in addition  all intangible assets acquired that are obtained through contractual or legal right  or are capable of being separately sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged are recognized as an asset apart from goodwill 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization  but are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the company adopted sfas as of january  and in compliance with this new regulation has discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
during the quarter ended june   the company completed the initial valuation of the carrying value of goodwill existing at january  as a result  a non cash charge of million  or per share was retroactively recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the six months ended june  statement of operations 
for the years ended december  and  the company completed valuations of the carrying value of the remaining goodwill and it was determined that no impairment had occurred at either date 
the reporting units are equal to  or one level below  reportable segments 
the company engaged independent valuation consultants to assist with the transitional goodwill and annual impairment tests 
as of december  and  the fair value of each of the reporting units was calculated using the following approaches i market approach and ii income approach 
under the market approach  value is estimated by comparing the performance fundamentals relating to similar public companies stock prices 
multiples are then developed of the value of the publicly traded stock to various measures and are then applied to each reporting unit to estimate the value of its equity 
under the income approach  value was determined using the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
the fair value conclusion of the reporting units reflects an appropriately weighted value of the market multiple approach and the income approach discussed above 
an asset approach was not used because the asset approach is most relevant for liquidation approaches  investment company valuations and asset rich company valuations ie real estate entities and was not deemed relevant for manufacturing and service company going concern valuations 
when either the income approach or the market approach was used  each indicated value of the solutions entity s equity exceeded the carrying value of the solutions entity by at least million and million as of december  and  respectively 
since each of the two approaches yielded values in excess of carrying value  any weighting of the two approaches or either approach used alone results in the same conclusion  that the goodwill was not impaired 
when the other entities  of the company  were tested it services and education  in the second quarter initial valuation  both approaches yielded an indicated value which was below the carrying value of those entity s equity  in such an amount that the entire amount of goodwill was written off 
as a result  a loss of million was recognized in june and recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
there was no income tax effect on the impairment charge as approximately million of the charge related to goodwill in foreign tax jurisdictions where the company believes it is more likely than not that future taxable income in these jurisdictions will not be sufficient to realize the related income tax benefits associated with the charge 
the remaining million of the charge was related primarily to goodwill that was acquired prior to the ability to deduct goodwill for tax purposes 
valuation of the deferred tax asset the company records deferred tax assets for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and their respective tax bases  and to operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers the scheduled reversal periods of the deferred tax assets as well as projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies
