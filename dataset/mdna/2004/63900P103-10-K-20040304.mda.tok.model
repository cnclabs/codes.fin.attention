table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information  see the notes to the historical financial statements 
after the introduction  there is a separate section for each of natural resource partners lp  western pocahontas properties limited partnership  great northern properties limited partnership  new gauley coal corporation and the arch coal contributed properties 
the arch coal contributed properties include the properties contributed to us by ark land company  a subsidiary of arch coal  inc executive overview natural resource partners lp is a master limited partnership formed by the wpp group and arch coal  inc we completed our initial public offering in october we engage principally in the business of owning and managing coal properties in the three major coal producing regions of the united states appalachia  the illinois basin and the western united states 
as of december   we controlled approximately billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves in eight states 
we lease coal reserves to experienced mine operators under long term leases that grant the operators the right to mine our coal reserves in exchange for royalty payments 
as of december   our reserves were subject to leases with lessees 
for the year ended december   approximately of the coal produced from our properties came from underground mines and approximately came from surface mines 
as of december   approximately of our reserves were low sulfur coal 
included in our low sulfur reserves is compliance coal  which constitutes approximately of our reserves 
coal produced from our properties is burned in electric power plants located east of the mississippi river and in montana and minnesota 
in the year ended december   our lessees produced million tons of coal from our properties and our total revenues were million 
in addition  approximately of our coal royalty revenues were from metallurgical coal  which was sold to steel companies in the eastern united states  south america  europe and asia 
our revenue and profitability are dependent on our lessees ability to mine and market our coal reserves 
coal royalties are paid to us on the basis of a percentage of the sales price of the coal  subject to a minimum royalty per ton 
in addition  our leases specify minimum monthly  quarterly or annual royalties 
these minimum royalties are generally recoupable over a specified period of time usually three to five years if sufficient royalties are generated from coal production in future periods 
we do not recognize these minimum coal royalties as revenue until the applicable recoupment period has expired or they are recouped through production 
until recognized as revenue  these minimum royalties are carried as deferred revenue  a liability on the balance sheet 
most of our coal is produced by large companies  many of which are publicly traded  with professional and sophisticated sales departments 
we estimate that of our coal is sold by our lessees under coal supply contracts that have terms of one year or more 
however  coal supply contracts with terms of one year or more are becoming increasingly rare  and our coal royalty revenue stream is increasingly affected by changes in market price of coal 
coal prices are based on supply and demand  specific coal characteristics  economics of alternative fuel  and overall domestic and international economic conditions 
during the last few years  steam coal prices have varied greatly 
while higher than average spot prices prevailed for most of  in late prices declined as demand for coal fell due to unusually warm weather during the winter of and the sluggish us economy 
in contrast  the winter of was colder than normal in many parts of the united states 
as a result of the increased demand for electricity for heating resulting from this colder weather  electric utilities used substantial amounts of coal to generate electricity and reduced the size of their stockpiles 
additionally  the weaker us dollar  especially against the euro and the australian dollar  and the increase in ocean going freight rates caused an increase in demand for export coal because the united states was better able to 
table of contents compete with australia for the european market 
thus  in  our lessees experienced a greater demand for coal  and spot prices increased about 
we expect these increased spot prices to begin to affect our results of operations in because our lessees received previously contracted prices for much of their production in prices of metallurgical coal have increased substantially in the past year 
metallurgical coal  because of its unique chemical characteristics  is usually priced higher than steam coal 
metallurgical coal production gradually decreased during the years prior to due to a decline in exports as a result of the strength of the us dollar and increasing use of electric arc furnaces and pulverized coal  rather than metallurgical coal  for steel production 
with the weakening of the dollar and the increase in ocean going freight rates  us metallurgical coal has become more competitive and exports seem to be increasing 
the ventilation disruption resulting in the closure of pinnoak resources pinnacle mine in west virginia  together with the closure of another low vol metallurgical mine in alabama have caused a critical shortage of that type of coal and a substantial increase in its price 
metallurgical coal can also be used as steam coal 
however  some metallurgical coal mines on our properties may only operate profitably if all or a portion of their production is sold as metallurgical coal 
if the operators of these mines are unable to sell metallurgical coal  these mines may not be economically viable and may be closed 
in addition to coal royalty revenues  we generated approximately of our revenue from rentals  royalties on oil and gas and coalbed methane leases  overriding royalty arrangements and wheelage payments  which are toll payments for the right to transport third party coal over or through our property 
most of our lessees are required to reimburse us for property taxes paid on the leased property 
these property tax reimbursements are shown as revenue in our financial statements 
we include the corresponding property tax expenses as taxes other than income 
however  a portion of our property taxes are not reimbursed due to the terms in the lease 
the wpp group s property tax expenses are higher than its property tax revenue because the wpp group retained certain properties and because some of the properties contributed by the wpp group are unleased and  therefore  no reimbursements are received 
general and administrative expenses include salary and benefits  rent  expenses and other costs related to managing the properties 
an affiliate charged the wpp group for certain finance  tax  treasury and insurance expenses 
the arch coal contributed properties did not maintain stand alone corporate treasury  legal  tax  human resources  general administration or other similar corporate support functions 
corporate general and administrative expenses were not previously allocated to the arch coal contributed properties because there was not sufficient information to develop a reasonable cost allocation 
we reimburse the general partner and its affiliates for direct and indirect expenses they incur on our behalf  including general and administrative expenses 
depletion and amortization consist primarily of depletion on the coal properties 
depletion of coal reserves is calculated on a unit of production basis and thus fluctuates from property to property with coal production for the period 
acquisitions since our initial public offering in october  we have completed six significant acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of million 
these acquisitions included approximately million tons of coal reserves  or million tons net of production  on approximately one million mineral acres 
in connection with these acquisitions  we have added new lessees and new leases 
all of the acquired properties are located in appalachia and were integrated with our existing operations 
all of the acquisitions were initially funded under our revolving credit facility 
in connection with our issuance of million in senior notes in june and september  we converted a portion of those borrowings to long term debt 
blc properties 
in january  we purchased all of the mineral interests of blc properties llc for million 
this acquisition included coal  oil and gas and other mineral rights on approximately  acres that contain approximately million tons of coal reserves 
we lease these reserves to eight different lessees 
the transaction also included oil and gas and other mineral rights on approximately  additional 
table of contents acres 
the properties are located in kentucky  tennessee  west virginia  virginia  and alabama 
blc retained a non participating royalty interest in the oil and gas and other mineral rights 
eastern kentucky reserves 
in november  we acquired coal reserves and related interests in eastern kentucky from a number of private sellers for million 
the acquisition included approximately million tons of coal reserves  an additional royalty interest in approximately million tons of coal reserves on contiguous property  and the right to collect a wheelage fee  which is a toll paid to transport coal across or through our properties  on million tons of coal 
we lease these reserves to appalachian fuels 
pinnoak resources 
in july  we acquired approximately million tons of coal reserves and an overriding royalty interest on additional coal reserves from subsidiaries of pinnoak resources  llc for million 
we lease these reserves to other subsidiaries of pinnoak resources 
pinnoak resources produces low volatile metallurgical coal from these longwall mines and has onsite preparation plants 
the properties consist of coal reserves located at two mine complexes the pinnacle mine in pineville  west virginia and the oak grove mine near birmingham  alabama 
alpha natural resources reserves 
in april  we acquired approximately  mineral acres containing approximately million tons of coal reserves from two subsidiaries of alpha natural resources  llc for million 
we leased most of these reserves to two alpha subsidiaries and seven other operators 
the properties are located in virginia adjacent to the coal properties that we acquired from el paso corporation in december  which are operated by another subsidiary of alpha natural resources  llc 
alpha natural resources royalty interest 
in february  we purchased an overriding royalty interest in the coal reserves that we purchased from el paso corporation in december from a subsidiary of alpha natural resources llc for million 
el paso properties 
in december  we purchased million tons of coal reserves from el paso corporation for million 
we lease these reserves to alpha natural resources and thirteen other lessees 
more than half of the reserves are in kentucky  and the remainder are located in virginia and west virginia 
we also acquired the mineral rights in  acres that generate minor amounts of revenues from timber  oil and gas and other leases 
pinnacle update in september  the pinnacle mine in west virginia  which mines coal from the reserves we acquired from pinnoak resources in july  was idled following a ventilation disruption believed to have been caused by a lightning strike 
on december   we received a force majeure notice from pinnacle mining company  llc regarding the mine 
the notice allows pinnacle to forego payment of the minimum royalties due under the lease terms until the mine is again in production 
the pinnacle mine produces metallurgical coal for which we receive higher prices than steam coal 
although we expected this mine to generate coal royalty revenues of about million per year  we have not received any coal royalty revenues or minimum royalties from the operator of this mine since it was idled and will not until mining operations resume 
if the mine does not reopen  we would lose some or all of our investment in these reserves 
in february  a team of mine rescue personnel  consisting of trained pinnacle employees and representatives from the us mining safety and health administration and the west virginia office of miners health safety training  entered the mine to examine and assess the conditions 
pinnacle s management is continuing to work with government officials and the united mine workers to reopen the mine 
critical accounting policies coal royalties 
we recognize coal royalty revenues on the basis of tons of coal sold by our lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales 
generally  the lessees make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of coal they sell  subject to minimum monthly  quarterly or annual payments 
these minimum royalties are generally recoupable over a specified period of time usually three to five years if sufficient royalties are generated from coal production in future periods 

table of contents we do not recognize these minimum coal royalties as revenue until the applicable recoupment period has expired or they are recouped through production 
until recognized as revenue  these minimum royalties are carried as deferred revenue  a liability on the balance sheet 
timber royalties 
we sell timber on a contract basis where independent contractors harvest and sell the timber and  from time to time  in a competitive bid process involving sales of standing timber on individual parcels 
we recognize timber revenues when the timber has been sold or harvested by the independent contractors 
title and risk of loss pass to the independent contractors when they harvest the timber 
oil and gas royalties 
oil and gas royalties are recognized on the basis of volume of hydrocarbons sold by lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales 
generally  the lessees make payments based on a percentage of the selling price 
some leases are subject to minimum annual payments or delay rentals 
the minimum annual payments that are recoupable are generally recoupable over certain periods 
the minimum payments are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized either when the lessee recoups the minimum payments through production or when the period during which the lessee is allowed to recoup the minimum payment expires 
depletion 
we deplete coal properties on a units of production basis by lease  based upon coal mined in relation to the net cost of the mineral properties and estimated proved and probable tonnage in those properties 
we estimate proven and probable coal reserves with the assistance of third party mining consultants  and we use estimation techniques and recoverability assumptions 
our estimates of coal reserves are updated periodically and may result in adjustments to coal reserves and depletion rates that are recognized prospectively 
historical revisions have not been material 
timberlands are stated at cost less depletion 
we determine the cost of the timber harvested based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the amount of estimated net merchantable volume by geographic areas 
we estimate our timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
we update these estimates annually  which may result in adjustments of timber volumes and depletion rates that are recognized prospectively 
changes in these estimates have no effect on our cash flow 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred  with the associated asset retirement cost being capitalized as a part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
also includes disclosure requirements that provide a description of asset retirement obligations and a reconciliation of changes in the components of those obligations 
the operators of mines on our leased property are responsible for asset retirement obligations 
therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
on january  did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
among other things  sfas no 
requires gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under sfas no 
the provisions of this statement related to the rescission of sfas no 
apply to fiscal years beginning after may  adoption of sfas no 
on january  did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which supersedes eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employment termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
sfas no 
requires companies to record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized only when the liability is incurred instead of at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal activity 
adoption of this standard is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our financial statements 

table of contents in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
as a result of decisions previously made as part of the derivatives implementation group dig process  changes made in connection with other fasb projects dealing with financial instruments  and deliberations in connection with issues raised in relation to the application of the definition of a derivative 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  however  the provisions of sfas no 
that merely represent the codification of previous dig decisions are already effective and continue to be applied in accordance with their prior respective effective dates 
management does not expect sfas no 
to have any impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity was issued in may sfas no 
requires certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity to be classified as liabilities 
many of these instruments previously were classified as equity or temporary equity and as such  sfas no 
represents a significant change in practice in the accounting for a number of financial instruments  including mandatorily redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives that frequently are used in connection with share repurchase programs 
sfas no 
is effective for public companies for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and to other instruments at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  july  for calendar quarter companies 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur 
fin no 
also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
fin no 
was effective for all vie s created after january  for vie s created prior to february   fin no 
was to be effective for public companies on july  however  the fasb postponed that effective date to december  in december  the fasb issued a revised fin no 
fin no 
r  which further delayed the effective date for public companies to march  for vie s created prior to february   except for interests in special purpose entities  for which a company must adopt either fin no 
or fin no 
r as of december  adoption of the requirements of fin no 
r is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
historical practice in the extractive industry has been to classify leased mineral interests on the same basis as owned minerals due to similar rights of the lessor 
however  sfas no 
 business combinations  provides mineral rights as an example of a contract based intangible asset that should be considered for separate classification as the result of a business combination 
due to the potential for inconsistencies in applying the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in the extractive industries as they relate to mineral interests controlled by other than fee ownership  the emerging issues task force the eitf has established a mining industry working group that is currently addressing this issue 
at december  and  coal acquisition costs for leased mineral interests were less than of our total assets 
the classification of our leased coal interests and contractual agreements may be revised depending upon the conclusions reached by the mining industry working group and the eitf 
any reclassification would not have an effect on net income or net cash flows

in  production increased by million tons  from million tons to million tons  or  compared to substantially all of the increases in production and coal royalty revenues were from the properties and an overriding royalty interest that we acquired since our initial public offering 
other than approximately one month of production from the properties we acquired from el paso in december  all of the production and coal royalty revenues attributable to our acquisitions are reflected in our results 
other increases in coal royalty revenues and production were due to appalachia 
coal royalty revenues in appalachia in were million compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
in  production in appalachia was million tons compared to million tons in  an increase of million tons  or 
as noted above  the increases in both coal royalty revenues and production primarily resulted from the acquisitions we have completed since our initial public offering 
in addition to the acquisitions  production from our west fork property increased from million tons to million tons  and coal royalty revenues increased from million to million because a longwall mine moved onto the property from adjacent property and was on our property for the entire year versus a portion of the year in on our lynch property  production decreased from million tons to million tons while coal royalty revenue increased from million to million 
this increase in royalty revenue was due to a slightly higher average selling price for the production of our lessee 
these increases were partially offset by lower royalty revenue from our evans laviers  eunice and lone mountain properties 
on our evans laviers property  production decreased from million tons to 
table of contents million tons and coal royalty revenues decreased from million to million 
this decrease was a combination of a higher royalty surface mine being idle for most of the year and an underground mine having higher production during the current year 
on our eunice property  production remained constant at million tons but coal royalty revenues decreased from million to million because a greater proportion of the production came from the lower royalty surface mine 
on our lone mountain property production remained constant at million tons while royalty revenue decreased from million to million due to a slightly lower average selling price from the production of our lessee

this increase was due to a larger proportion of the production from the mine being on our property 
northern powder river 
production from our western energy property increased from million tons to million tons and royalty revenue increased from million to million 
this increase was due to the typical variations in production resulting from the checkerboard ownership pattern of the mine and a higher average selling price for the production from our property

the leases provide for payments to us based on the higher of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed minimum per ton of coal sold from the properties  with minimum annual royalty payments 
under the ark land leases  minimum royalty payments are credited against future production royalties 
the leases are intended to allow ark land to retain some of the legal rights possessed when it owned the properties 
for this reason  the leases contain some terms and provisions that are different from our third party coal leases negotiated at arm s length 
some of the more significant differences include ark land has the ability to sublease the leased property without our prior approval  although it remains responsible for sublessee performance  minimum royalty payments from ark land continue to be payable during the initial lease term even if all mineable and merchantable coal has been mined from the property  royalties for coal sold to any affiliates may be based on a gross selling price below the market value of the coal  the indemnities provided by ark land to us do not survive the termination of the leases  we only have a limited ability to terminate the leases  ark land has royalty free wheelage rights on the leased properties  and the leases do not impose a legal duty to diligently mine the maximum amount of coal possible from the leased property 
we believe that the production and minimum royalty rates contained in the ark land leases are consistent with current market royalty rates

table of contents environmental the operations our lessees conduct on our properties are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted 
as an owner of surface interests in some properties  we may be liable for certain environmental conditions occurring at the surface properties 
the terms of substantially all of our coal leases require the lessee to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations 
lessees post reclamation bonds assuring that reclamation will be completed as required by the relevant permit  and substantially all of the leases require the lessee to indemnify us against  among other things  environmental liabilities 
some of these indemnifications survive the termination of the lease 
because we have no employees  employees of western pocahontas properties make regular visits to the mines to ensure compliance with lease terms  but the duty to comply with all regulations rests with the lessees 
we believe that our lessees will be able to comply with existing regulations and do not expect any lessee s failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

risks related to our business we may not have sufficient cash from operations to pay the minimum quarterly distribution following establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses  including payments to our general partner 
a substantial or extended decline in coal prices could reduce our coal royalty revenues and the value of our coal reserves 
our lessees coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that could result in lower coal royalty revenues to us 

table of contents we depend on a limited number of primary operators for a significant portion of our coal royalty revenues  and the loss of or reduction in production from any of our major operators could reduce our coal royalty revenues 
we may not be able to terminate our leases  and we may experience delays and be unable to replace lessees that do not make royalty payments 
if our lessees do not manage their operations well  their production volumes and our coal royalty revenues could decrease 
adverse developments in the coal industry could reduce our coal royalty revenues  and could substantially reduce our total revenues due to our lack of asset diversification 
any decrease in the demand for metallurgical coal could result in lower coal production by our lessees  which would thereby reduce our coal royalty revenues 
we may not be able to expand and our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to replace or increase our reserves or obtain other mineral reserves through acquisitions 
any change in fuel consumption patterns by electric power generators resulting in a decrease in the use of coal could result in lower coal production by our lessees  which would reduce our coal royalty revenues 
current conditions in the coal industry may make it difficult for our lessees to extend existing contracts or enter into supply contracts with terms of one year or more  which could adversely affect the stability and profitability of their operations and adversely affect our coal royalty revenues 
competition within the coal industry may adversely affect the ability of our lessees to sell coal  and excess production capacity in the industry could put downward pressure on coal prices 
lessees could satisfy obligations to their customers with coal from properties other than ours  depriving us of the ability to receive amounts in excess of minimum royalty payments 
fluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of transportation could reduce the production of coal mined from our properties 
our reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may be inaccurate  which could materially adversely affect the quantities and value of our reserves 
our lessees work forces could become increasingly unionized in the future 
we may be exposed to changes in interest rates because our current borrowings under our revolving credit facility may be subject to variable interest rates based upon libor 
our lessees are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that may limit their ability to produce and sell coal from our properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  which includes adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below commodity price risk we are dependent upon the efficient marketing of the coal mined by our lessees 
our lessees sell the coal under various long term and short term contracts as well as on the spot market 
in previous years  a large portion of these sales were under long term contracts 
current conditions in the coal industry may make it difficult for our lessees to extend existing contracts or enter into supply contracts with terms of one year or more 
we estimate that of our coal is sold by our lessees under coal supply contracts that have terms of one year or more 
our lessees failure to negotiate long term contracts could adversely affect the stability and 
table of contents profitability of our lessees operations and adversely affect our coal royalty revenues 
as more coal is sold on the spot market  coal royalty revenues may become more volatile due to fluctuations in spot coal prices 
interest rate risk our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our current borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which may be subject to variable interest rates based upon libor 
as of december   we did not have any financial instruments in place to hedge our interest rate risk because interest rates have remained at historically low levels 
in may  in anticipation of the issuance of million of senior unsecured notes  we entered into a treasury rate lock agreement for up to million of the debt 
upon closing of the senior notes in june  we paid million to settle the treasury rate agreement 
however  because a portion of the treasury rate instrument did not qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes  we expensed million in  and million is being amortized over the year term of the applicable note 
management intends to monitor interest rates and may enter into interest rate instruments to protect against increased borrowing costs 
at december   we had outstanding million of variable interest rate debt 
if libor rates were to increase by basis points  annual interest expense would increase by  assuming the same principal amount remained outstanding during the year
