the terms of these agreements provide no limitation to the maximum potential future payments  however  in most instances the amount to be paid will not be less than the pro rata net book value total assets minus total liabilities of the subsidiary 
during  the company made such payments of million  which were principally capitalized as cost in excess of net assets of companies acquired offset by the carrying value of the minority interest 
if the put or call options on outstanding agreements were exercised at december   such payments would be approximately million million at december   which would principally be capitalized as cost in excess of net assets of companies acquired 
as these payments are based on the future earnings of the acquired companies  the amounts will change as the performance of these subsidiaries change

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to uncollectible receivables  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and integration costs  and contingencies and litigation  on an ongoing basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estim ates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue typically is recognized at time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  and returns 
a portion of the company s business involves shipments directly from its suppliers to its customers 
in these transactions  the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer  payment to the supplier  establishing payment terms with the customer  product returns  and has risk of loss if the customer does not make payment 
as the principal with the customer  the company recognizes revenue when the company is notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped 
in addition  the company has certain business with select customers and suppliers that is accounted for on an agency basis that is  the company recognizes the fees associated with serving as an agent in sales with no associated cost of sales in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
in such cases  the terms of the transactions govern revenue recognition 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are determined using a combination of factors  including the length of time the receivables are outstanding  the current business environment  and historical experience 
in addition  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
write downs of inventories to market value are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection  stock rotation  and obsolescence  as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the book cost of inventories 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
the company assesses its investments accounted for as available for sale on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in market value below cost are other than temporary 
when the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the cost basis for the individual security is reduced and a loss is realized in the period in which it occurs 
the company makes such determination based upon the quoted market price  financial condition  operating results of the investee  and the company s intent and ability to retain the investment over a period of time which would be sufficient to allow for any recovery in market value 
in addition  the company assesses the following factors broad economic factors impacting the investee s industry  publicly available forecasts for sales and earnings growth for the industry and investee  and the cyclical nature of the investee s industry 
the company could potentially have an impairment charge in future periods if  among other factors  the investee s future earnings differ from currently available forecasts 
the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance to the deferred tax assets would be established in the period such determination was made 
the company uses various financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  for purposes other than trading 
derivatives used as part of the company s risk management strategy are designated at inception as hedges and measured for effectiveness both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
the company has also entered into interest rate swap transactions that convert certain fixed rate debt to variable rate debt  effectively hedging the change in fair value of the fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
the fair value hedges and the hedged debt are adjusted to current market values through interest expense 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits  and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
the company assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcomes for these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments 
the company has recorded charges in connection with restructuring its businesses  as well as the integration of acquired businesses 
these reserves principally include estimates related to employee separation costs  the consolidation of facilities including estimates of sub lease income  contractual obligations  and the valuation of certain assets including accounts receivable  inventories  and investments 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
the costs and obligations of the company s defined benefit pension plan are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
the two critical assumptions used which impact the net periodic pension cost income and the benefit obligation are the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate represents the market rate for a high quality corporate bond and the expected return on plan assets is based on current and expected asset allocations  historical trends  and expected returns on plan assets 
these key assumptions are evaluated annually 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  as well as the related estimated useful lives 
in determining the fair value  the company makes certain judgments  including the identification of reporting units and the selection of comparable companies 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions  the company may be required to record impairment charges

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company  as a large international organization  faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on the company s financial results in the future 
the company s primary exposure relates to transactions in which the currency collected from customers is different from the currency utilized to purchase the product sold in europe  the asia pacific region  and latin and south america 
the company s policy is to hedge substantially all currency exposures for which natural hedges do not exist 
natural hedges exist when purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and therefore no exposure exists to hedge with a foreign exchange forward or option contract collectively  foreign exchange contracts 
in asia  for example  sales and purchases are primarily denominated in us dollars  resulting in a natural hedge 
natural hedges exist in most countries in which the company operates  although the percentage of natural offsets vs 
offsets  which need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts  will vary from country to country 
the company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
the risk of loss on a foreign exchange contract is the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties  which the company minimizes by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions 
the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is estimated using market quotes 
the notional amount of the foreign exchange contracts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amounts  which are nominal  approximated fair value at december  and the translation of the financial statements of the non north american operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
had the various average foreign currency exchange rate s remained the same during as compared with the average rates for  sales and operating income would have been approximately million and million lower  respectively  than the reported results for sales and operating income would have fluctuated by approximately million and million  respectively  if average foreign exchange rates changed by in this amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical foreign exchange rate on the sales and operating income of the company s international operations 
interest rate risk the company s interest expense  in part  is sensitive to the general level of interest rates in the americas  europe  and the asia pacific region 
the company historically has managed its exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and floating rate debt in its total debt portfolio 
in addition  the company has from time to time used interest rate swaps that convert certain fixed rate debt to floating rate debt  effectively hedging the change in fair value of the fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
as a result  at december   approximately of the company s debt was subject to fixed rates  and of its debt was subject to floating rates 
during  as a result of significant generation of operating cash flow  the company paid down nearly all of its floating rate debt 
this reduction in floating rate debt was offset  in part  by the impact of the aforementioned swaps 
as a result  at december   approximately of the company s debt was subject to fixed rates  and of its debt was subject to floating rates 
interest expense  net of interest income  would have fluctuated by approximately million if average interest rates changed by one percentage point in this amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical interest rate on the company s average floating rate on investments and outstanding debt 
this analysis does not consider the effect of the level of overall economic activity that could exist 
in the event of a change in the level of economic activity  which may adversely impact interest rates  the company could likely take actions to further mitigate any potential negative exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncerta inty of the specific actions that might be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
