vitoss scaffold synthetic cancellous bone void filler vitoss is a resorbable  beta tricalcium  phosphate scaffold used as a bone void filler in orthopaedic and spinal procedures 
the highly porous physical structure of vitoss allows it to be rapidly saturated with marrow  blood and nutrients providing the cells and signals that 
table of contents are required for bone growth and remodeling 
vitoss provides a three dimensional structure which  we believe  allows for the three dimensional regeneration of bone 
vitoss is covered by several us issued patents and other us and foreign patent applications are pending 
we received regulatory clearance for vitoss in the us from the fda in december and ce certification in the european union from our notified body in july see government regulation europe below 
the ce certification permits us to sell vitoss in all of the countries of the european union as well as in other countries  such as switzerland and israel that have adopted the european union s regulatory standards 
these regulatory approvals allow us to market vitoss for use as a cancellous bone void filler for bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system  including the extremities  spine and pelvis 
we also received regulatory approval in march to sell vitoss for this use in australia 
we commenced sales of vitoss in europe in october and in the us in march through  vitoss was available in two product configurations vitoss block and vitoss standard morsel 
in february  we began a rolling launch of two additional vitoss configurations vitoss micro morsels and vitoss macro morsels see near term product development below 
in addition  during december  we commenced sales of  on a limited basis  vitoss micro morsel canisters and vitoss standard morsel canisters 
we received regulatory clearance for vitoss scaffold foam product platform in the us from the fda under a k in december  and commenced sales of the first product configuration under the vitoss scaffold foam product platform during february these multiple product iterations are designed to provide a broader choice for our surgeon customers when utilizing vitoss in various applications 
bone defect repair 
injury or trauma to the bone  as well as degenerative conditions  disease and aging  affect the health and viability of the human skeleton 
these conditions often result in the need for the repair of bone defects through a bone grafting procedure 
approximately  bone grafting procedures on a worldwide basis are performed each year in the spine  extremities and pelvis  representing a potential market of approximately  bone grafting material is either i autograft material  which is often obtained or harvested from the iliac crest region of the patient s own hip  or ii allograft material  which is obtained from a cadaver  or iii synthetically derived materials that provide one or more components of either scaffold such as vitoss  cells or signals 
vitoss has been used in bone grafting procedures as a bone void filler to provide a synthetic scaffold in a variety of applications  including those of the long bone  extremity  spine and pelvic areas 
a harvest of autograft material involves an additional procedure that extends surgical time  adding to costs and increasing blood loss and patient risk of infection or adverse reaction from the additional time under anesthesia 
of equal concern  harvesting bone for autograft sometimes causes protracted pain that may necessitate a trip back to the surgeon several months after the surgical procedure 
using vitoss instead of autograft material avoids these potential complications of autograft harvest procedures 
as an alternative to the use of allograft material  vitoss avoids any patient and surgeon quality concerns regarding the use of cadaver derived allograft material 

table of contents spinal repair 
many patients affected by severe back pain due to degeneration of one or more discs are treated with a spinal fusion procedure 
each year approximately  spinal fusions are done on a worldwide basis 
in cases where the patient has advanced disc degeneration or spinal instability  spinal fusion involves the fusing together of adjoining vertebrae 
this procedure involves a surgical incision in the patient s back or abdomen and frequently requires the removal of the affected disc material and the surgical attachment of a metal implant  spinal fusion cage  or machined bone derived from a cadaver to provide the initial support for the two surrounding vertebrae 
the metal implant  spinal fusion cage  or machined cadaver bone is usually packed with bone grafting material to help promote the union or fusion of the two adjacent vertebrae 
as discussed above  bone grafting material is either i autograft material  ii allograft material  or iii synthetically derived materials including scaffolds such as vitoss 
for the reasons above  we believe the use of vitoss  rather than allograft or autograft materials  in spinal repair procedures is preferable to both the patient and the surgeon 
iliac crest repair 
the bone grafting material used to pack the metal implant and cages used in spinal fusion procedure is often autograft material  obtained or harvested from the iliac crest region of the patient s own hip through an operating procedure 
this procedure leaves an open space in the iliac crest  which is often painful and slow healing 
each year  autograft material is used in approximately  spinal fusion procedures worldwide and that harvested material is used in another  non spinal fusion related procedures worldwide 
vitoss can be used to repair the bone void left by the harvest procedure at the time of surgery and may reduce pain and speed healing time 
in post marketing studies of vitoss for iliac crest repair  initial results indicated the use of vitoss performs well in the formation of new bone 
vitoss also resulted in a reduction of incidence of post operative bleeding and post operative pain at the harvest site 
trauma 
physical trauma such as falls and accidents can result in bone fracture or damage 
fractures of broken bones are often realigned with hardware  such as plates  rods and screws 
once the hardware has been used to recreate the skeletal anatomy  there are often defects or voids in the bone which remain 
those voids require the use of bone graft material 
the goal of bone grafting in trauma applications is to rapidly heal the damaged bone 
approximately  trauma related bone graft repairs are performed annually on a worldwide basis 
autograft  cadaver allograft  as well as synthetic scaffolds  like vitoss  are used for trauma related bone graft repairs 
vitoss has been used as a bone void filler in a variety of trauma applications  including those of the long bone  extremity  and pelvis 
in addition  vitoss has been used to fill bone void defects due to trauma in cancelleous fractures of the wrist  ankle  tibia and femur 
hip and knee reconstruction 
in nearly of total joint reconstruction cases the reconstruction implant wears out or loosens 
the worn or loose implant often must be revised through surgery where the affected implant is removed  the bones re prepared and a new total joint device implanted 
in these total joint revision surgeries  there is usually a need for bone graft materials since the loosened and worn implant can be destructive to the local bone tissue 
vitoss has been used in conjunction with joint revision implants in many hip and knee revision surgeries 
vitoss is packed into the defect of the acetabulum and femur in hip revision surgery and in the tibia and femur in knee revision surgery 

table of contents dental  periodontal  oral and cranio maxillofacial 
in august  we entered into a supply agreement with biomimetic that allows biomimetic to use its rhpdgf in combination with our proprietary vitomatrix particulate synthetic scaffold biomaterial  which we produce in the same process used to manufacture vitoss 
under the agreement  we will supply our proprietary calcium phosphate biomaterial to biomimetic for its clinical and commercial use in conjunction with rhpdgf 
the agreement provides that  upon obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals  biomimetic will market and sell the combined product  which is currently distributed for investigational use  in the dental  periodontal  oral and cranio maxillofacial bone grafting markets 
imbibe bone marrow aspirate syringe in september  we received regulatory clearance from the fda to market imbibe for use as a bone marrow aspiration syringe in the us imbibe provides spine and orthopaedic surgeons with a simple method for harvesting a patient s own bone marrow  mixing it with vitoss and delivering the mixture to the bone graft site 
in march  we received regulatory clearance from the fda to market in the us three additional imbibe syringes which  we believe  will provide greater flexibility and options for surgeons 
near term product development in an effort to increase product revenue in the next several years  we have developed and are continuing to develop new products under our approved vitoss and imbibe product platforms 
we are seeking to bring these product line extensions to market in the us through the k regulatory process 
these product line extensions will be in addition to our long term ide clinical programs with cortoss and rhakoss see below 
during  we introduced the following new products to our product platforms vitoss scaffold micro morsels mm morsel size range provides surgeons the option to pack vitoss more tightly into voids when appropriate and the smaller size fits through minimally invasive tube sets 
we began to sell vitoss scaffold micro morsels in the us at the end of the first quarter of vitoss scaffold macro morsels mm morsel size range provides surgeons the option to fill larger voids more efficiently and rapidly 
we began to sell vitoss scaffold macro morsels in the us at the end of the first quarter of vitoss scaffold canisters functional packaging of vitoss in cc  cc  cc and cc sizes 
the canister is pre filled with either vitoss micro morsels or vitoss standard morsels and allows surgeons to directly  and in a sterile environment  combine vitoss with bone marrow aspirate in one step and to easily deliver the bone graft material during surgery 
we began to sell these canisters through a limited number of our independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives in the us at the very end of the fourth quarter of  and fully released vitoss scaffold canisters for sale in january 
table of contents imbibe syringes cc  cc and cc syringes provide surgeons with more options for combining vitoss with bone marrow aspirate in a variety of sizes 
we began to sell these additional imbibe syringe sizes in the us at the end of the first quarter of bone marrow aspiration needles bone marrow aspirate needles in various sizes  diameters and lengths allow surgeons to have broader technique options for harvesting bone marrow aspirate for combination with vitoss 
imbibe disposable funnels disposable funnels which allow surgeons to easily deliver vitoss directly into the surgical site 
we began to sell these disposable funnels in the us during the fourth quarter of we intend for the product pipeline to include vitoss scaffold foam we received regulatory clearance for the vitoss scaffold foam product platform in the us from the fda under a k in december vitoss scaffold foam combines vitoss with proprietary knsy resorbable biomaterials 
vitoss scaffold foam is a bone graft material  which is pliant and compression resistant 
vitoss scaffold foam material may be imbibed with fluids such as bone marrow aspirate  blood  or saline and is capable of holding and retaining fluids 
these properties of the vitoss scaffold foam make it suitable for use in a variety of clinical applications 
we commenced sales of vitoss scaffold foam strips  the first product configuration under the vitoss scaffold foam product platform  during february we anticipate the launch of vitoss scaffold foam cylinders during the first quarter of vitoss scaffold foam flow we received regulatory clearance for vitoss scaffold foam product platform  which includes vitoss scaffold foam flow  in the us from the fda under a k in december vitoss scaffold foam flow combines vitoss with proprietary knsy resorbable biomaterials 
vitoss scaffold foam flow  when wet as recommended with sterile fluids bone marrow  blood or saline during a surgical procedure  yields a cohesive putty like bone graft material  which is easily delivered to minimally invasive surgical sites 
vitoss scaffold foam flow may be delivered through devices  such as funnels and tubes  to accommodate a variety of surgical procedures 
we expect to launch vitoss scaffold foam flow during the second quarter of we are seeking to further expand our vitoss product portfolio during the second half of endoskeleton ta device in late december  we received k fda regulatory clearance to market our first device within our new endoskeleton product platform 
endoskeleton ta is a structural device  based on a proprietary orthovita design  to replace damaged vertebral bodies 
endoskeleton ta is designed to provide physiological support when used in conjunction with bone graft materials such as our recently cleared vitoss foam 
the 
table of contents endoskeleton ta device provides an open frame that  when combined with bone graft materials  facilitates bone healing and permits direct visualization of the graft 
we believe that this allows the surgeon to better assess the progress of healing 
the endoskeleton ta device is expected to be available through a focused commercial release by the end of the second quarter of  with full commercial availability expected later in cortoss synthetic cortical bone void filler cortoss is a high strength  bone bonding  self setting composite engineered specifically to mimic the characteristics of human cortical bone 
laboratory tests demonstrate that cortoss exhibits compressive strength similar to human cortical bone and is bioactive such that it promotes direct bony apposition 
for patients with poor bone healing capacity  as seen in osteoporotic patients  cortoss has been developed to be used in a variety of surgical procedures to provide structural stability and reinforcement of the bones after surgery 
the surgeon s goal is to repair the patient s bone and provide mobility to the patient as quickly as possible 
prolonged bed rest or inactivity often results in decreased overall health for older  osteoporotic patients 
in order to gain mobility quickly  structural stability must be provided in a short period of time 
cortoss s simple mix on demand delivery system design allows for minimum waste and maximum ease of use and flexibility for the surgeon 
cortoss is an injectable material that is delivered aseptically through a pre filled  unit dose  disposable cartridge 
delivery of cortoss to the surgical site may be started and stopped for a prolonged period of time throughout the surgical procedure 
polymerization is initiated when cortoss is expressed through the static mix tip and hardens within minutes 
cortoss provides two stages of fixation immediate mechanical interlock into porous bone  followed by intimate bone growth along the contours of the surface 
cortoss develops a calcium phosphate rich surface  which is equivalent in composition and structure to bone mineral 
six month cortoss histology pre clinical studies shows direct  intimate bony contact 
cortoss is covered by several us issued patents and other us and foreign patent applications are pending 
we received the ce certification for cortoss for use in screw augmentation procedures in october in the european union and regulatory approval in march in australia  which allow us to sell cortoss in these territories as well as in other countries that have adopted the european union s regulatory standards 
screw augmentation is a procedure for the fixation of bone screws used in patients with weak bone caused by osteoporosis 
we initiated a limited launch of cortoss in europe in december we successfully completed post marketing human clinical studies in europe for the use of cortoss in hip compression screw augmentation 
in addition  during january  we received ce certification in the european union to market cortoss for vertebral augmentation of vertebral compression fractures vcfs of the spine 
vertebral augmentation of vcfs is a procedure for repairing fractured vertebrae that can be performed on an outpatient or short stay basis 
during  we completed patient enrollment of a fda approved investigational device exemption ide pilot clinical study in the us for the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the vertebroplasty surgical technique  and upon fda review of the pilot data  we received approval from fda to begin patient enrollment of the pivotal phase of that clinical study 
also during  we began patient enrollment of a 
table of contents second fda approved ide pilot clinical study in the us for the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the kyphoplasty surgical technique 
there can be no assurance that the data from any such clinical trials will support clearance or approval from the fda to market this product for any of these uses 
cortoss is not available for commercial distribution in the us vertebral augmentation of vcfs 
there are approximately  patients worldwide with vcfs caused by osteoporotic bone or bone cancer resulting in severe pain and immobility 
of these  approximately  fractures are diagnosed 
the traditional treatments  eg  bed rest  bracing  narcotics or anesthetic injections  do not address the underlying fracture 
vertebral augmentation of vcfs has been reported to provide early pain relief in over of osteoporotic patients 
early relief of pain provided by vertebral augmentation of vcfs allows patients to maintain better functional capacity 
functional capacity  in turn  is believed to be directly related to the ability to live independently and unassisted 
we are not aware of any product that has received fda approval or ce certification for use in this procedure on the basis of controlled clinical data  however  surgeons currently use polymethylmethacrylate pmma bone cement off label which means the use of a product for a non approved indication 
we believe that cortoss is the only biomaterial in europe certified for vertebral augmentation of vcfs injections based on prospective clinical studies 
in addition  cortoss may have several advantages over pmma in vertebral augmentation of vcfs  such as its ability to be seen by surgeons without adding additional materials such as barium when using imaging equipment in performing the procedure  its lower temperature setting that reduces the risk of tissue necrosis associated with pmma  its higher compression strength and more natural elasticity and its ability to be mixed on demand 
in addition  cortoss does not release free unreacted monomers into the patient s body like pmma 
monomer release has been shown to cause a variety of cardiopulmonary complications such as hypotension and emboli 
european clinical study 
in july  we completed patient enrollment in a multi center prospective clinical study using cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs in europe 
a total of patients  including both osteoporotic vcfs and cancerous vcfs  were enrolled and over vertebral levels were treated 
monitoring was conducted pre operatively  and post operative follow up was completed at the end of one day  four days  eight days  one month  three months and six months 
the study results indicated that one month after treatment with cortoss  visual analog pain scores were reduced on average by 
this clinical study data was submitted and resulted in our receiving the ce mark in europe for cortoss for vertebral augmentation of vcfs 
systematic approach to cortoss in vcfs 
we are pursuing a systematic approach to studying cortoss for use in vertebral augmentation of vcfs and to gain fda approval 
first  we completed the above mentioned multi center prospective clinical study in europe 
next in may  we completed patient enrollment in a us pilot clinical study under an fda ide for vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the vertebroplasty surgical technique 
the us pilot clinical study utilized our aliquot microdelivery system to inject cortoss directly into the fractured vertebrae 
thirdly  we received fda approval  and have begun patient enrollment in a second pilot study using cortoss for vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the kyphoplasty surgical technique 
with the kyphoplasty surgical technique  
table of contents the fractured vertebral body is tamped and reduced on the inside of the vertebral body using disposable instrumentation  such as a balloon  prior to the injection of cortoss into the vertebral body 
the fourth and final step in our systematic approach for approval of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the vertebroplasty surgical technique will be to enroll patients in the fda approved pivotal clinical study  which will study the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs 
the pivotal study design includes a control group for comparison 
screw augmentation 
worldwide each year  approximately  orthopaedic procedures are performed using internal fixation devices that involve screws 
about  of these involve long bone fractures that are treated with metal plates and screws and the remainder of these procedures involve hip fractures treated with compression screws and spinal fractures treated with pedicle screws 
long bone screw augmentation 
in long bone fractures  screws are placed into the plate and serve to compress the fracture  permitting faster healing 
these screws strip or fail to hold in approximately  osteoporotic patients each year due to poor bone quality  as is often the case in osteoporotic bone 
where screws fail to hold  current treatment options include i replacement of the screw with a screw of larger diameter  which may further weaken the bone and is not always possible because of the size of the screw holes and or the bone  ii replacing the plate with a longer plate with more screw holes to span the failed screw holes  which adds considerable time to the procedure  creates a larger wound area  increases the risk of other screws failing due to their removal and reimplantation  and in certain situations is anatomically not possible  iii leaving the plate with the failed screws as it is and giving the patient a non load bearing cast for a prolonged period of time  which increases the risk of post operative complications related to immobilization  such as deep venous thrombosis  or iv augmenting the screws with pmma bone cement  which is cumbersome and time consuming because it needs to be manually mixed and transferred into a syringe for application and  after mixing there only is a small time window in which it can be used before it sets  making it difficult to augment more than one screw at a time 
additionally  pmma bone cement is not approved in europe or approved in the us by the fda for this indication 
the use of cortoss to anchor the screw in a quick and efficient way will allow the full function of the screw to be restored 
we are not aware of any cement products that have received fda approval or ce certification that would be in competition with cortoss for this indication 
a patient multi center clinical study in europe of patients undergoing surgery to repair bone fractures demonstrated that cortoss allowed the successful use of metal screws in the repair procedures despite patients poor bone quality 
the three month study showed cortoss restored the holding power of percent of previously failed bone screws  permitting the use of a plate to stabilize the fracture and healing in all patients with no adverse events related to cortoss reported 
pedicle screw augmentation 
many spinal surgeries today have become possible only due to the availability of instrumentation systems that allow manipulation and fixation of the individual elements of the spine 
these instrumentation systems are attached to the spine by means of screws placed in the pedicle region of the vertebrae 
in patients with sub optimal 
table of contents bone quality  such as osteoporotic patients  the purchase or bite of these screws may be insufficient to maintain the integrity of the construction 
there are approximately  patients in which pedicle screws are placed each year on a worldwide basis 
approximately  may require the augmentation of screws due to osteoporosis 
we believe cortoss has the potential to ensure secure fixation of the screws  allowing the instrumentation systems to restore maximum fixation and stabilize the spine 
additionally  we believe cortoss s mix on demand delivery system makes its use here convenient and practical 
we are not aware of any products approved for this indication that would be in competition with cortoss 
compression screw augmentation 
approximately  hip fractures occur annually worldwide of which an estimated  are repaired using compression screw augmentation 
many osteoporotic patients  particularly elderly women  suffer a fracture of the hip whereby the ball of the hip and socket  or the head of the femur leg bone  is separated from the rest of the bone 
these fractures are often treated through the use of compression hip screws  which are placed through the femur bone and into the femoral head to stabilize and compress the fracture to permit healing 
the healing of a fracture is directly proportional to the degree of stabilization 
the failure of screws to purchase or hold is common  especially in osteoporotic bone 
additionally  in many cases  even after the screw gains initial hold  the screw s sharp thread edges may cause the screw to cut through the bone and walk out through the femoral head 
such a failure during or after the surgical procedure will result in the need for an artificial hip implant 
we believe the use of cortoss to anchor the screw in a quick and efficient way will allow the full function of the screw to be restored 
we are not aware of any products approved for this indication that would be in competition with cortoss 
in two separate clinical studies in europe  cortoss was used to increase the holding power of screws in the bone and to protect the bone from the screw s sharp threads 
the first study included patients with subtrochanteric fractures  which had been treated with dynamic hip screws and was completed during early the holding power of the screw was shown to increase significantly in all patients 
this holding power was evidenced by an increase in torque resistance 
to date  none of the augmented screws has shown movement 
a second clinical study was successfully completed  which included patients with intra capsular fractures of the hip  and evaluated the effect of cortoss for the augmentation of two parallel screws used to reduce and fix the hip fracture 
the use of cortoss for this indication has the potential to reduce the need for a second corrective surgery 
aliquot microdelivery system our aliquot microdelivery system facilitates effective delivery of our cortoss product directly to the surgical site 
a two part system of catheter and syringe dispenser is designed to assure effective delivery of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs and screw augmentation procedures 
during the second quarter of  we received ce certification from our notified body for aliquot 
the aliquot system was used as part of our european multi center prospective clinical study for cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs and is being used in the us studies for cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs 
aliquot is covered by us issued patents 

table of contents rhakoss synthetic bone spinal implants rhakoss is under development in europe as a preformed composite  providing high strength while also allowing the ingrowth of host bone to address the spine repair needs of the vertebral interbody fusion and spinal reconstruction market 
rhakoss is manufactured using our proprietary orthobone bioactive composite technology 
rhakoss can be manufactured into any size or shape to optimize anatomic fit 
rhakoss can be injection molded or machined  thus generating a potentially unlimited supply and consistent material performance 
we believe that  if regulatory approval is obtained  rhakoss may represent a potential alternative to titanium carbon fiber cages and allograft cadaver bone implants 
we are developing rhakoss to combine the best features of first generation interbody fusion devices while eliminating many of the disadvantages of some currently available materials  such as inconsistent structural integrity  inability to visualize the graft material  potential concerns about disease transmission and potential limited supply 
rhakoss is designed to mimic the radiolucency of bone  which means its transparency to x ray and other radiation  as well as the strength and flexibility characteristics of bone 
we have completed patient enrollment for the pivotal phase of our rhakoss clinical study in europe for patients undergoing cervical spinal fusion surgery 
more than patients have been enrolled and we will follow each patient for months 
based upon month follow up clinical data  a ce mark application was filed with our notified body in december there can be no assurances that the data from any such clinical trials will result in obtaining the ce certification necessary to sell rhakoss in the european union 
in the us during  we filed an ide with the fda seeking approval to initiate human clinical studies for the use of rhakoss in cervical spinal fusion 
the fda has requested one year clinical data from our european pivotal clinical study prior to the completion of their review of our ide filing 
we expect one year data to be available during the third quarter of spinal fusion 
the current worldwide market estimate for interbody fusion devices including titanium cages  carbon fiber cages and cadaver bone dowels and spacers is approximately  we believe rhakoss potentially offers the surgeon and patient the consistency of engineered synthetics  with similar characteristics to those of human bone implants 
our research development we employ a multidisciplinary approach to create biomaterials technology platforms  including composite engineering  polymer science  solution chemistry and nanoparticulate ceramic glass science to create novel biomaterials 
we then use the new biomaterials to develop unique  synthetic  biologically active products engineered to restore the human skeleton 
patents have been issued and additional patent applications have been filed to protect our key biomaterial developments

manufacturing and product supply the manufacture of our products is subject to regulation and periodic inspection by various regulatory bodies for compliance with current good manufacturing practice gmp regulations  quality system regulation qsr  requirements  international standards organization iso series standards and equivalent requirements 
our  square foot vitoss and cortoss manufacturing facilities which produce our commercial products  are leased through july and are certified as meeting the requirements of iso and european norm en for the period july  through july  these facilities are subject to inspection by the fda for compliance with fda device manufacture requirements 
the most recent fda inspection resulted with no corrective actions being required 
in addition to the need for cortoss us regulatory approval  in order to commercialize cortoss in the us  the cortoss manufacturing facility and quality assurance system must pass inspection by the fda 
we believe our manufacturing facility has the capacity to meet our commercial needs for the next several years 
we are manufacturing vitoss canisters  imbibe  endoskeleton ta  and aliquot through outside third party contract manufacturers 
our vitoss is converted to vitoss scaffold foam by knsy  our development partner 
our third party manufacturers are iso certified or have been audited by us and determined to meet our quality system requirements see government regulation below 
our ability to manufacture vitoss and cortoss is dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
we do not have any long term supply agreements 
table of contents for raw materials 
the failure of a supplier to continue to provide us with these materials at a price or quality acceptable to us  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture these products 
moreover  our failure to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single sourced material used to manufacture vitoss  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with paul capital royalty acquisition fund  lp sales and marketing we have assembled a field sales network of independent sales agencies in the us in order to market vitoss and imbibe 
in addition  we continue to strengthen our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us sales territories where either we do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territories are under served 
our direct sales representatives work alone and or in conjunction with our independent sales agencies 
we intend to utilize our current field sales network to market endoskeleton ta in the us outside of the us  we utilize a network of independent stocking distributors to market vitoss  cortoss  and aliquot 
the independent distributors outside of the us and the end user customers in the us do not have the right to return or exchange any products that they have purchased from us 
the time between receipt of orders and shipment is generally short  and as a result  backlog is not significant 
competition extensive research efforts and rapid technological change characterize the market for products in the orthopaedic market 
we face intense competition from medical device  biomedical technology  and medical products companies 
our products could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete by competitors technological advances 
we may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products 
moreover  many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution  manufacturing and technological resources than us and as a result may adversely impact our influence over the distribution channels for our products 
these competitors may also be in the process of seeking fda or other regulatory approvals  or patent protection  for new products 
our competitors could  therefore  commercialize new competing products in advance of our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe vitoss faces competition from products currently on the market as well as products that may enter the market in the future 
our share of the bone graft market is not significant due to the fact that our two commercial products have been commercially available for approximately three years  and we have only recently begun to expand our product configurations under our vitoss platform 
vitoss was approved in the us in december and launched in march cortoss  which was approved in europe during the fourth quarter of for screw augmentation and in the 
table of contents first quarter of for vertebral augmentation of vcfs  has had limited european sales to date 
moreover  we do not expect cortoss to receive approval in the us for at least several years  if at all 
the companies against whom we currently compete are different than those that we had  at the time of product launch  expected to be our primary competitors 
this is indicative of the dynamic market in which we operate 
during  the bone graft market saw the introduction of synthetic recombinant signaling growth factors  also known as bone morphogenic proteins bmps  into the synthetic segment of the marketplace 
bmps are growth factors that are believed to significantly accelerate the healing mechanism of bone 
we believe the healing mechanism of bone is dependent upon the presence of all three of the following components i signaling molecules  either provided by the patient or commercially provided such as with bmps  ii the patient s own stem cells or osteoprogenitor cells  and iii scaffold or bone graft material  either provided by the patient or commercially provided  such as by vitoss 
we expect the introduction of bmps to expand the overall bone graft market and in particular the synthetic segment of the bone graft market 
however  it is too early for us to determine whether the market will place greater emphasis on the signaling molecule component i above over the other two components ii and iii above to the healing mechanism of bone 
we believe that several factors mitigate against the broad use of bmps  including i concern over bmps causing excess bone growth in unwanted areas  and ii the current high cost of bmps in comparison to commercial bone graft materials and to vitoss in particular 
moreover  due to the high cost of bmps and the potential to cause excessive bone growth  surgeons may prefer using only a small volume of bmps in relation to the anatomic site where new bone growth is sought 
vitoss can be used in conjunction with  and complementary to  bmps in applications where vitoss can provide the volume of scaffold necessary to fill the defect site 
accordingly  we have developed a two pronged marketing strategy that provides the option for surgeons to choose to use vitoss either instead of  or concurrently with  the bmps depending upon the surgical procedure and the patient s physiological profile 
additionally  now that bmps have been on the market for almost two years  it is generally believed that better carriers or scaffolds must be developed to expand clinical usage and utility of bmps 
we believe our vitoss and vitoss scaffold foam products may be used for this indication 
we do not know of any products that have received fda approval or a ce certification for screw augmentation and or vertebral augmentation of vcfs that would be in competition with cortoss for these indications  however  we may face off label use of pmma bone cement products 
rhakoss  if approved  will compete against established products in the market place  including those manufactured from metal carbon fiber and cadaver bone 
government regulation in order to market our products  we must apply for  be granted and maintain all necessary regulatory approvals and comply with all regulatory requirements in each applicable jurisdiction 
to date  we have received regulatory clearance for vitoss in the us from the fda under a k see below in december and the ce certification in the european union from our notified body in july in march  we also received regulatory approval to sell vitoss in australia 
the ce certification permits us to sell our approved 
table of contents products in all of the countries of the european union as well as in other countries  such as switzerland and israel  that have adopted the european union s regulatory standards 
we received regulatory clearance for vitoss scaffold canisters and vitoss scaffold foam in november and december  respectively  in the us from the fda under a k 
product sales for vitoss scaffold canisters and vitoss scaffold foam began in late december and february  respectively 
in september  we received regulatory clearance in the us from the fda under a k to market our imbibe product for use as a bone marrow aspiration syringe 
we received ce certification for cortoss in october in the european union and regulatory approval in march in australia  which allows us to sell cortoss in these territories for use in securing screws in patients with weak bone caused by osteoporosis 
in addition  during january our ce certification was extended to enable us to market cortoss in the european union for vertebral augmentation of vcfs  including compression fractures of the spine caused by osteoporosis and invasive tumors 
during the second quarter of  we received ce certification from our notified body for aliquot 
during july  we completed patient enrollment in an fda ide approved pilot clinical study in the us for the use of cortoss for vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the vertebroplasty surgical technique  and during november we received approval from the fda to begin the pivotal phase of this study 
also during  we began patient enrollment of a second fda approved ide pilot clinical study in the us for the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the kyphoplasty surgical technique 
there can be no assurance that the data from any such clinical trials will support fda clearance or approval to market this product for these uses see manufacturing and product supply above 
in december  we received k regulatory clearance for our endoskeleton ta product platform in the us from the fda 
united states the medical devices that we manufacture and market  or intend to market  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act ffd c act and the regulations promulgated thereunder  the fda regulates the clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals clearances and criminal prosecution 
in the us  medical devices are classified into one of three classes class i  ii or iii on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the fda to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness 
under fda regulations  class i devices  the least regulated category  are subject to general controls and class ii devices are subject to general and special controls 
generally  class iii devices are those that must receive premarket approval by the fda to ensure their safety and effectiveness 

table of contents before we can introduce a new device into the market  we must generally obtain market clearance through a k notification or premarket approval through a premarket approval application pma 
a k clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or ii medical device  or to a class iii medical device for which the fda has not called for a pma 
the fda may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  or that additional information or data are needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made 
a request for additional data may require that clinical studies be performed to establish the device s substantial equivalence 
commercial distribution of a device for which a k notification is required can begin only after the fda issues an order finding the device to be substantially equivalent to a predicate device 
pursuant to the ffd c act  the fda must make a determination with respect to a k submission within days of its receipt 
the fda may  and often does  extend this time frame by requesting additional data or information 
a not substantially equivalent determination  or a request for additional information  could delay or prevent the market introduction of new products for which we file such notifications 
for any of our products that are cleared through the k process  modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require new k submissions 
the fda has implemented a policy under which certain device modifications may be submitted as a special k  which will require only a day review 
special k s are limited to those device modifications that do not affect the intended use or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device and for which substantial equivalence can be demonstrated through design controls 
we must file a pma if our proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii device  or if it is a class iii device for which fda has called for pma 
a pma must be supported by valid scientific evidence that typically includes extensive data  including pre clinical and clinical trial data  to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device  as well as extensive manufacturing information 
fda review of a pma generally takes one to two years from the date the pma is accepted for filing  but may take significantly longer 
the review time is often significantly extended should the fda ask for more information or clarification of information already provided in the submission 
during the pma review period  an advisory committee  typically a panel of clinicians  will likely be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to whether the device should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory panel 
toward the end of the pma review process  the fda generally will conduct an inspection of the manufacturer s facilities to ensure that they are in compliance with applicable good manufacturing practices  or quality system requirements 
if the fda s evaluations of both the pma and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter  which usually contains a 
table of contents number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the pma 
when  and if  those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the fda  the agency will issue an approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications 
if the fda s evaluation of the pma or manufacturing facilities is not favorable  the fda will deny approval of the pma or issue a not approvable letter 
the fda may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary  in which case pma approval may be delayed up to several years while we conduct additional clinical trials and submit an amendment to the pma 
the pma process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy  and a number of devices for which other companies have sought fda approval have never been approved for marketing 
modifications to a device that is the subject of an approved pma including modifications to its labeling or manufacturing process may require approval by the fda of pma supplements or new pmas 
supplements to a pma often require the submission of the same type of information required for an initial pma  except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original pma 
if clinical trials of a device are required in connection with either a k notification or a pma and the device presents a significant risk  we will be required to file an ide application prior to commencing clinical trials 
the ide application must be supported by data  typically including the results of animal and laboratory testing 
if the ide application is reviewed and approved by the fda and one or more appropriate institutional review boards irbs  clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients  as approved by the fda 
if the device presents a non significant risk to the patient  we may begin the clinical trials after obtaining approval for the study by one or more appropriate irbs  but not the fda 
for significant risk devices  we must submit an ide supplement to the fda and receive approval from the fda before we  or our investigator  may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness or the rights  safety or welfare of human subjects 
irb approval may be required for changes in the investigational plan for both non significant risk and significant risk devices 
any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda clearances or approvals are subject to extensive regulation by the fda  including reporting and record keeping requirements 
device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and certain state agencies 
the most recent fda inspection resulted with no corrective actions being required 
the ffd c act requires devices to be manufactured in accordance with qsr requirements that impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities 
medical devices are also subject to post market reporting requirements for deaths or serious injuries when the device may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury  and for certain device malfunctions that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
if safety or efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market  the fda may impose severe limitations on the use of any approved or cleared product 

table of contents our labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved or uncleared uses 
we  as well as our products  are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products are or will be marketed 
any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities 
we are also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business 
we are currently manufacturing vitoss and cortoss in the us  distributing vitoss and imbibe in the us and distributing vitoss  cortoss and aliquot outside the us we are manufacturing vitoss canisters  imbibe  endoskeleton ta  and aliquot in the us through outside third party contract manufacturers 
our vitoss is converted to vitoss scaffold foam by knsy  our development partner 
vitoss  as well as any other products that we manufacture or distribute following their approval or clearance by the fda  will be subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
if safety and efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market  the fda may impose severe limitations on the use of any approved or cleared product 
moreover  modifications to the approved or cleared product may require the submission of a new pma or a pma supplement  or a new k notification 
we may not be successful in obtaining the approval or clearance of any new pma  necessary pma supplements  or new k notifications in a timely manner  if at all 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals clearances and criminal prosecution 
europe in order to sell our products within the european union  we are required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the european union medical devices directive the mdd and affix a ce certification on our products to attest such compliance 
to achieve this  our products must meet the essential requirements defined under the mdd relating to safety and performance and we must successfully undergo a verification of our regulatory compliance conformity assessment by an independent notified body 
the nature of the conformity assessment will depend on the regulatory class of our products 
under european law  our products  other than imbibe and aliquot  are likely to be in class iii 
in the case of class iii products  we must as a result of the regulatory structure which we have elected to follow establish and maintain a complete quality system for design and manufacture as described in annex ii of the mdd and demonstrated by compliance with the iso and en standards for 
we are certified as meeting the requirements of iso and en for the period july  through july  our notified body has audited our quality system and determined that it meets the requirements of the mdd 
in 
table of contents addition  the notified body must approve the specific design of each device in class iii and iia 
as part of the design approval process  the notified body must also verify that the products comply with the essential requirements of the mdd 
in order to comply with these requirements  we must  among other things  complete a risk analysis and may be required to present clinical data 
the clinical data presented by us must provide evidence that the products meet the performance specifications claimed by us  provide sufficient evidence of adequate assessment of unwanted side effects and demonstrate that the benefits to the patient outweigh the risks associated with the device 
we will be subject to continued surveillance by the notified body and will be required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities 
we also will be required to comply with additional national requirements that are beyond the scope of the mdd 
japan in order to market our products in japan  we must obtain the approval of the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare 
we will need to conduct clinical trials for vitoss and cortoss in japan to obtain approval there for those two products 
accordingly  we will need to enter into a third party strategic alliance to conduct such clinical trials  obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and market vitoss and cortoss in japan 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in achieving such an alliance or that we will ultimately obtain the approvals necessary to market our products in japan 
third party reimbursement successful sales of our products in the us and other markets will depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payers relative to our products 
in the us  health care providers  such as hospitals and physicians that purchase or utilize our products for treatment of their patients  generally rely on independent third party payers  such as private insurance companies or hmos  and governmental payers  such as medicare and medicaid to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the provision of items and services using our products 
physicians  hospitals  and other health care providers may not purchase our products if they do not receive satisfactory reimbursement from these payers for the cost of procedures using our products 
each payer has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product 
private payers often rely on the lead of the governmental payers in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations 
therefore  achieving favorable medicare coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product 
medicare is a federally funded program managed by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers  that administers coverage and reimbursement for certain health care items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled 
medicaid is an insurance program for the poor that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state 
the federal government sets general guidelines for medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern their individual program 
medicare provides  among other things  health care benefits that cover  within prescribed limits  the major costs of most medically necessary care for such individuals  subject to 
table of contents certain deductibles and co payments 
the medicare program has established  and continues to establish  standards and guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of certain procedures  equipment  supplies and other items and services 
generally  in order to be covered and reimbursed by medicare  a health care item or service furnished to a medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part 
the methodology for determining the coverage status of our products  and the amount of medicare reimbursement for our products  varies based upon  among other factors  the setting in which a medicare beneficiary received health care items and services 
acute care hospitals are generally reimbursed by medicare for inpatient operating costs based upon prospectively determined rates 
under the prospective payment system pps  acute care hospitals receive a predetermined payment rate based upon the diagnosis related group  or drg  into which each medicare beneficiary stay is assigned  regardless of the actual cost of the services provided 
certain additional or outlier payments may be made to a hospital for cases involving unusually high costs 
accordingly  acute care hospitals generally do not receive direct medicare reimbursement under pps for the distinct costs incurred in purchasing the company s products 
rather  reimbursement for these costs is deemed to be included within the drg based payments made to hospitals for the services furnished to medicare eligible inpatients in which our products are utilized 
because pps payments are based on predetermined rates and are often less than a hospital s actual costs in furnishing care  acute care hospitals have incentives to lower their inpatient operating costs by utilizing equipment  devices and supplies  including those sold by us  that will reduce the length of inpatient stays  decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs 
our product revenue could be affected negatively if acute care hospitals discontinue product use due to insufficient reimbursement  or if other treatment options are perceived to be more profitable 
medicare also reimburses most outpatient services based on a prospective or predetermined fee schedule basis  subject to certain exceptions and limitations 
similarly  some states reimburse certain health care providers for inpatient services under their medicaid programs by using prospective rates for diagnosis related groups of illnesses 
therefore  health care providers may refuse to use our products if coverage or reimbursement is inadequate 
also  any changes in federal legislation  regulations and policy affecting medicare coverage and reimbursement relative to our products could have a material effect on our performance 
inadequate coverage or reimbursement by private insurance companies and government programs could significantly reduce usage of our products 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the us has placed  and we believe will continue to place  greater pressure on medical device pricing 
such pressures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products and to raise capital 
failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain favorable coverage or reimbursement from third party payers or changes in governmental and private third party payers policies toward coverage or reimbursement for procedures employing our products would reduce demand for our products 
member countries of the european union operate various combinations of centrally financed health care systems and private health insurance systems 
the relative importance of government and private systems varies from country to country 
the choice of devices is 
table of contents subject to constraints imposed by the availability of funds within the purchasing institution 
medical devices are most commonly sold to hospitals or health care facilities at a price set by negotiation between the buyer and the seller 
a contract to purchase products may result from an individual initiative or as a result of a competitive bidding process 
in either case  the purchaser pays the supplier  and payment terms vary widely throughout the european union 
failure to obtain favorable negotiated prices with hospitals or health care facilities could adversely affect sales of our products 
product liability and insurance we manufacture medical devices used on patients in surgery  and we may be subject to product liability lawsuits 
while we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  there can be no assurance that product liability claims will not be asserted against us 
under certain of our agreements with our distributors and agencies  we indemnify the distributor or agency from product liability claims 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of policy limits 
we maintain product liability insurance in the annual aggregate amount of up to  although our insurance policies have various exclusions 
thus  we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage  in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award

overview and general development of our business we utilize proprietary technologies applied to the development of biostructures  which are synthetic biologically active tissue engineering products for restoration of the human skeleton 
our focus is on developing products primarily for use in spine surgery and in the repair of osteoporotic fractures 
we are also addressing a broad range of clinical needs in the orthopaedic market 
we incorporated in and have developed or launched several product platforms vitoss scaffold synthetic cancellous bone void filler approved in european union in july and fda approved in december imbibe bone marrow aspirate syringe used with vitoss fda approved in september endoskeleton ta device fda approved in december cortoss synthetic cortical bone void filler approved in european union in october aliquot microdelivery system used with cortoss approved in european union in second quarter of we do not expect to receive fda approval for the sale of cortoss in the us for the next several years  if at all 
accordingly  we expect to focus our efforts on sales growth under our vitoss product platform for the next several years through the extension of our vitoss product line configurations 
if the fda does not clear additional new product line configurations under the k regulatory process  we may not generate cash flow in excess of operating expenses for the foreseeable future  if at all 
until such sales levels are achieved  if ever  we expect to continue to use cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund operating activities 
we derive approximately of our revenues primarily from vitoss and imbibe product sales in the us the remaining of our revenues are derived from the vitoss  cortoss and aliquot product sales outside of the us approximately of our total product sales of  for relate to the sale of vitoss 
we have assembled a field sales network of independent sales agencies in the us in order to market vitoss and imbibe 
in addition  we continue to strengthen our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us sales territories where either we do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territories are under served 
our direct sales representatives work alone and or in conjunction with our independent sales agencies 
we intend to utilize our current field sales network to market endoskeleton ta in the us outside of the us  we utilize a network of independent stocking distributors to market vitoss  cortoss  and aliquot 

table of contents to enhance our near term product development efforts  in march  we entered into an agreement with kensey nash corporation knsy to jointly develop and commercialize new biomaterials based products 
the new products to be developed under this agreement will be based on our proprietary vitoss scaffold bone void filler material in combination with proprietary resorbable knsy biomaterials 
following the approval  if any  of a new product under the agreement  we will have obligations to pay knsy for manufacturing the product  achieve minimum sales levels for such approved product  and make royalty payments to knsy based on the net sales of such product 
in december  we received fda k clearance for the first jointly developed product  vitoss scaffold foam  and we commenced sales of the first product configuration under the vitoss scaffold foam product platform during february we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  as of december   will be sufficient to meet our currently estimated operating and investing requirements into during the year ended december   we sold  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for net proceeds of  in january  a shelf registration was filed with the sec that is expected to allow us to raise additional capital as needed 
therefore  we may seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  or strategic alliances with third parties either alone or in combination with equity 
for  our goal is for product sales to increase by approximately to  reflecting the full launch of vitoss scaffold canister and additional product configurations under our vitoss scaffold foam platform 
in addition to our network of independent sales agencies in the us  we intend to augment our current direct sales team by doubling the number of direct sales representatives in the first half of  to fully support the launch of these new products 
as a result  the net quarterly loss for is expected to remain relatively steady over the next several quarters in comparison to the fourth quarter of as we make the required investments in our business infrastructure for future growth 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable and inventories 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in the us  product sales revenue is recognized upon shipment of our product to the end user customer 
outside the us  revenue from product sales is recognized upon receipt of our product by our independent stocking distributors 
we do not allow product returns or exchanges and we have no post shipment obligations to our customers 
both our us customers and our independent stocking distributor customers outside of the us are generally required to pay on a net day basis and sales discounts are not offered 
revenue is not recognized until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for an estimated amount of losses that may result from a customer s inability to pay for product purchased 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value using the first in first out basis  or fifo 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  the costs of producing inventory in the reporting periods prior to the receipt of regulatory approval or clearance is recorded as research and development expense 
we maintain an inventory reserve allowance for an estimated amount of inventory  which may expire prior to its sale 

table of contents revenue interest obligation during october  we completed a  product development and equity financing with paul capital royalty acquisition fund  lp paul royalty 
in this financing  we sold paul royalty a revenue interest  in our vitoss  cortoss and rhakoss products  in north america and europe  and  shares of our common stock 
the value of these shares at the time the transaction closed was per share  or  in the aggregate 
the net proceeds from the financing were first allocated to the fair value of the common stock on the date of the transaction  and the  remainder of the net proceeds was allocated to the revenue interest obligation 
on march   we amended the original financing  which resulted in a one time increase to the revenue interest obligation of  which made the balance of the revenue interest obligation  as of december  and pursuant to the march amendment  paul royalty surrendered to us  shares of our common stock that it had originally purchased in the october financing 
in exchange  we surrendered our right to receive credits against the revenue interest obligation 
the value of the surrendered shares of our common stock on march  was per share  or  in the aggregate 
the march amendment also provided for a reduction in the amount required for us to repurchase paul royalty s revenue interest  if a repurchase event was to occur see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this modification was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction with a decrease to shareholders equity and an increase to the revenue interest obligation based upon the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the modification 
since this represents a non monetary transaction  we utilized the fair market value of our common stock surrendered by paul royalty on march   or  to determine the fair value of the non monetary consideration 
this approach is in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the treasury stock was then retired in september the products that are subject to the revenue interest have been approved and marketed for less than three years or are still under development 
for these reasons  as of december  and for the foreseeable future  we cannot make a reasonable estimate of future revenues and payments that may become due to paul royalty under this financing 
therefore  it is premature to estimate the expected impact of this financing on our results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
future sales from vitoss in the us and vitoss and cortoss in europe  our approved products  are difficult to estimate 
rhakoss is under development with human clinical trials initiated in europe in april we have initiated two pilot clinical studies and one pivotal human clinical trial for cortoss in the us there is no assurance that the data from these clinical trials will result in obtaining the necessary approval to sell cortoss in the us or rhakoss in europe 
even if such approval is obtained  future revenue levels  if any  are difficult to estimate 
we have not started any human clinical trials necessary to obtain fda approval to market rhakoss in the us accordingly  given the matters discussed above we have charged and  for the foreseeable future  we will continue to charge any payments made under the agreement to revenue interest expense as revenues subject to the revenue interest obligation are recognized 
we will continue to monitor our product sales levels 
once we are able to make a reasonable estimate of our related revenue interest obligation  interest expense will be charged based upon the interest method and the obligation will be reduced as principal payments are made 
revenue interest expense of   and  has been recorded for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the revenue interest under this agreement is treated as interest expense in accordance with emerging issues task force issues no 
 sales of future revenues 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with an asset and liability approach requiring the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded without consideration as to their realizability 
the deferred tax asset includes net operating loss carryforwards  and the cumulative temporary differences related to certain research and patent costs  which have been charged to expense in our consolidated statements of operations but have been recorded as assets for tax return purposes 
these tax assets are amortized over periods generally ranging from to years for tax purposes 
the portion of any deferred tax asset  for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized  must then be offset by recording a valuation allowance against the asset 
a valuation allowance has been established against all of our deferred tax assets since  given our history of operating losses  the realization of the deferred tax asset is not assured 
accounting for stock options issued to employees and non employees we apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
and related interpretations to account for our stock option plans

operating cash inflows for were likewise derived primarily from vitoss and imbibe product sales in the us and from vitoss and cortoss product sales outside the us we also received cash inflows from interest income on cash equivalents and short term investments 
operating cash outflows our operating cash outflows for have primarily been used for the production of inventory  additional investments made in strengthening our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us sales territories where either we do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territory is under served in order to support the growth of us product sales and the increased commissions paid to the independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives in the us as a result of higher product sales 
in addition  funds have been used for development and pre clinical and clinical activities in preparation for regulatory filings of our products in development 
additionally for the year ended december   we paid a contractually required advance payment of  to paul royalty 
of the  paid to paul royalty   was earned during and the balance of  was included in prepaid revenue interest expense on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  in comparison  our operating cash outflows for were primarily used for development  manufacturing scale up qualification  pre clinical and clinical activities in preparation for regulatory filings of our products in development 
in addition  funds were used for the production of inventory  increase in sales and marketing staffing  development of marketing materials and payment of sales commissions related to the commercialization of vitoss and cortoss products 

table of contents operating cash flow requirements outlook we do not expect to receive fda approval for the sale of cortoss and rhakoss in the us for the next several years  if at all 
accordingly  we expect to focus our efforts on sales growth under our vitoss product line for the next several years through the extension of our vitoss product line configurations  collection and publication of vitoss post clinical data for marketing and sales purposes  and improvements to our distribution channels 
in addition  in an effort to further accelerate the growth of sales in future quarters  we are continually investing in our field sales network by adding direct sales representatives to our organization for those territories in the us where we either do not currently have independent sales agency coverage or the territory is under served 
our efforts to grow sales and reduce our losses are heavily dependent upon the timing of receipt of fda k clearance for new product line configurations  the timing of subsequent launch and acceptance of our new product line configurations  such as vitoss scaffold foam and vitoss scaffold foam flow  the rate at which we add new direct sales representatives and the rate at which our field sales network generates sales in their respective territories 
any efforts to grow sales are subject to certain risks related to our business  which are described in this form k for the year ended december  under the caption certain risks related to our business 
if the fda does not clear additional new product line configurations under the k regulatory process  we do not expect sales to generate cash flow in excess of operating expenses for the foreseeable future  if at all 
until such sales levels are achieved  if ever  we expect to continue to use cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund operating activities 
there may be future quarterly fluctuations in spending 
we expect increases in the use of cash to build inventory for the launch of several vitoss product line configurations and for the endoskeleton ta platform 
prior to the launch of each new product line configuration  significant inventory levels must be manufactured 
the inventory will be manufactured in anticipation of the receipt of regulatory clearance  so as to prepare for rapid commercial launch of the product  once cleared  to our network of independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives 
if the inventory is built in the reporting periods prior to the receipt of the required regulatory clearance  the cost of the inventory manufactured will be expensed in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for research and development costs 
the gross margins for the new vitoss product line configurations are expected to be slightly lower than that for the current vitoss product line 
we also expect to continue to use cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during and in operating activities associated with research and development  including product development for our vitoss product line configurations and the endoskeleton ta platform  clinical trials in the us for cortoss  marketing activities in support of our other products under development and the associated marketing and sales activities with vitoss and imbibe in the us and vitoss  cortoss and aliquot outside the us during november  the pivotal clinical study for the study of cortoss in vertebral compression fractures was approved by the fda  therefore  we will incur costs associated with patient enrollment for this pivotal study in and in europe  we began selling vitoss in the fourth quarter of  cortoss for screw augmentation procedures in the fourth quarter of  aliquot in the third quarter of and cortoss for vertebral augmentation of vcf procedures in the first quarter of in the us  we began selling vitoss in the first quarter of and imbibe in 
table of contents the third quarter of in the us during the second quarter of  we began to sell the first product line extensions  vitoss micro morsels and vitoss macro morsels under the vitoss platform 
in december  we also began selling vitoss micro morsel canisters and vitoss standard morsel canisters  and in february  we began selling the first product configurations under the vitoss scaffold foam product platform 
future cash flow levels from vitoss  cortoss  imbibe and aliquot product sales are difficult to predict  and product sales to date may not be indicative of future sales levels 
vitoss  cortoss and aliquot sales levels in europe may fluctuate due to the timing of any distributor stocking orders and may experience seasonal slowdowns during the summer months 
sales of vitoss and imbibe in the us may fluctuate due to the timing of orders from hospitals 
we have entered into and may enter additional financing arrangements where we pay revenue sharing amounts on the sales of certain products 
revenue sharing arrangements can increase expenses related to the sale of our products 
in march  we entered into an agreement with knsy to jointly develop and commercialize new biomaterials based products 
these products are subject to regulatory clearance 
knsy will have the exclusive right to manufacture any jointly developed approved product for seven years and we will market and sell the product worldwide 
following the regulatory clearance of a new product under the agreement  we will have obligations to pay knsy for manufacturing the product  achieve minimum sales levels in the first two years for such approved product  and make royalty payments to knsy based on the net sales of such product 
in december  we received fda k clearance for the first jointly developed product  vitoss scaffold foam  and we commenced sales of the first product configuration under the vitoss scaffold foam product platform during february in addition  beginning in  and during the term of the paul royalty revenue interest agreement  we are required to make advance payments on the revenue interest obligation at the beginning of each year 
in january  we paid to paul royalty the required  advance payment in respect of net sales of our vitoss and cortoss products 
in january  the revenue interest assignment agreement with paul royalty was amended by mutual agreement to reduce the advance payment for from  to  for the year ended december   paul royalty earned  of the  advance payment made to them and the remaining  of the advance payment was recorded in prepaid revenue interest expense as of december  the  was applied against the balance of  payment that was made in february the amount of the advance payment remains  in the years through while we have sufficient cash at the end of to make the required  advance payment to paul royalty during  we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient cash to meet our advance payment obligations for the years through advance payments impact cash flow when made  and they affect earnings only as the advance payments are credited within each period against the revenue interest actually earned by paul royalty during that period  with any excess advance payments to be refunded to us shortly after the end of the year

investing cash outlook we expect the rate at which we invest funds in related to the purchase of leasehold improvements and capital equipment to increase slightly compared to we anticipate investments in additional manufacturing equipment related to our vitoss product line extensions

financing requirements outlook the extent and timing of proceeds from future stock option and warrant exercises  if any  are primarily dependent upon our common stock s market price  as well as the exercise prices and expiration dates of the stock options and warrants 
we do not expect sales to generate cash flow in excess of operating expenses for at least the next couple of years  if at all 
until such sales levels are achieved  if ever  we expect to continue to use cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund operating and investing activities 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  as of december   will be sufficient to meet our currently estimated operating and investing requirements into in january  a shelf registration was filed with the sec that is expected to allow us to raise additional capital as needed 
therefore  we may seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  or strategic alliances with third parties either alone or in combination with equity 
any such financings could result in substantial dilution to the holders of our common stock or require debt service and or revenue sharing arrangements 
in addition  any such financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
results of operations this section should be read in conjunction with the detailed discussion under liquidity and capital resources 
as described therein  we expect to continue to incur operating losses in the future as we continue our product development efforts 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december product sales 
product sales for increased to  as compared to  for the product sales increase from to is primarily attributable to improved market penetration of our vitoss scaffold micro morsels and macro morsels product configurations  which are sold under our vitoss product platform in the us additionally  the improved penetration resulted from our investments made during the second half of in our us field sales network to improve our distribution and market coverage 
approximately of product sales for were from vitoss and imbibe sales in the us  as compared to approximately of product sales from the us during the remaining sales during both and were primarily a result of vitoss and cortoss sales in europe 
gross profit 
our gross profit for the year ended december  was  or of product sales

table of contents operating expenses 
operating expenses for year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period in general administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease from  in the lower general administrative expenses were principally due to lower administrative headcount related costs 
for the year ended december   selling marketing expenses increased to  from  in the comparable period last year 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses was principally due to additional investments made in strengthening our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us sales territories where either we do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territory is under served in order to support the growth of us product sales and the increased commissions paid to the independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives in the us as a result of higher product sales

table of contents revenue interest 
during october  we completed a  product development and equity financing with paul royalty 
in this financing  we sold paul royalty a revenue interest in our vitoss  cortoss and rhakoss products in north america and europe and  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of  the revenue interest provides for paul royalty to receive on the first  of annual sales plus of annual sales in excess of  of certain of our products  including vitoss  cortoss and rhakoss in north america and europe through  subject to certain adjustments 
during  paul royalty received of vitoss and cortoss product sales 
our obligation to pay the revenue interest is secured by our licenses  patents and trademarks relating to certain of our products  including vitoss  cortoss and rhakoss in north america and europe and the revenue interest we pay to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  on the sales of these products 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
however  if we fail to maintain the specified financial covenants  paul royalty can demand that we repurchase its revenue interest 
in addition to the failure to comply with the specified financial covenants  the occurrence of certain events triggers paul royalty s right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest 
we may not have sufficient cash funds to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event 
the exact amount of the repurchase price is dependent upon certain factors  including when the repurchase event occurs 
if a repurchase event had been triggered and paul royalty exercised its right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest as of december   we would have owed paul royalty approximately  if we were unable to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event  paul royalty could foreclose on certain pledged assets  and we 
table of contents could be forced into bankruptcy 
paul royalty could also foreclose on these pledged assets if we became insolvent or involved in a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding 
no repurchase events or foreclosures have occurred as of december  or as of the date of this filing 
in the event that we were required to repurchase paul royalty s revenue interest  paul royalty would have no obligation to surrender the shares of our common stock that it had purchased as part of the revenue interest transaction 
our failure to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single source material used to manufacture vitoss  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with paul royalty 
in addition beginning in  and throughout the term of the paul royalty revenue interest agreement  we are required to make advance payments on the revenue interest obligation at the beginning of each year 
in january  we paid to paul royalty the contractually required advance payment of  of the  paid to paul royalty   was earned in and the balance of  was included in prepaid revenue interest expense as of december  in january  the revenue interest assignment agreement with paul royalty was amended by mutual agreement to reduce the advance payment for from  to  which was paid to paul royalty during february the  balance was applied against the  paid in february the amount of the advance payment remains  in the years through while we believe that we will have sufficient cash at the end of to make the required  advance payment to paul royalty during  we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient cash to meet our advance payment obligations for the years through while the advance payments will impact cash flow within a given year  they will not affect earnings as the advance payments are credited within each year against the revenue interest actually earned by paul royalty during that year  with any excess advance payments refunded to us shortly after the end of the year 
agreement with kensey nash corporation in march  we entered into an agreement with kensey nash corporation knsy to jointly develop and commercialize new biomaterials based products

following the approval  if any  of a new product under the agreement  we will have obligations to pay knsy for manufacturing the product  to achieve minimum sales levels for such approved product and make royalty payments to knsy based on the net sales of such product

table of contents certain risks related to our business an investment in the shares of our common stock involve a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the information set forth below before investing in our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose some or all of your investment 
if our approved products are not commercially successful  our operating results will be impaired 
we are highly dependent on successfully selling our products for which we have received regulatory approval 
we expect regulatory approvals in the us for our products under development  if obtained at all  to take several years 
to date  we have received regulatory approval to market vitoss  cortoss and aliquot for specified uses in the european union  australia and countries adhering to the regulatory standards of the european union 
we have also received regulatory clearance to market vitoss  endoskeleton ta and imbibe in the us for these reasons  we are dependent upon vitoss and cortoss and their ancillary products  endoskeleton ta  imbibe and aliquot  in their respective approved markets to generate sufficient revenues to sustain operations in the future 
if we are unable to increase sales of our approved products  our operating results will be affected adversely 
because our products have been commercially available for sale for less than three years and the markets for our products are evolving  we cannot accurately predict either the future growth rate of product sales  if any  or the ultimate size of these markets 
certain factors that may limit our ability to increase sales include our dependence on the efforts of independent sales agencies and independent distributors to promote the use of our products  over which we have limited control  our ability to hire and train qualified direct sales representatives to enhance our field sales network  the introduction of new products into the market by competing orthopaedic companies based upon other competing technologies  our dependence on the continued publication of independent pre clinical and clinical data to support the use of our products  our need to train a sufficient number of surgeons to create demand for our products  and the need for payors to authorize insurance reimbursement for procedures using our products 
market acceptance of our products will largely depend on our ability to demonstrate their relative safety  efficacy  cost effectiveness and ease of use 
surgeons will not use our products unless they determine  based on experience  clinical data and recommendations from prominent surgeons and mentors  that our products are safe and effective 
our products are based on new  innovative technologies that have not been previously used and must compete with more established treatments currently accepted as the standards of care 
the attributes of some of our products may 
table of contents require some changes in surgical techniques that have become standard within the medical community  and there may be resistance to change 
therefore  for these products  we must be able to convince surgeons who currently favor existing techniques to switch to new procedures that would use our products 
many surgeons will not purchase our products until there is sufficient  long term clinical evidence to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods 
we believe our product marketing efforts to date have been made to a group of early adopting surgeons 
in addition  surgeons may be slow to change their medical treatment practices because of perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of third party reimbursement for our products 
any failure to gain market acceptance of our products could result in lower sales and the inability to become profitable 
if we are unable to operate an effective field sales network  our ability to generate sales and become profitable will be impaired 
we have assembled a field sales network of independent sales agencies in the us in order to market vitoss and imbibe 
in addition  we continue to strengthen our field sales network through the recent addition of approximately twenty direct sales representatives in those us sales territories where either we do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territories are under served 
our direct sales representatives work alone and or in conjunction with our independent sales agencies 
we intend to utilize our current field sales network to market endoskeleton ta in the us outside of the us  we utilize a network of independent stocking distributors to market vitoss  cortoss  and aliquot 
any failure to maintain and manage our field sales network will impair our ability to generate sales and become profitable 
we are dependent upon these independent stocking distributors outside the us and independent sales agencies in the us for the sale of our products 
there can be no assurance that the independent stocking distributors and independent sales agencies will perform their obligations in their respective territories as expected or that we will continue to derive any revenue from these arrangements 
we cannot assure that our interests will continue to coincide with those of our independent stocking distributors and independent sales agencies or that the independent stocking distributors and independent sales agencies will not develop independently  or with alternative companies  other products that could compete with our products 
the us independent sales agencies selling our vitoss and imbibe products generally sell products from other orthopaedic companies 
a single independent sales agency may sell vitoss and imbibe to end user hospitals  as well as hardware manufactured by other orthopaedic companies consisting of metal plates  screws and titanium spinal cages 
should any of these other orthopaedic companies add a bone graft material to their product line  our independent sales agencies could decide to stop carrying vitoss and terminate their arrangement with us 
our sales could also be adversely affected if  for any reason  one or more of our successful independent sales agencies lost their hardware product line provided by other orthopaedic companies 
similarly  our independent sales agencies may be unable or unwilling to carry or effectively sell vitoss should any of these other orthopaedic companies introduce new products into the market based upon other technologies that could compete with vitoss 
additionally  our sales could be adversely affected if one or more of our successful independent sales agencies 
table of contents eliminated vitoss from their product line and terminated their arrangement with us 
these same matters may also adversely affect sales by one or more of our independent stocking distributors outside the us our ability to penetrate the markets we intend to serve is highly dependent upon the quality and breadth of the other product lines carried by our distribution network  the components of which may change from time to time  and over which we have little or no control 
the complete product line represented by the independent stocking distributors and independent sales agencies  including our products  is an important factor in the independent stocking distributors or independent sales agencies ability to penetrate the market in their respective territories 
in an effort to further accelerate the growth of sales  we began adding direct sales representatives to our organization for certain territories in the us during the addition of direct sales representatives will increase our operating expenses 
furthermore  there is no assurance that adding direct sales representatives will improve sales or that our direct sales representatives will be successful in generating sufficient sales to cover the cost of supporting their sales activities 
there is no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to market and sell our products 
finally  we have not directly sold our products in the past and may not successfully implement this type of sales and distribution method 
the off label use of our products may harm the reputation of our products 
the medical devices that we manufacture and market  or intend to market  are subject to extensive regulation by the us food and drug administration fda  the european union medical devices directive the mdd and other worldwide regulatory agencies 
in order to market our products  we must apply for  be granted and maintain all necessary regulatory approvals in each applicable jurisdiction for specified uses of the products 
we market and sell our products only for their approved indication s or use s  however  we cannot control a surgeon s off label use of our product 
we believe there has been an unmet medical need for an injectable material for use in procedures to repair vertebral compression fractures vcfs 
in an attempt to address this need  we pursued clinical studies in europe to demonstrate the safety of using our injectable product cortoss in this type of procedure 
cortoss subsequently received a ce certification in january for use in repairing vertebral compression fractures 
however  surgeons may have attempted to use cortoss off label in procedures to repair vertebral compression fractures performed prior to the european union s approval of cortoss for this type of procedure 
furthermore  all surgeons have not been trained in the proper use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs  since the european union only recently approved the use of cortoss for that type of procedure 
a surgeon who has not been properly trained to use cortoss in a procedure to repair vertebral compression fractures could pose a risk to the reputation of our cortoss product 
the occurrence of an adverse event while using our product off label could adversely affect the reputation of cortoss or any of our other products as well as our reputation 
as of the date of this filing  we are not aware that off label uses of our products have had a material adverse effect on our reputation or the reputation of our products 

table of contents if we do not successfully train a sufficient number of surgeons  demand for our products could be adversely affected 
it is critical to the commercial success of our products that our independent stocking distributors  independent sales agencies  and direct sales representatives succeed in training a sufficient number of surgeons and in providing them adequate instruction in the use of our products 
this training requires a commitment of time and money by surgeons that they may be unwilling to give 
even if surgeons are willing  if they are not properly trained  they may misuse or ineffectively use our products 
this may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes  patient injury  negative publicity or lawsuits against us  any of which could damage our business and reduce product sales 
if health care providers cannot obtain third party coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products  or if such coverage and reimbursement is inadequate  we may never become profitable 
successful sales of our products in the us and other markets will depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors 
healthcare providers  such as hospitals and surgeons that purchase medical devices for treatment of their patients  generally rely on third party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices 
both public and private insurance reimbursement plans are central to new product acceptance 
healthcare providers may refuse to use our products including  but not limited to  cortoss and rhakoss  if coverage or reimbursement are inadequate 
we do not yet know how coverage and reimbursement will be handled for all of our products because some procedures that use our products are new and reimbursement policies regarding these procedures have not been finalized 
inadequate coverage or reimbursement by private insurance companies and government programs could significantly reduce usage of our products 
in addition  an increased emphasis on managed care in the us has placed  and we believe will continue to place  greater pressure on medical device pricing 
such pressures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products 
failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain favorable coverage or reimbursement from third party payors or changes in governmental and private third party payors policies toward coverage or reimbursement for procedures employing our products would reduce demand for our products 
any investigation or prosecution under the anti fraud and abuse laws may adversely affect our business 
in addition to the medicare coverage and reimbursement limitations discussed above  other aspects of the medicare program may negatively affect us or our products 
in  congress adopted the medicare and medicaid anti fraud and abuse amendments of  which have been strengthened by subsequent amendments and the creation of the office of inspector general oig to enforce compliance with the statute  as amended the anti fraud and abuse law 
the anti fraud and abuse law prohibits the knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation  or receipt of any remuneration in any form as an inducement or reward for either the referral of patients or the arranging for reimbursable services 
a violation of the statute is a felony and could result in criminal and civil penalties  including exclusion from the medicare program 
the 
table of contents department of health and human services has issued regulations from time to time setting forth so called safe harbors  which would protect certain limited types of arrangements from prosecution under the statute 
failure to comply with each element of a particular safe harbor does not mean that an arrangement is in violation of the anti fraud and abuse law 
the purpose of the safe harbors is to set forth standards for certain non violative arrangements 
we believe our arrangements are in compliance with the federal anti fraud and abuse law  however  no assurance can be given that regulatory authorities will not take a contrary position 
federal law also provides for minimum periods of exclusion from federal and state health care programs for certain offenses and frauds 
also  the federal civil false claims act prohibits knowingly presenting including causing the submission of a false  fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the united states 
actions under the civil false claims act may be brought by the attorney general or as an action by a private individual in the name of the government 
violations of the false claims act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages 
the federal government is using the civil false claims act  and the threat of significant liability  in its investigations of health care providers  suppliers and manufacturers throughout the country for a wide variety of medicare billing practices  and has obtained multi million dollar settlements 
given the significant size of actual and potential settlements  it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources in investigating healthcare providers  suppliers and manufacturers compliance with health care billing  coverage and reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws 
any investigation  prosecution or sanction under state or federal fraud and abuse laws could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
health care reimbursement or reform legislation could materially affect our business 
if any national health care reform or other legislation or regulations are passed that imposes limits on coverage or the amount of reimbursement for certain types of medical procedures or products  or on the number or type of medical procedures that may be performed  or that has the effect of restricting a physician s ability to select specific products for use in patient procedures  such changes could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products 
our product sales depend largely on us and foreign government health care programs and private health insurers reimbursing patients medical expenses 
physicians  hospitals  and other health care providers may not purchase our products if they do not receive satisfactory reimbursement from these third party payers for the cost of procedures using our products 
in the us  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement greater governmental control over the health care industry and its related costs 
these proposals create uncertainty as to the future of our industry and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital or to form collaborations 
in a number of foreign markets  the pricing and profitability of health care products are subject to governmental influence or control 
in addition  legislation or regulations that impose restrictions on the price that may be charged for health care products or medical devices may adversely affect our sales and profitability 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
if we are unable to raise additional capital in the future  our product development could be limited and our long term viability may be threatened  however  if we raise additional capital  your percentage ownership as a shareholder of orthovita will decrease and constraints could be placed on the operation of our business 

table of contents we have experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception and have funded our operations primarily from proceeds received from sales of our stock 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately  as of december  will be sufficient to meet our currently estimated operating and investing requirements into while we have no immediate plans to do so  we may seek to obtain additional funds at any time in the future through subsequent equity or debt financings  or strategic alliances with third parties  either alone or in combination with equity 
these financings could result in substantial dilution to the holders of our common stock or require contractual or other restrictions on our operations or on alternatives that may be available to us in considering strategic transactions  dividend or liquidation preferences  debt service and or revenue sharing arrangements 
any such required financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
factors that may cause our future capital requirements to be greater than anticipated or could accelerate our need for funds include  without limitation unforeseen developments during our pre clinical and clinical trials  further enhancements to our field sales network  delays in the timing of receipt of required regulatory approvals  unanticipated expenditures in research and development or manufacturing activities  delayed market acceptance of our products  unanticipated expenditures in the acquisition and defense of intellectual property rights  the failure to develop strategic alliances for the marketing of some of our products  additional inventory builds to adequately support the launch of new product configurations  unforeseen difficulties in establishing and operating an effective direct sales and distribution network  unforeseen changes in healthcare reimbursement for procedures using our products  inability to increase sales of our approved products  inability to train a sufficient number of surgeons to create demand for our products  lack of financial resources to adequately support our operations  difficulties in maintaining commercial scale manufacturing capacity and capability  unforeseen problems with our third party manufacturers and service providers or with our specialty suppliers of certain raw materials  unanticipated difficulties in operating in international markets  inability to meet our obligations under a revenue sharing agreement  unanticipated financial resources needed to respond to technological changes and increased competition  unforeseen problems in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to market our products  enactment of new legislation or administrative regulation  the application to our business of new court decisions and regulatory interpretations  claims that might be brought in excess of our insurance coverage  
table of contents any imposition of penalties for failure to comply with regulatory guidelines  or management s perception that in the future  uncertainties at that time  relating to these factors may increase 
in addition  although we have no present commitments or understandings to do so  we may seek to expand our operations and product line through acquisitions or joint ventures 
any such acquisitions or joint ventures may increase our capital requirements 
if adequate financing is not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain operations 
in the worst case  our long term viability would be threatened 
if we fail to obtain and maintain the regulatory approvals necessary to sell our products  sales could be delayed or never realized 
the jurisdictions in which we will seek to market our products will regulate these products as medical devices 
in most circumstances  we and our independent stocking distributors and independent sales agencies must obtain regulatory approvals and otherwise comply with extensive regulations regarding safety  quality and efficacy standards 
these regulations vary from country to country  and the regulatory review can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
we may not obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals necessary to market our products in our targeted markets 
moreover  regulatory approvals that are obtained may involve significant restrictions on the anatomic sites and types of procedures for which our products can be used 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our regulatory approvals 
if we do not obtain or maintain regulatory approvals to enable us to market our products in the us or elsewhere  or if the approvals are subject to significant restrictions  we may never generate significant revenues 
the regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we currently market or intend to market our products are outlined below 
united states regulation by fda 
the fda regulates the clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
to date  we have received approval from the fda to market products under our vitoss  endoskeleton ta and imbibe product platforms 
after the completion of an fda approved ide pilot clinical study  during  we received approval from the fda to conduct a pivotal clinical study in the us for the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the vertebroplasty surgical technique and intend to enroll patients beginning in also during  we received approval from the fda and began patient enrollment of a second fda approved ide pilot clinical study in the us for the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the kyphoplasty surgical technique 
there can be no assurance that the data from these clinical trials will support fda clearance or approval to market this product for this use 
we are currently manufacturing vitoss and cortoss in the us  distributing vitoss and imbibe in the us and distributing vitoss  cortoss and aliquot outside the us we are manufacturing vitoss canisters  imbibe  endoskeleton ta  and aliquot in the us through outside third party contract manufacturers 
in addition  during march  we 
table of contents entered into an agreement with knsy whereby knsy will have the exclusive right to manufacture any approved jointly developed products under the agreement for seven years 
our vitoss is converted to vitoss scaffold foam by knsy  our development partner 
vitoss  as well as any other products that we manufacture or distribute following their approval by the fda  will be subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
if safety or efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market  the fda may impose severe limitations on the use of any approved or cleared product 
moreover  modifications to the approved or cleared product may require the submission of a new approval application or application supplement 
we may not be successful in obtaining approval to market the modified product in a timely manner  if at all 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 
european union and other international markets general 
international sales of medical devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the products are sold 
accordingly  the introduction of our products in markets outside the us will be subject to regulatory clearances in those jurisdictions 
the regulatory review process varies from country to country 
many countries also impose product standards  packaging and labeling requirements and import restrictions on medical devices 
in addition  each country has its own tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
the approval by foreign government authorities is unpredictable  uncertain and can be expensive 
our ability to market our products could be substantially limited due to delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  the necessary approvals or clearances 
requirement of ce certification in the european union 
to market a product in the european union  we must be entitled to affix a ce certification  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives 
a ce certification allows us to market a product in all of the countries of the european union  as well as in other countries  such as switzerland and israel  that have adopted the european union s regulatory standards 
to date  we have received a ce certification for the use of vitoss as a bone void filler and for the use of cortoss in screw augmentation and vertebral augmentation of vcf procedures 
additionally  we are conducting clinical trials with rhakoss as an interbody fusion device for use in cervical spinal fusion surgery 
there can be no assurance that we will receive ce certification for vitoss and cortoss for additional indications for use  if requested  or that we will received ce certification for rhakoss or any of our other products under development 
requirement of approval in japan 
in order to market our products in japan  we must obtain the approval of the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare 
we will need to conduct clinical trials for vitoss and cortoss in japan to obtain approval there for those two products 
accordingly  we will need to enter into a third party strategic alliance to conduct such clinical trials  obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and market vitoss and cortoss in japan 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in achieving such an alliance or that we will ultimately obtain the approvals necessary to market our products in japan 

table of contents if we do not manage commercial scale manufacturing capability and capacity for our product in compliance with regulatory requirements and in a cost effective manner  our product sales may suffer 
our vitoss and cortoss manufacturing facilities produce commercial products and are currently certified as meeting the requirements of european norm en iso for the period july  through july  and are subject to inspection by the fda for compliance with fda device manufacture requirements 
the most recent fda inspection resulted with no corrective actions being required 
in addition to the need for regulatory approval of cortoss in the us  in order to commercialize cortoss in the us  the cortoss manufacturing facility and quality assurance system must first pass inspection by the fda 
we are manufacturing vitoss canisters  imbibe  endoskeleton ta  and aliquot through outside third party contract manufacturers 
our vitoss is converted to vitoss scaffold foam by knsy  our development partner 
our third party manufacturers and development partners are iso certified or have been audited by us and determined to meet our quality system requirements 
our product sales depend upon  among other things  our ability to manufacture our products in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements and in a cost effective manner 
the manufacture of our products is subject to regulation and periodic inspection by various regulatory bodies for compliance with quality standards 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will not  during the course of an inspection of existing or new facilities  identify what they consider to be deficiencies in meeting the applicable standards and request or seek remedial action 
failure to comply with such regulations or a delay in attaining compliance may result in warning letters  injunctions suspending our manufacture of products  civil and criminal penalties  refusal to grant premarket approvals  ce certifications or clearances to products that are subject to future or pending submissions  product recalls or seizures of products  and total or partial suspensions of production 
we are dependent upon a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
our ability to manufacture vitoss and cortoss is dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
the failure of a supplier to continue to provide us with these materials at a price or quality acceptable to us  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture these products 
moreover  our failure to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single sourced material used to manufacture vitoss  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with paul royalty 
although we believe that we maintain good relationships with our suppliers  there can be no guarantee that such supplies and services will continue to be available with respect to our current and future commercialized products 

table of contents we are dependent upon third party manufacturers for the supply of certain products that we sell 
we are manufacturing vitoss canisters  endoskeleton ta  imbibe and aliquot through outside third party contract manufacturers 
our third party manufacturers are iso certified or have been determined by us to meet our quality system requirements 
in addition  our vitoss is converted to vitoss scaffold foam by knsy  our development partner 
during march  we entered into an agreement with knsy to jointly develop and commercialize new biomaterials based products 
the new products that may be developed under this agreement will be based on our proprietary vitoss bone void filler material in combination with biomaterials proprietary to knsy 
knsy will have the exclusive right to manufacture any such approved jointly developed products under the agreement for seven years 
there can be no guarantee these third party manufacturers will continue to provide such supplies and services with respect to our current and future commercialized products 
the difficulties of operating in international markets may harm sales of our products 
the international nature of our business subjects us and our representatives  independent sales agents and independent stocking distributors to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate  and in which our products are sold 
the types of risks that we face in international operations include but are not limited to the imposition of governmental controls  logistical difficulties in managing international operations  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international sales and operations may be limited or disrupted if we cannot successfully meet the challenges of operating internationally 
if losses continue in the long term  it could limit our growth in the orthopaedic industry and slow our generation of revenues  or jeopardize our viability 
to date  we have not been profitable 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and  at december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately  these losses have resulted principally from the development and patenting of our technologies  pre clinical and clinical studies  preparation of submissions to the fda and foreign regulatory bodies  the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  and unforeseen competitor developments that adversely affect our field sales network 

table of contents we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in the future as we continue our product development efforts  expand our marketing and sales activities and further develop our manufacturing capabilities 
we may not ever successfully commercialize our products in development 
we may never be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future and our products may never be commercially accepted or generate sufficient revenues 
if we fail to meet our obligations under a revenue sharing agreement  we may be required to repurchase from an investor its right to receive revenues on certain of our product sales  and the investor could foreclose on certain assets that are essential to our operations 
during october  we completed a  product development and equity financing with paul royalty 
in this financing  we sold paul royalty a revenue interest and  shares of our common stock 
the revenue interest provides for paul royalty to receive on the first  of annual sales plus of annual sales in excess of  of certain of our products  including vitoss  cortoss and rhakoss  in north america and europe through  subject to certain adjustments 
during  paul royalty received of vitoss and cortoss product sales 
this revenue interest percentage can increase if we fail to meet contractually specified levels of annual net sales of products for which paul royalty is entitled to receive its revenue interest 
we do not currently expect that changes in the revenue interest percentage resulting from fluctuations in sales of products subject to the revenue interest will have a material effect on operating results for a period when considered relative to sales of the products for that period 
beginning in  and throughout the term of the paul royalty revenue interest agreement  we are required to make advance payments on the revenue interest obligation at the beginning of each year 
in january  we paid to paul royalty the contractually required advance payment of  of the  paid to paul royalty   was earned in and the balance of  was included in prepaid revenue interest expense as of december  in january  the revenue interest assignment agreement with paul royalty was amended by mutual agreement to reduce the advance payment for from  to  which was paid to paul royalty during february net of the prepaid revenue interest balance of  as of december  
the amount of the advance payment remains  in the years through while we believe that we will have sufficient cash at the end of to make the required  advance payment to paul royalty during  we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient cash to meet our advance payment obligations for the years through while the advance payments will impact cash flow within a given year  they will not affect earnings as the advance payments are credited within each year against the revenue interest actually earned by paul royalty during that year  with any excess advance payments refunded to us shortly after the end of the year 
our obligation to pay the revenue interest is secured by our licenses  patents and trademarks relating to certain of our products  including vitoss  cortoss and rhakoss  in north america and europe  and the revenue interest we pay to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  on the sales of our products collectively  the pledged assets 
we are also required to maintain cash and cash equivalent balances equal to or greater than the product of i and ii total operating losses  net of non cash charges  for the preceding fiscal quarter  and 
table of contents total shareholders equity of at least  provided  however  that under the provisions of the agreement with paul royalty  when calculating shareholders equity for the purposes of the financial covenants  the revenue interest obligation is included in shareholders equity 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
however  if we fail to maintain such balances and shareholders equity  paul royalty can demand that we repurchase its revenue interest 
in addition to the failure to comply with the financial covenants described above  the occurrence of certain events  including those set forth below  triggers paul royalty s right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest a judicial decision that has a material adverse effect on our business  operations  assets or financial condition  the acceleration of our obligations or the exercise of default remedies by a secured lender under certain debt instruments  a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy that involves us or one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  our insolvency  a change in control of our company  and the breach of a representation  warranty or certification made by us in the agreements with paul royalty that  individually or in the aggregate  would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  assets or financial condition  and such breach is not cured within days after notice thereof from paul royalty 
we may not have sufficient cash funds to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event 
the exact amount of the repurchase price is dependent upon certain factors  including when the repurchase event occurs 
if a repurchase event had been triggered and paul royalty exercised its right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest as of december   we would have owed paul royalty  the repurchase price for paul royalty s revenue interest as of a given date is calculated in three steps 
first  a specified annual rate of return not to exceed is applied to paul royalty s  original purchase price from october  to the date of determination of the repurchase price 
second  the result obtained from the first step of the calculation is added to the original  purchase price 
third  the sum obtained from the second step of the calculation is reduced by both  and the actual revenue interest paid during the specified period 
if we were unable to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event  paul royalty could foreclose on the pledged assets  and we could be forced into bankruptcy 
paul royalty could also foreclose on the pledged assets if we became insolvent or involved in a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding 
no repurchase events or foreclosures have occurred as of december  or as of the date of this filing 
in the event that we repurchased paul royalty s revenue interest  paul royalty would have no obligation to surrender the shares of our common stock that it had purchased as part of the revenue interest assignment transaction 

table of contents our results of operations may fluctuate due to factors out of our control  which could cause volatility in our stock price 
vitoss  imbibe  cortoss  aliquot and endoskeleton ta are currently our only products for which we have received regulatory approvals for sale either in the us and or the european union 
vitoss is cleared for sale in the us and the european union 
imbibe is cleared for sale in the us cortoss and aliquot are cleared for sale in the european union 
endoskeleton ta was cleared for sale in the us during december we began selling vitoss in europe in the fourth quarter of and began selling vitoss in the us late in the first quarter of we began sales of cortoss in europe and imbibe in the us at the end of  we began sales of aliquot in europe in the second quarter of future levels of vitoss  cortoss  aliquot  imbibe and endoskeleton ta  product sales are difficult to predict 
sales of vitoss  imbibe  cortoss  and aliquot to date may not be indicative of future sales levels 
vitoss  cortoss and aliquot sales levels in europe may fluctuate due to the timing of any independent distributor stocking orders and vitoss and imbibe sales levels may fluctuate in the us due to the timing of orders from hospitals 
we have not yet begun to sell endoskeleton ta in the us our results of operations may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to the timing of governmental approvals for our products and our competitors products  unanticipated events associated with clinical and pre clinical trials of our products  the medical community s acceptance of our products  the timing in obtaining adequate third party reimbursement of our products  the success of products competitive with ours  our ability to enter into strategic alliances with other companies  expenses associated with development and protection of intellectual property matters  establishment of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  events affecting logistics and elective surgery trends  the timing of expenses related to commercialization of new products  the timing and success in building our field sales network  competitive disruptions to our field sales network from business development arrangements  and the adequate training of a sufficient number of surgeons 
the results of our operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may not meet expectations of securities analysts and investors 
this may cause our stock price to be volatile 

table of contents our business will be damaged if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to vitoss  cortoss or our other products  and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by others 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these measures afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights 
for example  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by third parties 
as of december   the products we have developed and marketed are covered by one or more of our nine issued us patents  fourteen pending us patent applications and several counterparts of certain of these patents and pending patent applications worldwide  including canada  europe  mexico and japan 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of the pending patent applications 
moreover  we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or we were the first to file patent applications for the relevant inventions for the following reasons patent applications filed prior to december in the us are maintained in secrecy until issued  patent applications filed after november in the us are maintained in secrecy until eighteen months from the date of filing  and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries 
if we do receive a patent  it may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary position in the technology or to be commercially useful to us 
in addition  if we lose any key personnel  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us finally  even if our intellectual property rights are adequately protected  litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs to us and result in a diversion of management attention 
if our intellectual property is not adequately protected  our competitors could use the intellectual property that we have developed to enhance their products and compete more directly with us  which could damage our business 
in addition to the risk of failing to adequately protect our proprietary rights  there is a risk that we may become subject to a claim that we infringe upon the proprietary rights of others 
although we do not believe that we are infringing the rights of others  third parties may claim that we are doing so 
there is a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry generally  and in the spinal market segments particularly 
if the holder of patents brought an infringement action against us  the cost of litigating the claim could be substantial and divert management attention 
in addition  if a court determined that one of our products infringed a patent  we could be prevented from selling that product unless we could obtain a license from the owner of the patent 
a license may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
modification of our products or development of new products to avoid infringement may require us to conduct additional clinical trials for these new or modified products and to revise our filings with the fda  which is time consuming and expensive 
if we were not successful in obtaining a license or redesigning our product  our business could suffer 

table of contents if we cannot keep up with technological changes and marketing initiatives of competitors  sales of our products may be harmed 
extensive research efforts and rapid technological change characterize the market for products in the orthopaedic market 
we anticipate that we will face intense competition from medical device  medical products and pharmaceutical companies 
our products could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete by competitors technological advances 
we may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products 
moreover  many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution  manufacturing and technological resources than us 
these competitors may be in the process of seeking fda or other regulatory approvals  or patent protection  for their respective products 
our competitors could  therefore  commercialize competing products in advance of our products 
they may also enjoy substantial advantages over us in terms of research and development expertise  experience in conducting clinical trials  experience in regulatory matters  manufacturing efficiency  name recognition  sales and marketing expertise  capital and financial resources  established distribution channels  and established relationships with health care providers and payors 
as a result of the above  our plans for market acceptance of our products may be adversely impacted 
we may acquire technologies or companies in the future  and these acquisitions could result in dilution to our shareholders and disruption of our business 
entering into an acquisition could divert management attention 
we also could fail to assimilate the acquired company  which could lead to higher operating expenses 
finally  our shareholders could be diluted if we issue shares of our stock to acquire another company or technology 
by increasing the number of shares of our common stock that may be sold into the market  we could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
in january  a shelf registration was filed with the sec that is expected to allow us to raise additional capital as needed 
therefore  we may seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  or strategic alliances with third parties either alone or in combination with equity 
any such financings could result in substantial dilution to the holders of our common stock or require debt service and or revenue sharing arrangements 
in addition  any such financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents in  shares of series a preferred stock were voluntarily converted into  shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the series a preferred stock 
in addition on july   we announced that we were calling for redemption on july  all of the warrants to purchase an aggregate  shares of our common stock that were issued during july and october as part of our series a preferred stock financing 
pursuant to the call for redemption  upon redemption  holders would have received a total of per share of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants being redeemed 
alternatively  on or prior to july   holders could have elected to exercise their warrants at the per share price set forth in the applicable warrant instrument 
the terms of the warrants provided that the exercise price of any warrants exercised through the redemption date be paid in cash 
however  in an effort to decrease the aggregate number of shares issued upon the exercise of the warrants  among other matters  we agreed to offer all holders of the warrants the option to pay the exercise price by the surrender and cancellation of a portion of shares of common stock then held by the holder of such warrants or issuable upon such exercise of the warrants 
any shares so surrendered by holders electing the cashless exercise alternative offered by us were to be valued at per share of common stock and credited toward the total exercise price due us upon the exercise of the warrants 
this amount was equal to the average of the closing sale prices of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market for the trading days preceding july   the date on which our board of directors approved the redemption of the warrants 
holders of the warrants called for redemption elected to exercise all of their warrants pursuant to the cashless exercise alternative offered by us and described above 
accordingly  during july  we issued an aggregate  shares of our common stock upon the cashless exercise of the warrants to purchase an aggregate  shares of our common stock 
the call for the redemption of the warrants issued in our series a preferred stock and warrant financing consummated in july and october followed the automatic conversion of the series a preferred stock into common stock on june  as a result of the average of the closing prices of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market over the trading days ended june   on june   the shares of our series a preferred stock became subject to an automatic conversion provision set forth in the terms of the series a preferred stock 
based on facts known to us regarding the beneficial ownership of the holders of the series a preferred stock at the time of such automatic conversion  of the  shares of series a preferred stock outstanding on june    shares automatically converted into  shares of common stock 
as a result of terms of the series a preferred stock that limit the number of shares of series a preferred stock that automatically convert by virtue of beneficial ownership limitations applicable to certain shareholders  the remaining shares of series a preferred stock the blocked series a preferred shares have not yet converted but shall automatically convert into an aggregate of  shares of common stock as soon as the beneficial ownership limitation would not prevent such conversion 
nevertheless  as of june   dividends ceased to accrue on the blocked series a preferred shares and holders of the blocked series a preferred shares were no longer entitled to liquidation preferences  veto rights  anti dilution protection or redemption rights 
accordingly  holders of the blocked series a preferred shares have no rights superior to holders of our common stock

as of march   there are shares of the blocked series a preferred shares outstanding  which convert into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 

table of contents our prior use of arthur andersen llp as our independent public accountants could impact our ability to access the capital markets 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  were audited by arthur andersen llp andersen 
on march   andersen was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the government s investigation of enron corporation 
following this event  our audit committee directed management to consider the need to appoint new independent public accountants 
on june   a jury found andersen guilty of the government s charges 
on july   at the direction of the board of directors  acting upon the recommendation of the audit committee  we dismissed andersen and appointed kpmg llp as our independent public accountants 
sec rules require us to present our audited financial statements in various sec filings  along with andersen s consent to our inclusion of its audit report in those filings 
however  andersen is unable to provide a consent to us for inclusion in our future sec filings relating to its report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  additionally  andersen is unable to provide us with assurance services  such as advice customarily given to underwriters of our securities offerings and other similar market participants 
the sec has provided regulatory relief designed to allow companies that file reports with the sec to dispense with the requirement to file a consent of andersen in certain circumstances 
notwithstanding this relief  the inability of andersen to provide its consent or to provide assurance services to us in the future could negatively affect our ability to  among other things  access the public capital markets 
any delay or inability to access the public markets as a result of this situation could have a material adverse impact on our business 
also  an investor s ability to seek potential recoveries from andersen related to any claims that an investor may assert as a result of the audit performed by andersen may be limited significantly both as a result of an absence of a consent and the diminished amount of assets of andersen that are or may in the future be available to satisfy claims 
provisions of pennsylvania law or our articles of incorporation may deter a third party from seeking to obtain control of us or may affect your rights as a shareholder 
certain provisions of pennsylvania law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire us 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in addition  our articles of incorporation enable our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock having rights  privileges and preferences as are determined by the board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights superior to those of our common shareholders 
for example  an issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the common shareholders  make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium  or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the common stock
