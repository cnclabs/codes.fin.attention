index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the periods presented 
listed below are our most significant accounting policies and estimates  which we think are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
please keep the following policies and estimates in mind when reading the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes 
accounts receivable we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer information 
we maintain credit insurance on major customer balances and have a relatively diversified customer base 
in the current year  our losses due to credit issues were very small 
however  there is no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same low rates in the future 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of a large customer or group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to collect our receivables and we may incur losses as a result 
inventory we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory on a first in  first out basis or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we use a standard cost system to estimate the actual costs of inventory and regularly review actual costs and the estimated market value of inventory to standard costs 
significant changes to our purchasing or manufacturing costs either an increase or a decrease could cause material changes to the valuation of our inventory when we adjust standard costs to reflect the change 
we estimate the market value of inventory based upon existing and forecasted demand for end products for the next twelve months and estimated amounts of inventory that would be consumed 
we reduce the valuation of inventory items that are in excess supply compared to demand  items that have had limited usage over time  items that may no longer be usable due to product obsolescence and items that we decide to discontinue selling 
we have a product rationalization process that involves key management personnel to identify and evaluate products and related inventory that fall into those situations 
in recent years we have written off significant amounts of inventory 
in fiscal we wrote down million of inventory to reflect changes that occurred in our marketing strategy to accelerate the migration of our products to smaller packages 
this was done in response to an abrupt shift in market requirements toward smaller packages 
if the facts and circumstances require it  we may have to write down inventory again in future periods 
our electronics industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could make such write downs necessary 
also  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the valuation adjustments for obsolete and slow moving inventory may be understated or overstated 
if we change our estimate of future demand  we may have to increase or decrease our inventory valuation reserves for excess inventory  with a corresponding impact on cost of sales 
we continually review our inventory valuations for all of these factors 
however  
table of contents 
index to financial statements significant changes in manufacturing costs  unanticipated changes in product demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we regularly review our long lived assets for changes in circumstances indicating that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
we measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
as an example  we have moved assembly production offshore and consolidated our dallas operations 
this change in circumstances caused us to test for an impairment loss and ultimately record a million charge in fiscal related to fixed assets 
deferred tax assets in fiscal year we recorded a full asset valuation allowance against tax loss carryforwards and other tax benefits according to the sfas accounting for income taxes guidelines 
since then we have recorded no additional net federal tax benefits or expenses  since they were offset by the valuation allowance 
the only exception to this was in fiscal year when a change in tax law allowed us to collect a significant tax refund  which was recorded in the period in which the change in tax law occurred 
we still retain a large amount of potential tax benefits for tax loss carryforwards and other factors  as explained in the notes to the financial statements 
these benefits may be realized in future periods 
as a result  we do not expect to record significant federal income tax expense for some time 
accrued medical benefits we largely self insure the payment of medical benefits to our employees 
consequently we regularly estimate the value of unpaid benefits based upon historical trends and use that information to record our liability for benefits that have been incurred but not yet paid 
we have stop loss insurance protection to cover the costs of medical claims over certain deductible amounts for any given plan year for an individual claimant or in the aggregate 
however  medical claims may significantly and unexpectedly increase or decrease over a short period of time  in which case our liability for unpaid claims may no longer be accurate 
this could cause us to either increase or decrease medical expense in a material way in the period in which the change occurred 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for the most part when we ship the product to the customer 
less than of fiscal sales were recognized under programs in which inventory is consigned to a customer 
we recognize sales from consigned products when the customer pulls the product for use from the consigned inventory 
in all cases  we recognize sales at the point at which legal title passes to the customer 
our standard terms and conditions are fob our factory 
we permit the return of defective products and accept limited amounts of product returns in other instances 
accordingly  we provide allowances for the estimated amounts of these returns based on historical experience when we recognize revenue

our fourth product line  low power components  also experienced an increase in the number of units sold  but that was more than offset by the continuing decline in average selling prices for these products 
the primary market for low power components is the automotive market for keyless entry and tire pressure monitoring applications 
the automotive market is very price competitive and we have had to reduce average selling prices significantly in the current year to maintain our market position 
this is the primary reason why sales for low power components declined almost in the current year 
we expect the trend for lower average selling prices for low power components to continue  and it may result in lower sales for these products in the future 
we have anticipated this potential trend for some time 
as a result  for several years we have focused our product and market development efforts on products with technical content to allow them to be sold at higher average selling prices 
we had considerable success in increasing sales for these higher priced products in the current year 
sales increased more than for these products  as we sold more units  particularly filters for the satellite radio application which is discussed below 
we compete in very price competitive markets in which customers require decreased prices over time to maintain their business 
in addition  we understand that as new products ramp up in volume our customers expect economy of scale to result in lower pricing 
as a result  two of our product lines experienced a decline in average selling prices in the current year of or more 
a decline in average selling prices adversely impacts gross margin  as well as sales 
therefore  offsetting this impact is an important part of our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements strategic plan 
we have achieved significant market position in most of the markets on which we focus 
however  we believe that price competition from much larger and better financed competitors represents a significant risk in maintaining our sales levels and gross margins  particularly in the automotive market 
one of the biggest factors in determining what happens to total sales in the future will be whether or not the anticipated growth in higher priced product line sales will be greater than or less than the anticipated decline in sales for our low power components business 
we expect sales for our first quarter of fiscal to be to greater than the prior year 
for further information  please see the discussion of fourth quarter results and further sales guidance on the first quarter of fiscal below under the heading fourth quarter of fiscal 
our sales success is highly dependent on the following factors achieving technological advances in our product design and manufacturing capabilities  our ability to sell our products in a competitive marketplace that can be influenced by outside factors  such as economic and regulatory conditions  competition from alternative technologies or from competitors duplicating our technologies  and the impact of competitive pricing 
these and other factors may adversely affect our ability to grow or even maintain our sales levels 
we have experienced sudden increases in demand in the past  which have put pressure on our manufacturing facilities and those of our offshore contractors to increase capacity to meet this demand 
in addition  new products sometimes require different manufacturing processes than we currently possess 
we may not be able to increase our manufacturing capacity  the manufacturing capacity of our assembly contractors  or improve our manufacturing processes in a timely manner so as to take advantage of increased market demand 
failure to do this could result in a material loss of potential sales 
overall sales trends in fiscal year compared to fiscal year our total sales were approximately the same in fiscal as they were in fiscal however  our individual product lines showed very different trends year over year 
our base business has been the low power components product line 
these products had accounted for well over half of our sales for many years 
the primary market for these products is the automotive market which is very price competitive 
we have had to reduce average selling prices significantly to maintain our market position  which is the primary reason why sales for this base business declined almost in fiscal for several years we have focused our product and market development efforts on products with technical content to allow them to be sold at higher average selling prices to offset the trend of lower sales for low power components 
sales increased more than for these higher priced products in fiscal  as we sold almost more units  including several new products 
in fiscal the decrease in our base business sales was just about equal to the increase in sales of higher priced products  resulting in overall sales slightly less than fiscal product line sales trends low power components sales for low power components products decreased in the current year and in fiscal the decrease in sales for the current year was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices  partially offset by a increase in the number of units sold 
the decrease in sales for the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices  together with a decrease in the number of units sold 
the primary market for these products is the automotive market  which is characterized by very competitive conditions and declining average selling prices 
in each of fiscal and there was a decrease in the number of units sold for our older style to packaged products  which continued the trend of applications for those products either converting to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements surface mount versions or being lost to lower priced competitors 
sales of to packaged products now amount to less than of total low power component sales 
the number of units sold of surface mount products increased in the current year and was almost unchanged in the prior year 
in both fiscal years  sales for keyless entry applications decreased due to loss of some sales to alternative technologies  but that was partially offset by increased sales for tire pressure monitoring applications 
during the year  sales of low power components products fluctuated in accordance with changing production schedules for automotive customers 
we expect this fluctuation to continue 
competitive pressures and consumer preferences in the low power components and filter markets caused us to change our marketing strategy in the third quarter of the prior year 
we significantly accelerated the migration of these older version products to new smaller packages 
in addition  we modified our product line strategy by reallocating resources to support products in newer  smaller packages and discontinued selected products 
discontinued products resulted in a less than reduction in annual sales 
we believe we have the package sizes available to meet or exceed competitive offerings and meet customer expectations 
during fiscal we introduced more than new products 
some of these were low power component products in smaller packages which we expect will have increasing market acceptance in fiscal we expect that the trend of lower average selling prices for low power component products to continue at close to the same rate as many customers convert to our products in smaller packages 
in addition  the trend toward lower to product sales is expected to continue 
we believe the number of units sold for tire pressure monitoring applications will continue to increase  partially offsetting these events 
we also believe that the tread act  which mandates a growing number of new vehicles in the united states to have some form of tire pressure monitoring  will continue to increase market demand 
proposed regulations to implement this legislation may go into effect in calendar year  which may have a favorable impact on demand for the type of products we make that support the direct conversion method of tire pressure monitoring 
we believe there is still considerable uncertainty as to the actual impact of the potential regulations on us 
as a result of these various factors  we think low power components sales may decrease somewhat in the next fiscal year  despite the fact that the number of units sold may increase 
virtual wire short range radio products sales for virtual wire short range radio products increased in the current year and in the prior year 
one of the primary applications for these products is automated meter reading or amr 
sales for the amr application increased in the current year 
the increase in both fiscal and was primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold of in the current year and in fiscal partially offsetting this effect was the fact that average selling prices for these products declined as unit volumes increased and customers reached negotiated volume price reduction levels 
this effect was much smaller for these products than products in other  more competitive markets 
for several years we have devoted considerable resources developing and marketing virtual wire short range radio products 
we believe these products offer potential for significant growth in sales in numerous wireless applications  particularly for applications that require small size and low power consumption 
we intend to continue working with our customers to develop new applications using virtual wire short range radio products and we expect future sales increases for these products 
in addition  we have formed a module group to take advantage of new products designed to use this core radio technology to develop and market higher level products that fit the low power consumption requirements of mesh network products 
however  it is difficult for us to predict when  or if  these products will have a significant impact on our sales 

table of contents 
index to financial statements filters filter sales increased in fiscal  compared to in fiscal in both fiscal years we sold an increased number of units  particularly for satellite radio applications 
the unit increase was in the current year and in fiscal we provide filters for radios that provide services from both sirius satellite radio inc nasdaq siri and xm satellite radio holdings  inc nasdaq xmsr 
we are working with both service providers on future generations of product 
we expect sales for the satellite radio application will continue to increase very rapidly as subscriptions for those services continue to increase 
we have seen both automotive and general consumer applications for satellite radio service develop 
these markets tend to be more price competitive than we have seen for many low power components markets 
partially offsetting the increase in the number of units sold was a reduction in average selling price of in the current year and in the prior year 
a portion of this was due to increased sales for newer products in smaller packages that have lower average selling prices  as well as the fact that customers reached sales volumes for which they have negotiated volume discounts 
we expect the trend for an increasing number of units sold to more than offset the trend for lower average selling prices  resulting in a general trend of increased filter sales for at least the immediate future 
frequency control modules frequency control module sales increased in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in both years was primarily due to an increased number of units sold to customers in high end computer and optical timing markets 
some of these markets have been very depressed in recent periods  so we believe the increased number of units sold represents some recovery in economic conditions in those markets 
while there have been some decreases in average selling prices for frequency control module products  the pressures are not nearly as great as in some of our other markets 
future sales of these products will be highly dependent upon economic conditions in the markets these products serve  particularly the optical timing market 
other sales trends the following table provides additional data concerning our sales percentage of sales sales for top five customers distribution sales number of customers with or more sales none none one sales for or more customer n a n a international sales our strategy is to seek diversification in our sales 
we believe we have achieved a significant level of diversification in our customers  markets  products and geographic areas 
however  due to the very competitive nature of the markets in which we compete  we may not always be able to achieve such diversification 
we consider all product sales with a delivery destination outside north america to be international sales 
the increased international sales for the current year primarily relate to the satellite radio application 
international sales are denominated primarily in us currency  although some european customers require that we sell in euros 
we have not entered into any hedging activities to mitigate the exchange risk associated with sales in foreign currency 
we intend to continue our focus on international sales 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our business 
however  international 
table of contents 
index to financial statements sales are subject to fluctuations as a result of local economic conditions and competition 
therefore  we cannot predict whether we will be able to continue to derive similar levels of our business from international sales 
we have put forth considerable effort developing new products 
however  the timing of any sales resulting from new products is dependent upon the customers product development and product introduction cycles 
it is difficult for us to predict when  or if  new products will have a significant impact on our sales 
we have seen that consumer applications are often part of special promotional programs by our customers  so sales to those customers will tend to fluctuate with the timing of those programs 
gross profit trends in fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross profit margin increased to in the current year  compared to in fiscal a major portion of the improvement from the prior year was the fact that the current year included only a minor non cash charge for obsolescence and write down of inventory  which amounted to million or of sales in fiscal this is further explained in the next paragraph 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to the continuation of our cost reduction efforts that resulted in to per unit cost manufacturing cost reductions in each of our product lines 
we have moved most of our assembly production offshore and we have reduced our dallas  texas workforce as a result 
this has resulted in significantly lower ongoing production costs 
ongoing cost reduction is crucial because of the expected trend towards lower average selling prices noted above 
additional factors that improved gross margins include increased sales that allow significant fixed manufacturing costs to be spread over additional sales and an improved product mix towards newer products we have developed that have higher margin potential 
in the third quarter of the prior year we changed our marketing strategy to significantly accelerate the migration of low power component and filter products to new  smaller packages 
we did this in response to an abrupt shift in market requirements toward smaller packages 
we experienced significant decreases in average selling prices for older style products in our second and third quarters and saw significant acceptance by customers of new products in smaller packages 
as a result  we modified our product line strategy by reallocating resources to support those newer products and by discontinuing selected products 
discontinuation of products reduced by approximately the number of products offered  but reduced sales by less than 
the change in strategy and reduction in the number of products offered  as well as other factors  resulted in a million non cash charge related to the write down of inventory recorded as cost of sales on our statements of operations 
since that time  we have disposed of most of this inventory 
gross profit trends in fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal fiscal cost of sales was million 
this included a million non cash charge of sales for obsolescence and write down of inventory  as explained above 
the decrease in gross profit due to the inventory write down was partially offset by the continuation of cost reduction achieved as a result of our restructuring program 
we transitioned volume assembly operations offshore to contract manufacturing companies over a two year period 
by the end of fiscal  this process was essentially complete 
factors influencing gross margins our gross margin continues to be influenced by several factors  some of which are unfavorable and some of which are favorable 
these unfavorable factors  some of which are outside our control include  but are not limited to  the following decrease in average selling prices as discussed above  there was a reduction in average selling prices in all of our product lines 
we expect that the trend toward lower average selling 
table of contents 
index to financial statements prices within our product lines will continue due to competitive pressures and the fact that newer products  like older products  are reaching volume based price breaks 
the impact of non cash charges for obsolescence and write downs of inventory for example  we incurred substantial non cash charges and write downs in fiscal new products encounter ramp up costs associated with new manufacturing processes we will continue to introduce new products into our manufacturing processes  and  therefore  we may be subject to unanticipated new product production costs that negatively affect our gross margin 
offsetting these unfavorable factors are other favorable factors that represent our long term efforts to improve gross margins 
these favorable factors include our success in achieving ongoing cost reduction each of our product lines has achieved cost reduction on a year over year per unit manufacturing cost basis for the past two years 
we devote considerable resources to obtaining purchasing savings and in working with our suppliers and outside contractors to improve yields  increase productivity and to improve processes that result in lower costs 
we intend to continue our efforts to reduce manufacturing costs in future periods 
shift in product mix our higher priced products  such as virtual wire short range radio products  frequency control modules and certain custom filters  have a greater long term potential for gross margins than the very price sensitive low power component and satellite radio filter products 
in the current year  the increasing importance of satellite radio filters to the filter product line has caused that product line to have gross margin characteristics similar to low power component products 
therefore  the shift in sales from low power components to filters no longer has a large impact on gross margins 
a shift in sales to the virtual wire short range radio products and frequency control modules  however  still does have a large positive impact on margins 
these higher margin products in the current year represented of total sales  compared to only in the previous year  and contributed to a slight positive shift in overall margins 
our strategy is to increase the portion of sales to products that have higher potential gross margins 
as part of that strategy  during the current year we put additional resources into the module group and started working with mesh network suppliers to develop new products that blend our technology with that of other companies to develop higher margin products 
while this is our strategy  there is no way we can assure that such an improved product mix will be achieved in future periods 
higher number of units sold or produced this results in lower average unit cost due to relatively high fixed manufacturing costs being spread over a larger amount of sales and production 
however  if sales were to decrease in future periods  this factor would become an unfavorable factor 
in our next quarter  we anticipate somewhat lower production levels that may increase costs per unit slightly 
the discussion above indicates that there are numerous factors that may have a material impact on our gross margins 
any one of them could cause a significant change in gross margin in either a favorable or unfavorable way  depending on the circumstances 
this makes long term estimates of our gross margin very difficult 
however  we believe that gross margins in the first quarter of fiscal will remain in the low of sales range

index to financial statements research and development research and development expense was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
research and development expense in fiscal increased by compared to a increase in fiscal the current year increase was due to three factors 
first  more focus was given to internal product development  while external product development declined  engineering technology sales declined approximately  along with approximately  in engineering technology cost of sales 
those resources were redirected to our own research and development activities and were therefore part of research and development expense 
second  we made a large investment in consulting and other outside services related to the development of our third generation of virtual wire short range radio products  amounting to approximately  finally  we increased our overall number of people devoted to research and development  which resulted in increasing the number of new products developed to over in the current year  compared to in fiscal we believe that the continued development of our technology and new products is essential to our success and we are committed to increasing our investment in research and development expense over the long term 
while we expect our spending related to the completion of the third generation of virtual wire short range radio products will wind down  we expect all other research and development expenses to remain the same or increase in absolute dollars over the next several quarters 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in all three years  sales and marketing expenses were of sales 
this was largely the result of changes in sales commission expenses that fluctuated in line with sales levels 
part of our increased expenses have been additional sales application support for our customers  which we plan to do at a measured pace in the future 
we expect to incur comparable or slightly higher sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars over the next several quarters  with the exception of sales commission expenses that will fluctuate in line with sales levels 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased in the current year  compared to a decrease of in fiscal the increases were related to increased compensation expense and the initial costs of implementing various new regulatory requirements  including the sarbanes oxley provisions 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain approximately the same in absolute dollars over the next several quarters 
increased expenses related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley may increase spending beyond currently planned levels 
restructuring and impairment expense in the prior year  we identified additional opportunities to create efficiencies in our dallas  texas operations by consolidating our pilot line and wafer fabrication facilities into a building that we had formerly leased 
for this and other reasons  we incurred non cash charges of million  which was primarily for equipment and other assets that will no longer be usable in our operations 
included in this charge was  in costs related to severance of employees 
the million charge was recorded as restructuring and impairment in our statements of operations 
we believe the restructuring and consolidation of our assembly operations is now complete and do not anticipate significant additional restructuring or impairment expense 
there was no restructuring or impairment expense in the current year 

table of contents 
index to financial statements other income expense other income expense  primarily interest expense on our bank debt  decreased  in the current year and  in the prior year 
this was primarily due in both years to a lower amount borrowed  as well lower interest rates 
we have paid down net bank debt by approximately million in the current year and million in the prior year 
since our bank debt has been eliminated as of the end of the fiscal year  we expect these expenses will remain low 
income tax expense benefit in both the current and prior years we recorded small provisions for state income tax and in the current year we also recorded a provision for alternative minimum federal income tax 
we expect to record relatively small income tax provisions in future periods 
the net alternative minimum federal tax is expected to be approximately of taxable income prior to applying loss carry forwards and other credits 
in fiscal  we fully reserved  in a non cash charge  all tax benefits that had been recorded prior to that point in accordance with fas we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to our historical losses and a limited history of taxable income 
however  we retain the tax benefits involved and we will realize the benefit in future periods to the extent we are profitable 
as of the end of the current year  we have income tax carry forwards and other potential tax benefits available to reduce future federal taxable income by approximately million as explained in note to our financial statements 
the net operating loss carry forward begins to expire august  we do not expect to record any significant future federal income tax benefits or expense until the recovery of deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
income loss per share the net income for the current year was million  compared to a million loss in the prior year and a  loss for fiscal our diluted income per share was 
for fiscal  compared to a basic and diluted loss of 
per share for fiscal and 
per share for fiscal the loss in the prior year was primarily due to million in non cash charges to cost of sales for obsolescence and write down of inventory and to operating expenses for restructuring and impairment expenses as explained above 
the improvement in the current year was primarily due to increased sales and increased gross margin on those sales  also as explained above 
over the past several years we have completed a restructuring program aimed at developing new products to increase sales  reducing our manufacturing costs by moving assembly operations offshore and other cost reduction programs  and generating positive operating cash flow to pay down debt and reduce interest expense 
these efforts have resulted in a marked improvement in reported results over the past several years 
fourth quarter of fiscal unaudited quarterly financial data is presented in note to the accompanying financial statements 
sales for the fourth quarter of million increased approximately  compared to million in the comparable quarter of the prior year 
sales also decreased approximately compared to the previous third quarter 
the sales increase in the current quarter compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year was primarily due to a strong or better increase in the number of units sold for three of our four product lines  particularly for satellite radio filters 
we have developed new products for each of these product lines over recent years and they continue to grow in market acceptance 
the only product line to experience a decrease in the number of units sold was low power components due to much lower production schedules at our automotive customers 
also offsetting the overall increase in units sold in comparison to the comparable quarter of the prior year was a decrease in the average selling prices of our volume product lines 
table of contents 
index to financial statements ranging from to 
see the above discussion under the heading product line sales trends for more details on the impact of average selling prices on our sales and gross margins 
our sales decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to an reduction in the number of units sold of low power components products  particularly to automotive customers as production levels at these customers were much lower 
the other three product lines experienced increases in the number of units sold ranging from to 
an expected decrease in shipments to filter customers as a result of fewer special promotions was more than offset by an increase in shipments for an application supporting a second satellite radio service provider and for a gps consumer application 
also contributing to lower sales compared to the previous quarter was a reduction of average selling prices of for virtual wire short range radio products and for filter products 
the reduction of average selling prices for the other product lines was not significant 
for our first quarter of fiscal  we expect sales to increase over the prior year s first quarter sales of million 
consistent with our historical sales cycle  first quarter sales may not exceed fourth quarter sales 
going forward  it is becoming more difficult to predict sales because some of our targeted growth markets often operate on very short lead times and general market conditions remain uncertain 
our lower backlog on increased sales for underscores this trend 
we have made tremendous progress in supporting our customers with quick response times 
gross profit margin was in the fourth quarter  compared to for the comparable quarter of the prior year and for the previous quarter 
the primary reason for the increase in gross margin from the comparable quarter of the prior year was a decrease in per unit manufacturing cost for each of our four product lines that exceeded the impact of the reduction in average selling prices 
also helping margins were increased sales volume and an improvement in product mix towards virtual wire short range radio products and frequency control modules from of total sales to of total sales 
we expect that gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal will remain in the low range 
we plan on reducing our production rates in the first quarter to offset the impact of an increase in finished goods that occurred in the fourth quarter 
this will have a slight negative impact on production costs per unit and therefore margins  as will potential unfavorable changes in product mix 
operating expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the comparable quarter of the prior year and million for the previous quarter 
the increase in operating expenses from the comparable quarter of the prior year was primarily due to an increase in research and development expense of approximately  resulting from a greater focus on internal development instead of custom engineering services and expenses related to the development of our third generation of virtual wire short range radio products 
sales and marketing expense also increased due to increased sale commissions expense related to increased sales 
general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increased compensation expense and increased costs of compliance with new financial reporting regulations 
the decrease in operating expenses from the previous quarter resulted primarily from reduced expenses related to the development of our third generation of virtual wire short range radio products and lower sales commission expense related to lower sales 
we expect that operating expenses will be flat relative to sales the next quarter  except for sales commission expense  which will change in line with sales levels 
we intend to continue our investments in research and development to support market requirements in our targeted growth markets over the next year 
we also expect that sales commission expense will continue to change in line with sales levels 
other expense was  in the fiscal fourth quarter  compared to  in the comparable quarter of the prior year and  in the previous quarter 
the decreases were primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from a lower amount borrowed 
since we have paid down our bank debt  we expect other expense to remain at very low levels for fiscal

our banking agreement contains financial covenants  some of which become increasingly restrictive over time 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of august  although we believe that we will be able to continue compliance with the covenants  there is no assurance that this will occur 
should there be a covenant violation when we have outstanding borrowings and we are unable to negotiate a waiver or amendment  the maturity of our debt could be accelerated 
in that case  other sources of cash would be needed to support our operations 
the banking agreement will expire in december at august   we maintain access to the revolving line of credit 
our revolving line of credit facility loan balance was zero at august   but a loan advance of  was available under our current borrowing base 
cash flows liquidity at august  consisted primarily of million of cash and approximately million available under our banking agreement 
net cash provided by our operating activities was million in the current year  an increase from million in the prior year 
the primary reason for increased cash provided by operations was the increase in net income by million in fiscal over the prior year 
the current year increase in net income was partially offset by a million reduction in non cash items included in net income 
last year s non cash items included million of special charges that did not recur this year 
in addition  depreciation was approximately million lower in fiscal year as a result of assets reaching the end of their lives and the various fixed asset write downs we have reported 
working capital used in operations increased by approximately  primarily because of an increase in trade receivables and inventory  partially offset by an increase in trade payables 
these increases in working capital elements were all related to increases in our sales levels 
collection of our receivables on a days sales outstanding measurement remained in the mid day range in the current year 
the inventory increase occurred mostly in finished goods during our fourth quarter as sales declined more quickly than our production levels 
since we offer our customers shorter lead times than we get from our contractors  volatile sales levels can lead to changes in inventory balances 
we plan to reduce our inventory levels in our first quarter of fiscal we continued to be within payment terms with our vendors in fiscal we expect to maintain a positive cash flow from operations for fiscal  as we did in the last three years 
we believe continued positive cash flow  as well as access to our credit facilities  will be sufficient to maintain normal operations for the next twelve months 
cash used in investing activities was million in the current year  compared to million for the prior year 
the reduction was primarily due to reduced capital spending of approximately million in the current year compared to million in the prior year 
the bulk of our capital spending for the prior year was for the purchase of a building that we had formerly leased and improvements to that building 
we expect to acquire up to million of capital equipment by the end of fiscal  primarily related to the development of new products and new manufacturing processes 
we used million in net cash in financing activities in fiscal  nearly the same in fiscal in the current year  approximately million was used to reduce bank borrowings  compared to million net of a million mortgage in the prior year 
we raised million from sales of stock to employees under various stock programs in the current year  compared to million last year 

table of contents 
index to financial statements as of august   we had approximately million of cash availability under our banking agreement based upon the borrowing base 
in addition  approximately million more may become available under our banking agreement if our borrowing base were to increase sufficiently to support increased borrowing 
we are not able to say when or if that will happen because of our inability to see very far into the future due to limited lead times on orders placed by our customers 
while we reported positive operating cash flows for the last thirteen quarters  a reduction in sales or gross margins could occur due to economic or other factors 
we believe that cash generated from operations  our cash balances and the amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months 
if for any reason these sources of funds are not sufficient to meet our requirements  we may be required to raise additional funds 
we cannot guarantee that we would be able to obtain additional financing or  if available  that it would be available to us on acceptable terms 
should that happen  there could be a significant adverse impact on our operations

index to financial statements stock options a stock option program description our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented personnel and align stockholder and employee interests 
we currently have four plans plan  plan  plan and director plan under which we grant stock options to employees  directors and consultants 
the options generally vest at a rate of one forty eighth each month beginning the first day of the month following the date of grant 
the exercise price of each option equals the market price of our stock on the date of grant and each option generally expires ten years after the date of grant 
the plan expired for future grants according to its terms in november the director plan expired for future grants according to its terms in april we currently account for our option plans under apb and  accordingly  do not recognize compensation expense for options granted to employees and directors 
options granted to consultants are accounted for under sfas and are valued using the black scholes model 
compensation expense of those options is recognized over the vesting life of the options  which is aligned with the consulting service life 
we also use the plan to grant restricted stock 
the grants are considered issued stock when granted and certificates are presented to the grantee as vesting occurs 
we record unearned compensation  valued using the black scholes model based on the share price on the date of grant  and expense that compensation over the vesting period

kansy jon prokop the percentage of total options granted to employees is based on an aggregate of  options granted to our employees  consultants and directors during the year ended august   including our named executive officers 
the exercise price per share of each option is equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
the potential realizable value is calculated based on the term of the option at its time of grant ten years 
it is calculated by assuming that the stock price on the date of grant appreciates at the indicated annual rate compounded annually for the entire term of the option  and that the option is exercised and sold on the last day of its term for the appreciated stock price 
no gain to the optionee is possible unless the stock price increases over the option term  which will benefit the stockholder

forward looking statements except for the historical information  this report contains numerous forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could and will differ materially from the statements and assumptions discussed in this report 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below  as well as those discussed in the sections entitled business  legal proceedings  selected financial data and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report 
this report and other presentations made by us contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
we believe that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions and our expectations at the time 
however  these statements involve uncertainties and are completely qualified by reference to several important factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the items listed below 
any and all of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements that we made the impact of competitive products and pricing 
we do business in extremely competitive markets that are noted for fierce competition and generally declining average selling prices 
most of our significant competitors are much larger and better financed than we are 
these competitors could 
table of contents 
index to financial statements execute sales strategies that could take a considerable amount of our business very quickly 
this could have a material adverse impact on both our sales and gross margins 
the timely development  acceptance and pricing of new products 
we have a large amount of continuing sales of older products that tend to decline in popularity and average selling price over time 
only by developing new products can we replace sales for declining products and partially offset the impact of lower average selling prices 
the impact of competing technologies including the obsolescence of existing products 
our business has a considerable amount of technological risk 
we are vulnerable to competitors that have much more resources than we do that are trying to develop products that are technologically superior to ours 
if customers believe those products are superior to ours  they may shift their purchases to them 
the ability to obtain production material and labor and capacity to meet product demand 
shortages could occur that make us unable to take advantage of a sudden increase or even stable level of demand 
the potential transition to value added products 
our historical base business is declining 
only by successfully developing and introducing value added products to our customers can we offset this impact 
the timely implementation of improved manufacturing processes 
we need to reduce our costs almost continually to offset the impacts of a reduction in our average selling prices 
we need to do this through continuous cost reduction in both our facilities and those of our contractors 
general economic conditions as they affect our customers and manufacturing contractors 
our customers and contractors do business in markets that are vulnerable to changes in economic conditions 
adverse economic conditions can adversely impact the demand and or the ability to supply our products 
the availability to obtain required financing on favorable terms 
if we have unanticipated difficulties  our banking relationships and other means of financing could be jeopardized 
general industry trends 
markets or customer preferences could move away from our products 
acts of war or terrorism as they affect us  our customers or our manufacturing partners 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement was made  and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement was made  nor will we necessarily make statements in advance to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors 
we cannot assess the impact of each new or old factor on our business 
we also cannot determine the extent to which a factor or combination of factors might cause future results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a significant portion of our products have a manufacturing process in foreign jurisdictions and are sold in foreign jurisdictions 
we manage our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations by denominating most transactions in us dollars 
however  we may facilitate a minor portion of our sales in euros 
we consider the amount of our foreign currency exchange rate risk to be immaterial as of august
