the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and item business 
overview our stated mission is to be the provider  employer and partner of choice 
we believe our attention to these three areas our patients  our teammates  and our business partners represent the major drivers of our long term success  aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns 
accordingly  two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover 
we have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes  which we refer to as the davita quality index dqi 
our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years  and we ended with the best clinical outcomes that we have ever achieved 
although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry  we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the united states 
over the past three years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover  which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements 
we will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers 
we are pleased with the overall clinical  operating and financial performance levels achieved over the past three years  and we expect to be able to generally maintain our current levels of performance over the foreseeable future  absent significant adverse shifts in government policy  physician practice patterns  or mix of commercial plan patients 
although our business has areas of significant potential exposure  as delineated in the risk factors following this discussion and analysis  our operating results over the past three years have not been significantly adversely affected by these risk factors 
our operations represent a single reporting segment  with more than of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis services  of which represents on site dialysis services in approximately centers that are wholly owned or majority owned 
our other direct dialysis services  which operationally are integrated with our center operations  relate to patient performed peritoneal dialysis and acute treatments in hospitals 
the principal drivers to our revenue are a the number of treatments  which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week  and b average treatment revenue 
the total patient base is a relatively stable factor  influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis  our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care  and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers 

table of contents our year over year treatment volume growth for was  compared with and for and approximately of our growth was associated with new centers  and approximately was attributable to increased treatments 
average revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government principally medicare and medicaid treatments  the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  commercial and government reimbursement rates  and our charge capture  billing and collecting operations performance 
on average  reimbursement rates from commercial payors are more than double medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates  and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment 
the percent of patients under government reimbursement programs to total dialysis center patients increased approximately during  and is currently approximately 
in terms of revenue dollars  approximately of our total dialysis revenue is from government programs 
government reimbursement rates are principally determined by federal medicare and state medicaid policy  have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of reductions 
medicare reimbursements represent approximately of our dialysis revenue  and cumulative increases since have only totaled 
there were no medicare rate increases for and  and the next increase is scheduled for at 
medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures  and some reductions are anticipated in certain states 
commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure 
over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining a relatively stable average reimbursement rate in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans  in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases 
approximately of our dialysis revenue is associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  and therefore changes in physician practice patterns  pharmaceutical protocols  and pharmaceutical intensities significantly influence our revenue levels 
such changes  driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes  have accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment over the past three years 
our operating performance with respect to services charge capture billing and collecting can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment is actually realized 
over the past two years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes to ensure reliable performance  as well as compliance with federal and state regulations 
because of the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting third party reimbursements in the healthcare industry  our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks 
our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgement as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date 
changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
in we separately reported cash recoveries of million associated with prior years dialysis services as a result of improvements in our billing and collecting operations 
our annual average revenue per treatment increased from in to in and to in these increases were principally due to increases in our standard fee schedules impacting non contracted commercial revenue  changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  commercial contract negotiations  and continued improvements in revenue capture  billing and collecting operations  while maintaining a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates 
the principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment  labor rates  vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals  and business infrastructure and compliance costs 
however  other cost categories can also 
table of contents represent significant cost changes such as increased insurance costs experienced in our average clinical hours per treatment has improved over the past two years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes 
there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in  and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels 
labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends 
for the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors  and expect relatively stable pricing through general and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenue over the past three years  however this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes  legal and other professional fees  and expanding support functions 
we expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be generally maintained to support our long term initiatives and to ensure the highest levels of regulatory compliance 
although other revenues represented only approximately of total revenues for and  changes in the status of disputed medicare billings at our florida lab resulted in increased current period revenue and operating income of million in compared to the carrier began making payments on medicare lab billings in the third quarter of after four years of withholding all payments  and therefore we were able to begin recognizing this revenue which was entirely incremental income because the associated lab revenue costs had always been ongoing 
medicare lab revenues for current year services amounted to million 
in addition to the incremental current period revenue and income  we had medicare lab recoveries totaling million in and associated with lab services provided from through  representing nearly of the previously disputed medicare claims 
outlook for and beyond 
we are targeting operating income to be between and million for  compared with for this is consistent with our current longer term three year outlook of an average annual increase in operating income of three to eight percent for the next three years on a cumulative average basis 
however  we believe the potential downside risks for this three year outlook are greater than the upside potentials outside this range 
these projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties  and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections 
these risks  among others  include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from ppo and private indemnity patients and from the administration of pharmaceuticals  possible reductions in private and government reimbursement rates  changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns or reimbursement policies  our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors  and legal compliance risks such as the ongoing review by the united states attorney s office and hhs office of inspector general in philadelphia 
we undertake no duty to update these projections  whether due to changes in current or expected trends  underlying market conditions  decisions of the united states attorney s office  the doj or the oig in any pending or future review of our business  or otherwise 

table of contents results of operations the following is a summary of operating revenues and operating expenses 
the divestiture of our dialysis operations outside the continental united states was substantially completed during  and the sale of our remaining non continental centers was completed during the second quarter of the non continental us operating results are excluded from the revenue and cost trends discussed below 
year ended december  dollar amounts rounded to nearest million net operating revenues continental current period services prior years services laboratory prior years services dialysis non continental operating expenses and charges continental patient care costs general and administrative depreciation and amortization goodwill amortization provision for uncollectible accounts recoveries minority interest and equity income  net non continental total operating expenses and charges operating income operating income excluding non continental operations  prior years recoveries  and goodwill amortization in ie  excluding amounts in italics dialysis treatments average dialysis treatments per treatment day average dialysis revenue per treatment excluding prior years services revenue in net operating revenues net operating revenues 
net operating revenues for current period services for continental us operations increased in both and approximately and of the increases in revenue for and were attributable to increases in the average reimbursement rate per treatment and approximately and were due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments 
the balance of the increase in was due to approximately million of additional current year medicare laboratory revenue 
as discussed below  we had not recognized any medicare laboratory revenue during due to the ongoing dispute with the third party carrier 
dialysis services revenue 
dialysis services revenue  excluding prior period services revenue  represented approximately  and of current operating revenues in  and  respectively 
lab  other and management fee income account for the balance of revenues 

table of contents dialysis services include outpatient center hemodialysis  which accounts for approximately of total dialysis treatments  home dialysis  and inpatient hemodialysis with contracted hospitals 
major components of dialysis revenue include the administration of epo and other drugs as part of the dialysis treatment  which represents approximately one third of operating revenues 
dialysis services are paid for primarily by medicare and state medicaid programs in accordance with rates established by cms  and by other third party payors such as hmos and health insurance carriers 
services provided to patients covered by third party insurance companies are on average more than double the medicare or medicaid rates 
patients covered by employer group health plans convert to medicare after a maximum of months 
as of year end  the medicare esrd dialysis treatment rates were between and per treatment  or an overall average of per treatment  excluding the administration of drugs 
the majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors  some of which pay at negotiated reimbursement rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule 
the commercial reimbursement rates are under continual pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large hmos and insurance carriers 
additionally  as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to medicare or medicaid coverage  the reimbursement rates generally decline substantially 
dialysis services revenues by payor type were as follows year ended december  percent of total dialysis revenue medicare medicaid and other government based programs commercial payors hmos  and health insurance carriers the average dialysis revenue recognized per treatment was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in average dialysis revenue per treatment in was principally due to commercial rate increases and changes in intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals 
the increase in was principally due to commercial rate increases  changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  continued improvements in revenue capture  billing and collecting operations  and payor contracting 
the average dialysis revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter of was our mix of commercial patients and commercial rates  which is a major profitability factor  remained relatively stable during the number of dialysis treatments increased in and in  principally attributable to non acquired annual growth rates of approximately plus growth through acquisitions 
we expect the non acquired growth rate to remain in the range of to through the prior years services revenue of million in related to cash recoveries associated with prior years services and resulted from improvements in the company s billing and collecting operations 
lab and other services 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contingencies  our florida based laboratory subsidiary has been under an ongoing third party carrier review for medicare reimbursement claims since prior to the third quarter  no medicare payments had been received since may following a favorable ruling by an administrative law judge in june relating to review periods from january to march  the carrier began releasing funds for lab services provided subsequent to may during the fourth quarter of  the carrier also released funds for certain claims in review periods from 
table of contents april through may during the second half of  the carrier paid us a total of million  representing approximately of the total outstanding prior medicare lab billings for the period from january through june approximately million of these collections related to lab services provided through june  and the balance of million related to prior years services 
in addition to the prior period claims  the carrier also began processing billings for current period services in the third quarter of  at which time we began recognizing current period medicare lab revenue 
the carrier s hearing officer recently rendered partially favorable decisions relating to review periods from april to may  which resulted in our recognition of additional recoveries of million  of which approximately million remains to be paid in the first quarter of we have filed requests for appeal to an administrative law judge for the remaining unpaid claims of approximately million for review periods from april through may  but cannot be assured of any further recoveries 
management fee income 
management fee income represented less than of total revenues for and our fees are typically based on a percentage of revenue of the center that we administrate and are established in the management contract 
we operated or provided administrative services to and third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of december  and during the third quarter of we acquired an outpatient vascular access management business that currently manages the vascular access component at fourteen independent third party physician practices 
operating expenses and charges patient care costs 
patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations and consist principally of labor  pharmaceuticals  medical supplies and facility costs 
as a percentage of net operating revenue  patient care costs were for and  and for on a per treatment basis  patient care costs increased approximately and in and the increase in both years was principally due to higher labor and insurance costs  and increases in new center openings  as well as increases in the levels of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals 
increases in revenue per treatment more than offset these cost increases 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and ancillary operations  and include expenses for corporate and regional administration  including centralized accounting  billing and cash collection functions  and regulatory compliance oversight 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues excluding prior period services revenue were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
in absolute dollars  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million in and an additional million in the increase in principally consisted of higher labor costs 
the increase in was principally due to higher labor and legal costs 
the substantial increases in labor costs for and principally related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes  as well as expanding support functions 
depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization from million in to million in was principally due to new center developments  acquisitions and our new operating and billing systems 
provision for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable excluding prior period services revenue were approximately of current operating revenues in and  and in during and  we realized recoveries of million and million associated with aged accounts receivables that had been reserved in the recoveries and lower provisions in and resulted from continued improvements that we have made in our billing and collecting processes 
impairments and valuation adjustments 
we perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment  amortizable intangibles  and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses 
table of contents whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted 
such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans  the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners  or when an owned or third party dialysis business experiences deteriorating operating performance or liquidity problems 
goodwill is routinely assessed for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies 
there were no significant impairments or valuation adjustments during the periods presented 
other income the net of other income items were income of approximately million for  million for  and million for these amounts included interest income of approximately million for each year 
debt expense and refinancing charges debt expense for  and consisted of interest expense of approximately million  million and million respectively  and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately million for each year 
the reduction in interest expense in was primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt balances 
reclassification of previously reported extraordinary losses 
in accordance with sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which became effective as of january   an after tax loss of million in and an after tax gain of million in resulting from the extinguishment of debt previously classified as extraordinary items have been reclassified to a pre tax refinancing charge of million for and a pre tax gain of million for in  the refinancing charges of million related to the consideration paid in excess of book value to redeem our convertible subordinated notes and the write off of deferred financing costs and financing fees associated with amending our bank credit agreement 
in  the refinancing charges of million  related to debt restructuring  which included retiring million senior subordinated notes due and extinguishing our then existing senior credit facilities 
in  the net refinancing gain of million related to the write off of deferred financing costs being more than offset by the accelerated recognition of deferred interest rate swap liquidation gains as a result of debt refinancing 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for represented an effective tax rate of  compared with in and in the reduction in the effective tax rate in compared to was primarily due to a lower provision for state income taxes and utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses 
the reduction in was primarily due to a lower provision for state income tax rates  the elimination of book amortization not deductible for tax purposes and changes in tax valuation estimates 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations during amounted to million  compared with million for not including million in medicare lab and uncollectible account recoveries related to prior years services 
non operating cash outflows in included million for capital asset expenditures including million for new center developments  million for acquisitions net of divestitures  and million in stock repurchases 
non operating cash outflows for included million for capital asset expenditures  million for acquisitions  and million in stock repurchases 
during we acquired dialysis centers  including controlling ownership interests in two centers in which we previously had minority ownership  for million and opened new dialysis centers 
other acquisitions related to ancillary operations 
during we acquired dialysis centers for million and opened new dialysis centers 
the accounts receivable balance at december  and represented approximately and days of net revenue  net of bad debt provision 

table of contents we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months 
our stated long term general target range for our debt leverage ratio is to  although we expect that it may be outside this range for periods of time 
as of year end  our ratio was for this purpose  debt leverage ratio is defined as total debt net of cash to annualized operating income excluding depreciation  amortization  and minority interests and equity income  net 
capital structure changes 
in the first quarter of  we borrowed million that was available under the term loan a of our credit facility 
the term loan a bears interest at libor plus for an overall effective rate of at december   with provision to potentially further reduce the interest rate to libor plus under certain circumstances 
the term loan a matures in march and requires annual principal payments of million in years and  million in and million in in july  we completed a call for redemption of all of our outstanding million convertible subordinated notes due holders of the notes had the option to convert their notes into shares of davita common stock at a price of per share or receive cash at times the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest 
in july  we issued  shares of common stock from treasury stock for the conversion of nearly all the notes  and redeemed the balance for cash and accrued interest 
in july  we also entered into an amended credit agreement in order to  among other things  lower the overall interest rate 
we also acquired an additional million of borrowings under the replacement term loan b  which amounted to billion 
in november  we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement in order to again lower the interest rate on the term loan b and to modify certain covenants 
the term loan b currently bears interest at libor plus for an overall effective rate of  with a provision to potentially further reduce the interest rate to libor plus under certain circumstances 
the aggregate annual principal payments for the term loan b are approximately million in the first four years of the agreement  million in the fifth year and million in the sixth year  due no later than march in august  we completed a call for redemption of million of our outstanding million convertible subordinated notes due holders of the notes had the option to convert their notes into shares of davita common stock at a price of per share or receive cash at times the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest 
all million of the notes were redeemed for million in cash plus accrued interest 
in october  we completed a call for redemption of the remaining million of our convertible subordinated notes due these notes were redeemed for million in cash  including accrued interest  and  shares of treasury stock 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the libor benchmark interest rate at on an amortizing notional amount of million of our term loan b outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at based upon the margin in effect on december  the agreement expires in november and requires quarterly interest payments 
as of december   the notional amount of the swap was approximately million and its fair value was a million liability  resulting in a charge to other comprehensive income of approximately million  net of tax 
as a result of the swap agreement  the effective interest rate on the entire credit facility was based upon the margin in effect on december  in january  we entered into another interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the libor benchmark interest rate at on an additional amortizing notional amount of million of our term loan b outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at based upon the margin in effect on january  the agreement expires in january and requires quarterly interest payments

during  we repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for approximately million  or an average of per share  pursuant to board of directors authorizations 
as of december   we had million remaining to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market pursuant to a million board of directors authorization 
capital structure changes 
in the first quarter of  we initiated a recapitalization plan to restructure our debt and repurchase common stock 
in the initial phase of the recapitalization plan we retired all of our million outstanding senior subordinated notes due for million 
concurrent with the retirement of this debt  we secured a new senior credit facility agreement in the amount of billion 
the excess of the consideration paid over the book value of the senior subordinated notes and write off of deferred financing costs associated with extinguishing the existing senior credit facilities and the notes resulted in refinancing charges of million 
we completed the next phase of the recapitalization plan with the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for approximately million  or per share  through a modified dutch auction tender offer 
from may through december we also purchased  shares in the open market for approximately million pursuant to a million board of directors authorization 
for the year ended december   stock repurchases  including  shares acquired prior to initiating the recapitalization plan  amounted to million for  shares  for a composite average of per share 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet  we have commitments associated with operating leases  letters of credit and our investments in third party dialysis businesses 
nearly all of our facilities are leased 
we have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers  in the form of put options exercisable at the third party owners discretion 
these put obligations require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow

in february the civil division of the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania in philadelphia contacted us and requested our cooperation in a review of some of our historical practices  including billing and other operating procedures and our financial relationships with physicians 
we cooperated in this review and provided the requested records to the united states attorney s office 
in may  we received a subpoena from the philadelphia office of the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  or oig 
the subpoena requires an update to the information we provided in our response to the february request  and also seeks a wide range of documents relating to pharmaceutical and other ancillary services provided to patients  including laboratory and other diagnostic testing services  as well as documents relating to our financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies 
the subpoena covers the period from may to may we have provided the documents requested 
this inquiry remains at an early stage 
as it proceeds  the government could expand its areas of concern 
if a court determines that there has been wrongdoing  the penalties under applicable statutes could be substantial 
in addition to the foregoing  we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of these additional pending proceedings  whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting estimates and judgements our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  liabilities  and contingencies 
all significant estimates  judgements and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary 
actual results will generally differ from these estimates 
changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods 
certain accounting estimates  including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts  impairments and valuation adjustments  and accounting for income taxes  are considered to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgements and estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts 
revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in the company s operations are addressed in aicpa statement of position sop no 
auditing health care third party revenues and related receivables 
as addressed in sop no 
 net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering  among other items  retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews  audits  billing reviews and other matters 
revenues are recognized as services are provided to patients 
operating revenues consist primarily of reimbursement for dialysis and ancillary services to patients 
a usual and customary fee schedule is maintained for our dialysis treatment and other patient services  however  actual collectible revenue is normally at a discount to the fee schedule 
medicare and medicaid programs are billed at pre determined net realizable rates per treatment that are established by statute or regulation 
most nongovernmental payors  including contracted managed care payors  are billed at our usual and customary rates  but a contractual allowance is recorded to adjust to the expected net realizable revenue for services provided 
contractual allowances along with provisions for uncollectible accounts are estimated based upon credit risks of third party payors  contractual terms  inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes  regulatory compliance issues and historical collection experience 
our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within of total revenue  which can represent as much as of operating income 
changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based on on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses 
for example  we recognized million of prior period dialysis revenue in related to cash recoveries in excess of previous estimates made possible by improvements in our billing and collecting operations 
lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received after considering possible retroactive adjustments that may be made as a result of the ongoing third party carrier review 
impairments of long lived assets 
we account for impairment of long lived assets  which include property and equipment  investments  amortizable intangible assets and goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  as applicable 
an impairment review is performed annually or whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable 
such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans  changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers 
we use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use 
such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized  as well as market values and conditions 
the computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions 
any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value 
accounting for income taxes 
we estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized 
deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgement about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets 
these calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgements because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable 

table of contents variable compensation accruals 
we estimate variable compensation accruals monthly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals 
our estimates  which include compensation incentives for bonuses  awards and benefit plan contributions  are updated periodically due to changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award 
actual results may vary due to the subjective nature of fulfilling employee specific and or corporate goals  as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by the company s board of directors

table of contents risk factors this form k contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including statements about our expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies for the future 
these forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for treatment growth rates  revenue per treatment  expense growth  levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable  operating income  cash flow  and capital expenditures 
we base our forward looking statements on information currently available to us  and we do not intend to update these statements  whether as a result of changes in underlying factors  new information  future events or other developments 
these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including risks resulting from economic and market conditions  the regulatory and reimbursement environment in which we operate  competitive activities and other business conditions 
our actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include those set forth below 
the risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business 
if the average rates that private payors pay us decline  then our revenues  cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced 
approximately of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have private payors as the primary payor 
the majority of these patients have insurance policies that reimburse us at rates materially higher than medicare rates 
based on our recent experience in negotiating with private payors  we believe that pressure from private payors to decrease the rates they pay us may increase 
if the average rates that private payors pay us decline significantly  it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  cash flows and earnings 
if the number of patients with higher paying commercial insurance declines  then our revenues  cash flows and earnings would be substantially reduced 
our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our reimbursements from higher paying commercial plans 
a patient s insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons  including as a result of changes in the patient s or a family member s employment status 
if there is a significant change in the number of patients under higher paying commercial plans relative to plans that pay at lower rates  for example a reduction in the average number of patients under indemnity and ppo plans compared with the average number of patients under hmo plans and government programs  it would negatively impact our revenues  cash flows and earnings 
changes in clinical practices and reimbursement rates or rules for epo and other drugs could substantially reduce our revenue and earnings 
the administration of epo and other drugs accounts for approximately one third of our net operating revenues 
changes in physician practice patterns and accepted clinical practices  changes in private and governmental reimbursement criteria  the introduction of new drugs and the conversion to alternate types of administration  for example from intravenous administration to subcutaneous or oral administration  that may in turn result in lower or less frequent dosages could materially reduce our revenues and earnings from the administration of epo and other drugs 
for example  some medicare fiscal intermediaries are seeking to implement local medical review policies for epo and vitamin d analogs that would effectively limit utilization of and reimbursement for these drugs 
cms had indicated that it may issue a new national coverage decision that will direct all fiscal intermediaries with respect to reimbursement coverage for epo 
we do not know if or when cms will issue such decision  or what it will provide 
in addition  reductions in current private and government reimbursement rates for epo or other pharmaceutical drugs would also reduce our net earnings and cash flows 
for example  both cms and members of congress have proposed changes in the medicare reimbursement rates for many of the outpatient prescription drugs that we administer to dialysis patients 

table of contents adverse developments with respect to epo could materially reduce our net earnings and cash flows and affect our ability to care for our patients 
amgen is the sole supplier of epo and often unilaterally increases its price for epo 
for example  amgen unilaterally increased its base price for epo by in each of  and although we have contracted coverage for epo pricing for a fixed time period that includes discount variables depending on certain clinical criteria  we cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the same discount structure for epo that we currently receive  or whether we will continue to achieve the same levels of discounts within that structure as we have historically achieved 
in addition  amgen has developed a new product  aranesp  that may replace epo or reduce its use with dialysis patients 
we cannot predict if or when aranesp will be introduced to the us dialysis market  what its cost and reimbursement structure will be  or how it may impact our revenues from epo 
increases in the cost of epo and the introduction of aranesp could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and cash flows 
future declines  or the lack of further increases  in medicare reimbursement rates would reduce our net earnings and cash flows 
approximately of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have medicare as their primary payor 
the medicare esrd program reimburses us for dialysis and ancillary services at fixed rates 
unlike most other medicare programs  the medicare esrd program does not provide for periodic inflation increases in reimbursement rates 
increases of in and in were the first increases in the composite rate since  and were significantly less than the cumulative rate of inflation since for through there has been no increase in the composite rate 
in an increase of only has been scheduled 
increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation  such as labor and supply costs  have occurred and are expected to continue to occur with or without a compensating increase in reimbursement rates 
we cannot predict with certainty the nature or extent of future rate changes  if any 
to the extent these rates are not adjusted to keep pace with inflation  our net earnings and cash flows would be adversely affected 
future changes in the structure of  and reimbursement rates under  the medicare esrd program could substantially reduce our operating earnings and cash flows 
cms is studying changes to the esrd program  including whether the medicare composite rate for dialysis should be modified to include additional services that are now separately billable  such as laboratory and other diagnostic tests and the administration of epo and other pharmaceuticals  in the composite rate 
if medicare began to include in its composite reimbursement rate any ancillary services that it currently reimburses separately  our revenue would decrease to the extent there was not a corresponding increase in that composite rate 
in particular  medicare revenue from epo is approximately of our total medicare revenue 
if epo were included in the composite rate  and if the rate were not increased sufficiently  our operating earnings and cash flow could decrease substantially 
future declines in medicaid reimbursement rates would reduce our net earnings and cash flows 
approximately of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have medicaid as their primary coverage 
in addition approximately of our dialysis revenues are from medicaid secondary coverage 
approximately of our medicaid revenue is derived from patients in california 
if state governments change medicaid programs or the rates paid by those programs for our services  then our revenue and earnings may decline 
some of the states medicaid programs have reduced rates for dialysis services  and others have proposed such reductions or other changes to eligibility for medicaid coverage 
any actions to limit medicaid coverage or further reduce reimbursement rates for dialysis and related services would adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
the pending federal reviews of some of our historical practices could result in substantial penalties against us 
we are voluntarily cooperating with the civil division of the united states attorney s office and oig in philadelphia in a review of some of our practices  including billing and other operating procedures  financial relationships with physicians and pharmaceutical companies  and the provision of pharmaceutical and other 
table of contents ancillary services 
the doj has also requested and received information regarding our laboratories 
we are unable to determine when these matters will be resolved  whether any additional areas of inquiry will be opened or any outcome of these matters  financial or otherwise 
any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us and exclusion from future participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
if we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business  we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenue and earnings 
our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local government regulations  including medicare and medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations  federal and state anti kickback laws  and federal and state laws regarding the collection  use and disclosure of patient health information 
the regulatory scrutiny of healthcare providers  including dialysis providers  has increased significantly in recent years 
in addition  the frequency and intensity of medicare certification surveys and inspections of dialysis centers have increased markedly since we endeavor to comply with all of the requirements for receiving medicare and medicaid reimbursement and to structure all of our relationships with referring physicians to comply with the anti kickback laws  however  the laws and regulations in this area are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
in addition  our historical dependence on manual processes that vary widely across our network of dialysis centers exposes us to greater risk of errors in billing and other business processes 
due to regulatory considerations unique to each of these states  all of our dialysis operations in new york and some of our dialysis operations in new jersey are conducted by privately owned companies to which we provide a broad range of administrative services 
these operations account for approximately of our dialysis revenues 
we believe that we have structured these operations to comply with the laws and regulations of these states  but we can give no assurances that they will not be challenged 
if any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations  we could suffer severe consequences  including mandated practice changes that significantly increase operating expenses  suspension of payments from government reimbursement programs  refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable reimbursement program requirements  loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government reimbursement programs  loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities in some of the states in which we operate  including the loss of revenues from operations in new york and new jersey conducted by privately owned companies as described above  fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations  submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and patient privacy law violations  and claims for monetary damages from patients who believe their protected health information has been used or disclosed in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws 
if businesses we acquire failed to adhere to regulations that apply to our business  we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues and earnings 
businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities  including for failure to adhere to laws and regulations governing dialysis operations 
we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire  but such liabilities may not be covered or may be greater than contractual limits or the financial resources of the indemnifying party 

table of contents if a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers  whether due to regulatory or other reasons  our revenue and earnings would decline 
if a significant number of physicians stop referring patients to our centers  it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
many physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical directors of the centers 
as a result  the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center 
if a medical director agreement terminates  whether before or at the end of its term  and a new medical director is appointed  it may negatively impact the former medical director s decision to treat his or her patients at our center 
additionally  both current and former medical directors have no obligation to refer their patients to our centers 
also  if quality or service levels at our centers deteriorate if may negatively impact patient referrals and treatment volumes 
our medical director contracts are for fixed periods  generally five to ten years 
medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us 
as of december   there were centers  accounting for nearly of our treatment volume  at which the medical director agreements required renewal on or before december  we also may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships in order to assure compliance with the safe harbor provisions of the anti kickback statute and other similar laws 
these actions could negatively impact physicians decisions to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us 
in addition  if the terms of an existing agreement were found to violate applicable laws  we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship  which could lead to the early termination of the agreement  or force the physician to stop referring patients to the centers 
if the current shortage of skilled clinical personnel continues  we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses 
we are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel 
we compete for nurses with hospitals and other health care providers 
this nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations 
if we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed  our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted 
provisions in our charter documents and compensation programs we have adopted may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests 
our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers  delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management  or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests 
these include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent  requiring days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our board of directors and granting our board of directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval  and a poison pill that would substantially dilute the interest sought by an acquirer that our board of directors does not approve 
in addition  most of our outstanding employee stock options include a provision accelerating the vesting of the options in the event of a change of control 
we have also adopted a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock options  which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control 
based on the shares of our common stock outstanding and the market price of our stock on december   these cash bonuses would total approximately million if a control transaction occurred at that price and our board of directors did not modify the program 
these compensation programs may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay 
these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our debt obligations  the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of december  for our debt obligations with variable interest rates  the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of these rates are based on libor plus margins based upon performance and leverage criteria 
the margins currently in effect are between to 
expected maturity date total fair value average interest rate thereafter dollars in millions long term debt fixed rate variable rate our senior credit facility is based on a floating libor interest rate plus a margin  which is reset periodically and can be locked in for a maximum of six months 
as a result  our interest expense is subject to fluctuations as libor interest rates change 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the libor benchmark interest rate at on an amortizing notional amount of million of our term loan b outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at based upon the margin in effect on december  the agreement expires in november and requires quarterly interest payments 
as of december   the notional amount of the swap was approximately million and its fair value was a million liability 
as a result of the swap agreement our overall effective interest rate on the entire credit facility was based upon the margin in effect on december  in january  we entered into another interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the libor benchmark interest rate at on an additional amortizing notional amount of million of our term loan b outstanding debt that had the economic effect of fixing the interest rate at based upon the margin in effect on january  the agreement expires in january and requires quarterly interest payments 
as a result of these two interest rate swap agreements  as of january   approximately of our outstanding variable rate debt is effectively fixed at a weighted average interest rate of and our overall credit facility effective weighted average interest rate was  based upon the current margins 
one means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points across all variable rate maturities referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve 
under this model  with all else constant  it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately million  million and million  net of tax  for the years ended december   and  respectively
