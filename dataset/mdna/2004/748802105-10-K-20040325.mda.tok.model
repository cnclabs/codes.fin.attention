item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview newspaper industry considerations our financial performance reflects  to a meaningful extent  conditions in the newspaper industry 
we believe that our customers spending for capital investment  and therefore  demand for our equipment  are affected by fluctuations in advertising revenue and newsprint cost 
specifically  we believe the growth in our business is somewhat reflective of the growth in newspaper advertising revenues  offset by any increases in newsprint costs 
similarly  we believe that a decline in advertising revenues generally will adversely affect capital equipment spending by newspapers and  as a result  will adversely affect our financial performance 
on a longer term basis  we believe that capital investment patterns have been  and will continue to be  affected by circulation trends  as well as consolidation of ownership and production facilities 
based on published financial reports and discussions with our customers  we believe that major newspaper chains generally derive over of their revenues from advertising 
published reports indicate that newspaper advertising revenues dropped precipitously in and the first six months of  we believe this decline had a direct adverse impact on capital spending by newspapers and  as a result  on our financial performance in those years and in the first half of while advertising revenues increased in  the increase was only as compared to  according to the newspaper association of america  which generally is below historical levels 
moreover  the increase is as compared to revenues  which  due to the revenue declines noted above  were at a depressed level 
based on public filings of financial reports of many newspaper chains  newsprint represents a significant operating expense for newspaper publishers 
according to published reports  newsprint costs were at their lowest level in nearly ten years 
therefore  we believe that while newsprint pricing concerns have adversely affected demand for our products in the past  they did not deter newspaper publishers from increasing capital spending for our products in  as described below 
despite the modest increase in advertising revenues in  our orders dramatically increased in the last half of the  in orders booked during the last half of exceeded the  in orders received in all of and was of the  in orders booked in we believe that the sharp increase in orders reflected pent up demand by newspaper publishers  who had deferred capital spending during the extended time period that adverse economic conditions affected the newspaper industry 
therefore  we expect that orders will return to a more sustainable growth pattern in on a longer term basis  management is focused on two trends  reduction in newspaper circulation and industry consolidation 
according to published reports  newspaper circulation in the united states has decreased an average of approximately each year from to with news and other information immediately available on competing media such as television  radio and the internet  we anticipate that this circulation trend will continue 
while reduced circulation could negatively affect demand for our products  we believe the consolidation of newspaper ownership in recent years may have a positive impact on our business 
in many cases  when large newspaper and media groups have acquired small newspapers and newspaper chains  the acquiring groups centralize the production and distribution of multiple newspapers located in a geographic area to one or a few sites 
the operation of centralized production and distribution facilities typically require the purchase of automated equipment 
therefore  consolidation could enhance demand for our products 
effect of contract terms on cash generation  revenue recognition most of our sales are made on a contract basis 
a typical sales contract requires a customer to pay for its purchase in installments as follows due at the time of the order  due days prior to shipment  due days prior to shipment  due upon installation and due upon acceptance 
while cash is collected throughout the order process  revenue is recognized only when all significant contract obligations are satisfied and collection of outstanding receivables are reasonably assured 
generally  revenue from equipment sales that require basic installation is recognized at the time of delivery  revenue from equipment sales requiring complex installations is recognized when installation is complete 
we normally receive larger orders several months in advance of delivery 
therefore  backlog can be an important  though by no means conclusive  indication of our short term revenue stream 
the timing of revenues can be affected by pending orders  the amount of custom engineering required  the timetable for delivery  the time required to complete installation and the receipt of new orders 
our backlog  as of december  and december   was  and  respectively 
we expect to ship all orders in our december  backlog within months 
results of operations vs 
net sales net sales for were  an increase of  from net sales of  we believe that our newspaper customers curtailed post press capital equipment purchases in due to a decline in advertising revenue during and the first half of published reports indicate that advertising revenues for newspapers have increased modestly beginning in the second half of and through  we believe that our sales reflect this growth 
in addition  we recognized sales totaling  from our new inserter product line obtained through the acquisition of assets from usa leader  inc gross profit gross profit for was  an increase of  from gross profit of  for the corresponding period in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in from in the improvement of gross profit as a percentage of sales was due in part to the allocation of fixed manufacturing overhead costs to a greater volume of production and shipments 
additionally  we incurred lower production and installation cost overruns in than in during the first six months of  we generated higher than expected costs from the production and installation on some larger custom orders 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of  as compared to  for the increase was due primarily to changes in allowance for doubtful accounts  incurrence of non recurring costs  and increase in selling  marketing and amortization costs 
we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  in  in contrast to a  reduction in allowance for doubtful accounts for the corresponding period in the net increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts was due to the deterioration of the financial condition of one of our customers  offset in part by collection of old accounts receivable balances that were previously reserved 
the reduction in the accounts receivable reserve in resulted from our collecting customer receivable balances that were previously reserved 
non recurring costs of approximately  related to a special meeting of shareholders held in response to the demand by a shareholder and professional fees associated with the implementation of a shareholder rights plan 
the remaining increase in selling general and administrative costs relate to marketing costs for our recently introduced in line and packman product lines  amortization expense relating to identifiable intangible assets from usa leader acquisition and higher variable selling expenses 
research and development research and development expenses for were  an increase of  as compared to  in in we devoted engineering and technical efforts to develop the quipp packman packaging system 
the majority of our research and development costs represented expenditures for the development of our stacker  a high resolution ink jet printer for our viper bottomwrapper product line and initiation of our quipp packman project 
other income and expense net other income and expense net in was  as compared to  for the same period in the decrease is primarily due to lower royalty income relating to our automatic cart loading system and lower interest rates on our securities available for sale 
additionally  in  we realized gains of  on the sale of securities 
results of operations vs 
net sales net sales for were  a decrease of  from net sales of  we believe that our net sales were adversely affected by the slowdown in the us economy and specifically a reduction in post press capital spending by newspaper industry publishers 
gross profit gross profit for was  a decrease of  as compared to gross profit of  for the corresponding period in the decrease in gross profit is primarily due to lower net sales 
additionally  our gross profit was affected by a higher percentage of fixed manufacturing overhead costs related to lower shipment volumes and by cost overruns resulting from higher than expected production and installation costs on some larger custom orders  these cost overruns declined during the course of the costs adversely affecting gross profit were offset in part by cost cutting measures  including workforce reductions  a two week plant shutdown  and four day work weeks from january to august selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for were  a decrease of  as compared to  for the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects non recurring costs generated in  changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts  and reduction in variable expenses offset in part by the write off of impaired goodwill 
during  we recorded non recurring charges of  with respect to efforts by the special committee of our board of directors to evaluate strategic alternatives for the company and with respect to compensation charges relating to our payment to several non executive employees of an amount equal to the excess of market value of shares of common stock underlying options surrendered by the employees over the exercise price of such options 
additionally  in  we recorded a net increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts of  based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts and the aging of our accounts receivable 
in contrast  we reduced our allowance for doubtful accounts by  during  because we collected customer receivable balances that were previously reserved 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was also affected by workforce reductions and lower variable selling expenses 
the reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses was partially offset by the write off of goodwill 
in  we amortized our goodwill asset by approximately  in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
our test of goodwill impairment included comparing the value of goodwill to projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average cost of funds 
as a result of our goodwill impairment test  we wrote off approximately  of goodwill in research and development research and development expenses for were  an increase of  as compared to  in the majority of our research and development costs represented expenditures for the development of our stacker  high resolution ink jet printer for our bottomwrapper product line and the quipp packman packaging system 
the majority of our research and development costs represented expenditures for improvements to the automatic palletizer system and development of the quipp gripp ii 
in  we focused much of our engineering and technical efforts on the custom design and production of customer orders 
costs related to these activities were charged to cost of goods sold as incurred 
other income and expense net other income and expense net in was  as compared to  for the same period in the decrease in other income and expense net is primarily due to the decrease in interest income 
the decrease in interest income resulted from lower interest rates and lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
the decrease was offset in part by gains on the sale of securities and an increase in royalty income relating to our automatic cart loading system technology 
liquidity and capital resources over the past several years  our cash generation has been more than sufficient to support our operations 
our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale increased by  and  in and  respectively 
furthermore  in we used approximately  for the acquisition of certain assets of usa leader  inc and related acquisition costs 
our long term debt consists solely of obligations under variable rate industrial revenue bonds that were issued through the dade county industrial development authority in at december   the balance due on the bonds was  of which  is classified as a current liability on our balance sheet 
during  the bonds bore interest at an average rate of 
the following table provides information relating to certain of our material contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years industrial revenue bonds     on december   cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale totaled  as compared to  at december  the increase was primarily due to cash provided by increased customer deposits deferred revenue and collection of accounts and notes receivable  offset in part by higher inventories and cash used for the acquisition of certain assets of usa leader  inc we received orders totaling  during the last six months of compared to  during the first six months of and  the last six months of the increased order level during the last six months of has resulted in higher deferred revenue and inventory balances at december  compared to december  working capital at december  was  a decrease of  from  at december  the deceased working capital is due primarily to acquisition costs relate primarily to the purchase of assets from usa leader  inc we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund operations at the current level 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change  and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance 
we discuss below the more significant estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
our senior management has discussed the application of these estimates with our audit committee 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy with regard to equipment sales requiring complex installation services calls for recognition when installation is complete 
because complex installations often require ongoing customer consultation even after a product is installed and is running  management must often make a judgment as to when an installation may be considered complete 
we believe that an installation generally is complete when our customers can use the equipment in their daily operations and collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
nevertheless  there is a degree of subjectivity involved in making this determination  which can affect the timing of recognition of revenues and the related cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
nevertheless  there is a risk that credit losses in the future will exceed our expectations  in which case our operating results would be adversely affected 
see the discussion under selling  general and administrative expenses for both vs 
and vs 
for additional information regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts 
warranty reserves we record a warranty reserve based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
while our warranty costs have generally been within our expectations and the provisions established  future returns or repair costs could be in excess of our warranty reserves 
additionally  we do not have extensive warranty claims experience with recently introduced products 
a significant increase in product return rates or a significant increase in the costs to repair our products would adversely affect our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize 
intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of usa leader  inc  we estimated the value of that company s patent  other technology and customer list  as well as non competition agreements we obtained as a part of this transaction 
because the value of these assets is not certain  there is a degree of subjectivity in allocating fair value to the assets 
the determination of fair value of the assets can have an impact on depreciation and amortization expense  because the useful lives of such assets vary from years to years 
moreover  in the event that the value of such assets are deemed to be impaired in the future  we would be required to charge the amount of the impairment to selling  general and administrative expenses 
market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because our cash and investments exceed short and long term debt  the exposure to interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
due to the short term maturities of our investments  we believe there is no significant risk arising from interest rate fluctuations 
to ensure safety and liquidity  we only invest in instruments with credit quality and which are traded in a secondary market 
the counterparties are major financial institutions and government agencies 
inflation the rate of inflation has not had a material impact on operations
