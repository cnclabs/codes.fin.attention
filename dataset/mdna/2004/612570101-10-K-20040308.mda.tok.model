item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and other information included in this report 
the financial results reported herein do not indicate the financial results that may be achieved by the company in any future period 
background monterey pasta company was incorporated in june as a producer and wholesaler of refrigerated gourmet pasta and sauces to restaurants and grocery stores in the monterey  california area 
the company has since expanded its operations to provide a variety of gourmet refrigerated food products to grocery and club stores throughout the united states  selected regions in canada  the caribbean  latin america  and asia pacific 
the company s overall strategic plan is to enhance the value of the monterey pasta company brand name by distributing its gourmet products through multiple channels of distribution 
the company s product distribution to grocery and club stores increased from approximately stores as of december  to approximately  stores by december  during recent years the company added profitable retail and club distribution through internal growth and through the frescala foods  nate s and emerald valley acquisitions 
on february   the company announced that approximately  wal mart supercenters discontinued it private label refrigerated pasta and pasta sauce program which the company was making since however  with the introduction of carb smart  low carbohydrate pasta products  the number of stores through which the company continues to distribute its products exceeds  total stores 
the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue will depend on five key factors whether grocery and club store chains will continue to increase the number of their stores offering the company s products  whether the company can continue to increase the number of grocery and club store chains offering its products  continued introduction of new products that meet consumer acceptance and whether the company can diversify into other complementary businesses through new product offerings or acquisitions and leverage its strengths to continue to grow revenues at levels attractive to its investors 
grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores  and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future or that such chains will not reduce the number of stores carrying the company s products 
during  costco chose to reduce the number of items it carries from many of its suppliers  which caused a reduction of sales from the company to costco 
the company believes that access to substantially greater capital resources  increased sales to offset the higher fixed overhead  coupled with continued reduction of its administrative and production costs as a percent of sales revenue  will be key requirements in the company s efforts to enhance its competitive position and increase its market penetration 
in order to support its expansion program  the company has developed  and is continuing to develop new products for consumers and revised advertising and promotional activities for its retail grocery and club store accounts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its net revenues from grocery and club stores 
because the company will continue to make expenditures associated with the expansion of its business  the company s results of operations may be affected 
operations for  and net revenues were   and  for  and  respectively  reflecting an annual increase in sales of for  when compared to  and a decrease for when compared to the change in net revenues is a result of shipping more less product and is not a result of price changes for the company s products 
the increase resulted from same store sales growth  increased store numbers in the grocery and club stores by year end of the acquisition of emerald valley kitchen in late august contributed approximately of the overall sales growth of from its eighteen weeks of sales through fiscal year end 
the sales decline of is a result a sales decline at costco of for the year 
at the beginning of  costco made a decision to reduce the number of items that it offers to its members  which caused a reduction in the number of items that the company sold to costco during costco s decision to reduce the number of items purchased from the company by approximately resulted in a reduction of sales to costco of  when comparing sales to the reduction in sales to costco is offset by an increase in retail sales of of which emerald valley kitchen sales represented of the increase 
on february  the company announced that approximately  wal mart supercenters discontinued its private label refrigerated pasta and pasta sauce program which the company was making since the company does not sell any other products to wal mart supercenters 
wal mart supercenter s private label business represented  and  of net sales in and respectively 
gross margin for   and was  and  respectively 
the slight increase in over was due to lower ingredient prices  especially dairy ingredients 
the gross profit decline in compared to was a function of increased fixed costs in anticipation of increased sales which have not grown at the level expected  increased costs involving the development and design of new packaging  and higher costs associated with the new packaging concept 
during  the company wrote off or charged to reserves  of obsolete packaging inventory 
in addition  the rapid rollout of the new package to the company s second largest club store customer  where the customer chose to deplete from its shelves the inventory of the old packaging before ordering product in the new packaging  caused expenses to exceed expectations 
this caused a dramatic slowdown in production followed by rapid production causing high expenditures all of which contributed to the decline in gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a increased to  in  up  or from  in  which had increased  or from sg a expense as a percent of net revenues was compared to in and in the increases in compared to are related to additional staffing in the sales and marketing area   increase increased freight cost due to fuel surcharges and less efficient loads related to increased retail sales   increase  and increased marketing and selling costs attributable to spending levels geared to higher sales growth expectation than was achieved during the year  increase 
demonstration costs as a percent of net sales are  and for the years   and respectively 
in light of the decrease in sales at costco  management is examining the level of product demonstration expenses to determine the most cost effective level relative to sales revenue management believes that the current level of sg a expenses is needed to support future sales growth depreciation and amortization expense  included in cost of sales and sg a with approximately in cost of sales  increased to  or of net revenues in  compared to  or of net revenues in  and  or in the increases over the past two years relate primarily to capacity expansion and equipment upgrades in the salinas  california production facilities and the addition of emerald valley kitchen businesses 
see liquidity  capital resources and business acquisitions  page depreciation increased by  in  to  from  and  in the increase is a result of depreciation related to the and asset additions 
amortization expense was  for   in  and  in the increase of  was related mainly to the emerald valley kitchen acquisition 
the decrease was associated with statement of financial accounting standards see new accounting pronouncements on page net interest income of  was recognized in compared to income of  in and  in the  and interest income was generated from investment in short term money funds from operating cash flow in the absence of bank debt 
at year end  the company had no bank debt 
see consolidated balance sheets page income tax benefit expense for   and was   and  respectively 
the expense resulted from a more normalized tax rate  since net operating loss carryforwards nols utilized in were not reserved 
thus  during  deferred tax assets were utilized to offset state and federal income tax with only  in cash taxes paid 
during  another  of the remaining reserves against deferred tax assets were released and offset against income tax since  after a comprehensive study of the nature of the nols and their likelihood of being utilized  management concluded that it was more likely than not that they would be utilized 
this benefit  together with permanent differences and other current tax effects resulted in a net income tax benefit of  for utilization of these nols and other deferred tax assets offset substantially all of the cash federal income taxes otherwise payable for the tax expense was  or of pre tax income 
additionally  the company realized additional tax benefits as a result of the exercise of non qualified stock options and the exercise and subsequent sale of certain incentive stock options or disqualifying dispositions in   and for financial reporting purposes  any resulting reduction in actual income tax obligations as a result of these disqualifying dispositions is credited to additional paid in capital

the reduction in cash provided by operations compared to is a result of lower net income 
the company currently has a credit facility  which was renegotiated in august and has been refined each year for million in aggregate borrowings which has been unused since september  and has a zero balance outstanding at december  see note to the financial statements 
the million working capital portion of the facility is priced at libor  plus basis points 
the working capital commitment expires october  the million non revolving term portion of the facility pricing is at either prime rate or libor plus premiums basis points over libor 
the term loan facility is subject to annual review if unused 
if used  it converts to an month term loan 
this access to capital provides the company with flexible working capital  which occasionally may be needed in the normal course of business  and the opportunity to grow the business through acquisitions or develop the existing infrastructure through capital investment 
a letter of credit in the amount of  was negotiated during january and increased to  in favor of an insurance company to support a deductible worker s compensation program initiated by the company on january  and continuing into in addition to operating cash flows  the company also received cash proceeds of   and  from the exercise of employee stock options and sales of stock under the company s stock purchase plan during   and  respectively 
cash balance at the end of was  compared with  the cash from operations in and cash balances from prior year was used primarily to purchase  of plant and equipment during the year 
in  the company added the ability to produce items in the rapidly growing prepared foods category  including a lasagna line and corresponding plant improvement to accommodate these new products 
also added were automated filling equipment that reduced operating costs of the company 
many other smaller projects were completed to support growth  improve processes  support administrative systems  or assist in compliance issues 
the cash from operations in  combined with the cash proceeds from stock sales and option exercises and accumulated cash balances  was used principally to fund million of plant expansion and improvement projects  and to fund the  in cash paid for the acquisition of the operating assets and inventory of emerald valley  and acquisition related costs of  the capital projects funded in included approximately million for a plant expansion at its distribution center 
other significant projects included a new jar line for sauce packing  a new chunky ravioli line  a new pasta packing line and labeler  a spiral chiller  and an electrical upgrade improved packaging equipment 
the company invested million in capital assets in major projects included approximately  for expansion of and improvements in the pizza calzone line  approximately  for ingredients blending upgrade  and over  for the borsellini dies and pasta machines 
the company also invested over  in facility improvements to enhance sanitation and support growth  and  in new or improved packaging equipment  as well as many other capital projects designed to support growth  improve processes  or assist in compliance issues 
the company anticipates capital expenditures in to be approximately million which is less than the million the company spent in the company does not plan further plant capacity expansion  which is the principal reason for the reduction in the capital required 
all future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with a combination of cash flow from operations or the use of the company s credit facility 
management believes that cash on hand of million at december   projected cash flows from operations  and availability under the credit facility  less the funds used to purchase an interest in cibo  is sufficient to fund working capital needs  anticipated capital expenditures  and future acquisitions 
during  the company invested cash on hand in highly liquid short term investments yielding approximately interest 
contractual obligations the company has no raw material contracts exceeding one year in duration 
however  it does have one long term contract with its liquid nitrogen provider  which expires november  in addition  the company leases production  warehouse and corporate office space as well as certain equipment under both a month to month and non cancelable operating lease agreement 
all building leases have renewal options and all include cost of living adjustments 
no employees have employment agreements

see note and to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding capitalized leases and operating leases 
business acquisitions on august   the company purchased the operating assets and inventory of emerald valley kitchen  inc a eugene  oregon based producer of organic fresh salsas  dips  hummus  and sauces with over retail chain distribution 
the company considered this purchase an opportunity to enter the rapidly growing organic food market 
the consideration to the sellers consisted of  in cash 
additionally  the emerald valley owners are eligible to receive an earn out based upon emerald valley earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda above predetermined levels starting at  for the first five years after the acquisition date 
in  the company paid  as a result of the earn out 
the earn out will be calculated annually at the end of successive twelve month periods following acquisition 
funding for the transaction came from existing cash balances 
no acquisitions occurred in  however  the company announced on january  the acquisition of an interest in cibo naturals llc cibo  a leading manufacturer of premium sauces and spreads located in seattle  washington 
the company paid cibo and its members million cash for of cibo and loaned cibo million 
additionally  the acquisition agreement provides for the purchase of the remaining ownership after four years at a predetermined calculation based on earnings before taxes 
the cash came partly from the company s cash balances and from its credit facilities 
cibo produces a variety of refrigerated gourmet sauces and spreads including fresh pesto sauces  flavored cheeses  bruschetta toppings and tapenade spreads 
their products are sold nationally through club stores  specialty food stores  and regionally in supermarket delis 
cibo fits well with the company s growth strategy in premium refrigerated foods 
cibo through its cibo naturals brand sells unique  high quality products and has developed a strong position in its markets which has great growth potential in both expanded distribution and in new products 
deferred tax assets due to the prior history of losses  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets have been provided in all years  as management could not determine that it was more likely than not that all of them could be used 
during  management completed a comprehensive study of the nature of certain nols arising in connection with previously owned subsidiary upscale food outlets  inc ufo and their likelihood of their being utilized 
management concluded that it was more likely than not that they would be utilized 
as a result  reserves against these specific deferred tax assets totaling  were released during and offset against income tax expense 
this credit  together with permanent differences and other current tax effects resulted in an income tax benefit of  for in tax expense was  which approaches a more normalized tax rate 
as of december   remaining net deferred tax assets available to offset future cash taxes are  short term and  long term 
as a result of this evaluation and resulting release of reserves and the company continuing to be profitable  the company expects that future income tax expense will be accrued at a more normalized combined federal and state rate approaching statutory rates less certain tax credits and timing differences 
the future disallowance of any previous ufo nol usage  if it occurs  would increase both income tax expense and amounts actually payable 
sales and marketing the company s sales and marketing strategy is twofold  and targets sustainable growth in distribution of its products and the introduction of innovative new products to keep the company positioned as the gourmet refrigerated category leader in the marketplace 
its focus is on increasing sales through expansion of its club store and retail grocery business 
expansion of the company s club store business took on an international flavor during with the introduction of the company s products into the eastern canada division of costco  as well as costco locations in mexico  and in asia 
the company s products are now found in approximately costco wholesale locations 
distribution of the company s products also continues to grow with the national expansion of sam s club  and the introduction of the company s products into sam s club locations in mexico 
monterey pasta s products are now found in approximately sam s club locations 
during  the company s retail business increased significantly with an additional albertson s stores including in the metro phoenix market  and in northern california  over dominick s stores in the metro chicago market  and jerry s enterprises stores in the upper midwest  which average  square feet in size 
the company also acquired significant retail business with its purchase of the nate s polenta brand in late the nate s polenta business added distribution to over retail outlets 
at end of  the company had distribution in over  retail outlets 
in  the company continued its emphasis on bringing innovative new products to the marketplace with the introduction of two new product lines veil thin pasta and italian classic sauces 
veil thin pasta features a delicate dough that is significantly thinner than traditional refrigerated pasta doughs 
the company s first offering in the veil thin line is its borsellini  which wraps gourmet fillings in small pouches of veil thin dough 
the product line has enjoyed considerable success in both retail and club store accounts 
the italian classics sauce line expands the company s sauce offerings  and features three varieties of traditional style italian sauces 
italian classics sauces can be found in both retail and club store accounts 
in addition  the company also added significantly to its existing line of refrigerated  fresh calzones during the year  and was successful in introducing them to both retail and club store accounts 
during the company launched three new product lines stuffed potato gnocchi with three flavors  a new line of premium sauces in plastic jars with several selections and pezzo grandi chunky stuffed ravioli with three flavors initially 
several extensions of existing lines were also marketed 
the company made significant distribution gains during with over albertson s stores   wal mart supercenters  bj s club stores and publix super markets added to its distribution base 
the emerald valley acquisition also added over stores not formerly served by the company 
the company purchased the operating assets of emerald valley kitchen of eugene  oregon  a producer of refrigerated organic salsas  dips  hummus and sauces 
the august acquisition marked the company s formal expansion into the rapidly growing organic food business and will be used as a platform for additional offerings in the future 
in  the company focused on revitalizing its products and the packaging of its products and introducing new products to accommodate the changing lifestyles of consumers 
pasta is a staple of the north american diet 
it is widely recognized that pasta is a convenient and nutritious food 
the usda places pasta on the foundation level of its pyramid of recommended food groups and pasta supports consumers lifestyle demands for convenient at home meals 
in  the company relaunched its retail gourmet refrigerated pasta and sauce lines with improved formulations and innovative new packaging 
the company s signature products have been updated with new doughs and fillings 
the distinctive new packaging uses a sleeve to wrap the inner package  and incorporates color graphics and product photography in a contemporary new look 
the new dough is made from extra fancy durum flour and whole eggs  which gives the pasta a classic appearance and richer flavor as well as a noticeably improved al dente or firm texture 
this also gave the company the opportunity to refine several of its ravioli and tortelloni fillings 
these improvements include creamier textures and enhanced flavors 
the package is the company s most important point of communication with the consumer  and the package has been redesigned with the consumer in mind 
the photography emphasizes appetite appeal  and the package highlights key product benefits to the consumer to generate point of sale purchases 
this new package is designed to both strengthen the monterey pasta company brand recognition and reinforce its positioning as a premium quality product 
in  the company introduced carb smart  a line of reduced carbohydrate fresh pastas  sauces and prepared entrees with about half the carbohydrates of regular pasta 
seven carb smart items are now shipping to supermarkets and club stores nation wide including three ravioli varieties spinach ricotta  four cheese chive  and seafood as well as spinach cheese tortelloni  classic egg linguine  and classic egg fettuccine 
carb smart four cheese sauce  with genuine gorgonzola  asiago  swiss and fontina cheeses  is the low carbohydrate companion to the pasta line 
the company is responding to the low carbohydrate diet trend by delivering the flavor and convenience of traditional fresh pasta 
in addition  the company is currently introducing additional quick preparation entrees under both the carb smart and the monterey pasta brands 
these items include seafood lasagna  cheese manicotti  chicken cannelloni  and additional varieties of lasagna 
business risks certain characteristics and dynamics of the company s business and of financial markets generally create risks to the company s long term success and to predictable quarterly results 
these risks include no assurance of continued profitability 
in the second quarter of  the company reported its first operating loss from continuing operations 
subsequent to that quarter the company incurred losses through the first quarter of  after which it regained profitability  which continued through twenty five consecutive quarters until losses were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of at december  the company had an accumulated deficit of  there can be no assurance that the company will generate profits in the short or long term 
liquidity need for additional capital 
management believes that its current cash balances  operations  and existing bank lines of credit will provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s planned capital and operating requirements for normal operations and capital expenditures through the next twelve months 
see note to the financial statements for a description of the credit facility 
the use of the ufo nols through is approximately million 
if the company s operations do not provide cash sufficient to fund its operations  and the company seeks outside financing  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing when needed  on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  any future equity financing or convertible debt financing could cause the company s stockholders to incur dilution in net tangible book value per share of common stock 
hiring and retention of key personnel 
the success of the company depends on its ability to retain key executives  and to motivate and retain other key employees and officers 
on october   mr 
stephen l 
brinkman announced his resignation as the company s chief financial officer 
scott wheeler  the current corporate controller was named as chief financial officer effective october  the company currently has a key man insurance policy with a face amount of  for james williams  president and ceo 
there can be no assurance that significant management turnover will not occur in the future  which could disrupt the company s operations  and business may suffer as a result 
impact of inflation 
dairy ingredients had a material inflationary impact on the company s operations during  but did not have an impact during or freight rate increases related to fuel surcharges impacted by approximately  when compared with the same period in substantial increases in labor  employee benefits  freight  ingredients and packaging  rents and other operating expenses  as well as increases in dairy ingredients could adversely affect the operations of the company s business in future periods 
the company cannot predict whether such increases will occur in the future  or their magnitude 
risks inherent in food production 
the company faces all of the risks inherent in the production and distribution of refrigerated food products  including contamination  adulteration  and spoilage  and the associated risks of product liability litigation  which may be associated with even an isolated event 
although the company has modern production facilities  it employs what it believes are the necessary processes and equipment in order to insure food safety  and has obtained usda approval for its california production facilities  there can be no assurance that the company s procedures will be adequate to prevent the occurrence of such events 
dependence on major customers 
during  two of the company s customers  costco and wal mart  inc including its subsidiary  sam s club  accounted for and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
the company currently sells its products to eight separate costco regions which currently make purchasing decisions independently of one another 
these regions re evaluate  on a regular basis  the products carried in their stores 
there can be no assurance that these costco regions will continue to offer monterey pasta products in the future or continue to allocate monterey pasta the same amount of shelf space 
for  the company supplied its products to sam s club stores  and  wal mart supercenters and neighborhood markets 
on february  the company announced that wal mart supercenters discontinued its private label refrigerated pasta and pasta sauce program 
the company does not sell any other products to wal mart supercenters 
during the company sold  to wal mart supercenters 
there can be no assurance that sam s club will continue to carry its products 
loss of either of these customers  costco or sam s club  or a significant reduction in sales to either  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
additionally  liberalized pricing or allowance terms would create downward pressure on gross margins 
changing consumer preferences 
consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of the company s food products depends on the company s ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and offer products that appeal to their preferences 
the company introduces new products and improved products and incurs development and marketing costs associated with new products 
if the company s products fail to meet consumer preferences  then the company s strategy to grow sales and profits with new products will be less successful 
recent attention to low carbohydrate diets by certain segments of the us population has impacted the consumption of pasta  and as a percent of grocery sales in the us pasta sales have declined 
as american consumers seek new ways to reduce their intake of carbohydrates  monterey pasta company has developed products to address these changing preferences 
however  there can be no assurance that these new products will meet the changing demands of the consumer 
seasonality and quarterly results 
the company s grocery and club store accounts are expected to experience seasonal fluctuations to some extent 
the company s business in general may also be affected by a variety of other factors  including but not limited to general economic trends  competition  marketing programs  and special or unusual events 
competition and dependence on common carriers 
the company s business continues to be dominated by several very large competitors  who have significantly greater resources than the company  such competitors can outspend the company and negatively affect the company s market share and results of operations 
the company also continues to be dependent on common carriers to distribute its products 
any disruption in its distribution system or increase in the costs thereof could have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
california energy supply and pricing 
during  california experienced an energy crisis that increased the company s energy expenses and could have disrupted the company s operations 
in the event of an acute power shortage  when power reserves for california fall below  electricity providers have on some occasions implemented  and may in the future implement  rolling blackouts 
if blackouts interrupt the power supply to the company s production facilities  such facilities would temporarily be unable to continue production 
any such interruption could result in a loss of revenue as a result of reduced production and spoilage of food products 
in addition  related to the energy crisis  many of the electricity and natural gas suppliers raised their rates substantially during the first six months of because the company has most of its operations in california  its operating costs are affected by an increase in electricity and natural gas prices 
as a result  the company s operating results could be affected in some measure in the future by fluctuations in the price or supply of energy 
electricity prices are similar to the same period a year ago 
natural gas prices have progressively increased during and prices on average for the year are higher than the average for the prior year 
this impacted operating cost by approximately  during management cannot predict the level of future energy prices or supply with certainty 
volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated substantially since the initial public offering of the company s common stock in december such volatility may  in part  be attributable to the company s operating results or to changes in the direction of the company s expansion efforts 
in addition  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets or the food industry  natural disasters or other developments affecting the company or its competitors could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies  including the company  for reasons sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
any shortfall in the company s net sales or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts or the market could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter 
this could result in an even more immediate and significant adverse impact on the trading price of the company s common stock upon announcement of the shortfall or quarterly operating results 
marketing and sales risks 
the future success of the company s efforts will depend on a number of factors  including whether grocery and club store chains will continue to expand the number of their individual stores offering the company s products and whether allowances and other incentives will expand retail distribution 
expansion into new markets increases the risk of significant product returns resulting from the company s supply of slower selling items to its customers 
in addition  grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future  either in the same measure or at all 
should these channels choose to reduce or eliminate products  the company could experience a significant reduction in its product sales 
the company remains dependent on the use of slotting allowances and other incentives to expand retail distribution 
dairy ingredients prices 
during the first ten months of average price of certain dairy ingredients increased over compared with the average of the prior twelve months  as measured by butterfat prices published by the state of california department of food and agriculture 
because the company utilizes various dairy ingredients in many of its products  its operating costs will be affected by an increase in the price of those ingredients 
the company s operating results were affected in the first eleven months of although dairy ingredient prices have declined significantly since november  they have started to increase in the third quarter  but have not as yet materially impacted operating margins 
continued increases in dairy prices  if they occur  will have a negative impact on operating results in the future 
dairy ingredients historically tend to be cyclical in nature and subject to declines in price as well as increases 
management cannot predict with certainty the duration or magnitude of the current price cycle 
compliance with laws applicable to its business 
the company s facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture  the federal food and drug administration  and other federal  state  local  and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing  packaging  storage  distribution  advertising  labeling  quality  and safety of food products 
the company s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to administrative penalties and injunctive relief  civil remedies  including fines  injunctions and recalls of its products 
failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences  including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity 
deductible worker s compensation program 
the company entered into a deductible worker s compensation program for fiscal year and will continue the program into this program  which features a fixed annual payment  a deductible of  per occurrence  and a  letter of credit in favor of the insurance company  creates a maximum exposure of approximately million for claims reported in a competitive guaranteed cost program would have cost the company approximately million 
management believes that its current safety program and its safety record will provide the foundation to enable the company to realize the premium savings deductible programs are designed to achieve 
the company s maximum additional exposure in the event of adverse experience is approximately  the maximum potential reduction of expense from the proposed guaranteed cost program is as much as million 
during the company recorded total workers compensation expense of  saving the company approximately  over the guaranteed cost program 
there can be no assurances that these savings will continue 
critical accounting policies and management judgments accounts receivable and allowances the company provides allowances for estimated credit losses  product returns  spoilage  and adjustments at a level deemed appropriate to adequately provide for known and inherent risks related to such amounts 
the allowances are based on reviews of loss  return  spoilage  adjustment history  contractual relationships with customers  current economic conditions  and other factors that deserve recognition in estimating potential losses 
while management uses the best information available in making its determination  the ultimate recovery of recorded accounts  notes  and other receivables is also dependent on future economic and other conditions that may be beyond management s control 
sales incentives and advertising costs the company expenses advertising costs as incurred or when the related campaign commences whichever comes first 
sales incentives paid or credited to club stores and grocery chains for shelf space allocations are amortized between six and twelve months depending on the nature of the chain program or agreement 
the company did not pay any sales incentives in order to obtain the wal mart private label business and therefore was not required to accelerate the expensing of these incentives 
sales incentives are used to attract new customers or to increase volume 
loss of a major account could create the need to expense the remaining prepaid asset relating to that account in a specific quarter  thereby potentially affecting the results of that quarter 
in addition  sales incentives could increase thereby adversely affecting gross margins 
goodwill intangible assets intangible assets  other than goodwill  consist of trade names and other intangibles and are recorded at cost  net of accumulated amortization 
these intangibles are amortized over their respective useful lives  if determinate  ranging from three to ten years 
goodwill and intangibles with indeterminate useful lives are assessed for impairment at least annually 
the valuation of these intangibles is generally determined based upon valuations performed by third party specialists and management s best estimates of fair value 
as a result  the ultimate value and recoverability of these assets is subject to the validity of the assumptions used 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled million at december  however  the current fair market value of acquired assets is in excess of carrying values and  accordingly  management believes that only significant changes in cash flow assumptions would result in impairment 
income taxes the company accounts for corporate income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach 
this approach results in the recognition of deferred tax assets future tax benefits and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary timing differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance to the extent of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company has significant deferred tax assets  which include significant amounts of nols from the company s former restaurant operating subsidiary ufo 
these nols were previously fully reserved based upon management s best estimate of ultimate realizeability 
during  based upon new evidence and management s judgments these reserves were substantially reduced 
the amount of the reserve is significantly dependent on management s assumptions regarding future taxable income and the availability of these nols to offset future taxable income 
the effect on the company s net income is significant whenever the estimate of realizeability changes  as it did in the company expects to utilize most of the remaining nols in fiscal year and recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires the consolidation of certain special purpose or variable interest entities 
fin no 
is applicable to financial statements issued after  however  disclosures are required currently if the company expects to consolidate any variable interest entities 
the company has no variable interest entities and therefore  there are no entities that will be consolidated with the company s financial statements as a result of fin no 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity which establishes standards for how an issuer of financial instruments classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances if  at inception  the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on a fixed monetary amount known at inception  variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer s equity shares or variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer s equity shares 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations
