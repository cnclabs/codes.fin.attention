overview 
we produce and sell pulverized limestone  quicklime and hydrated lime 
the principal factors affecting our success are the level of demand for our products  and whether we are able to maintain sufficient production levels and product quality while controlling costs 
inclement weather conditions generally reduce the demand for lime and limestone products supplied to construction related customers that account for a significant amount of our revenues 
inclement weather also interferes with our open pit mining operations and can disrupt our plant production  as in the case of flooding and winter ice storms in texas in recent years 
demand for our products in our market areas is also affected by general economic conditions  the pace of home construction and the demand for steel  as well as the level of governmental funding for highway construction 
in recent years  the demand and prices for lime and limestone products have been improving 
the transportation equity act for the st century signed into law in l and originally scheduled to expire in september has been extended and continues to provide federal funding for highway construction 
new six year bills have been proposed by congress and the administration that would increase the funding levels by to 
due to wide bi partisan support  a new bill is expected to pass  therefore  we believe there will be a continuing strong level of demand for lime and limestone products used in highway construction for the next few years 
our recent modernization and expansion projects in texas and arkansas have positioned us to meet the demand for high quality lime and limestone products in our markets  with our lime out put capacity nearly doubling since these projects have also equipped us with up to date  fuel efficient plant facilities  which should result in lower production costs and greater operating efficiencies  thus enhancing our competitive position 
in order for our plants to operate at peak efficiency  we must meet operational challenges  such as those that we confronted at texas in the middle of  that arise from time to time  including bringing new facilities on line as well as operating existing facilities 
our primary variable cost is energy 
in recent years  we have faced increased natural gas cost 
we have been able to mitigate to some degree the adverse impact of those increases by varying the mixes of fuel used in our kilns  and by passing on some of our increased energy costs to our customers through surcharges on certain products 
we have not  to date  engaged in any significant hedging activity in an effort to control our energy costs 
we have  however  recently entered into forward purchase contracts for natural gas for the winter months  in order to provide greater predictability to this important cost component  and we may do so again in the future 
we financed our texas and arkansas modernization and expansion projects through a combination of working capital  a common stock rights offering to our shareholders and debt financing  including the issuance of  unsecured subordinate notes in august given our increased level of debt  we must generate 
table of contents sufficient cash flow to cover ongoing capital and debt service needs 
all of our long term debt becomes due in and  and we will need to refinance our debt prior to maturity 
with the second kiln and related storage capacity at arkansas substantially completed  and the shreveport  louisiana distribution terminal currently expected to be refurbished during  we will have completed phase ii of our arkansas modernization and expansion project 
as a result of our texas and arkansas projects  our yearly depreciation  depletion and amortization expense included in cost of revenues has increased from  in to  in in addition  over that period  our interest expense has increased from  in to  in excluding  of interest capitalized in  as the amount of our borrowings has increased 
in order for us to increase our profitability in the face of these increased fixed costs  we must grow our revenues and cash flow and continue to control our operational and selling  general and administrative expenses  including new corporate governance compliance costs resulting from the sarbanes oxley act of and associated regulatory requirements 
our new capacity at arkansas affords us the best opportunity to increase sales 
we believe that the enhanced production capacity resulting from our modernization and expansion efforts at the texas and arkansas plants and the operational strategies that we have implemented will allow us to increase production  improve product quality  better serve existing customers  attract new customers and control our costs 
there can be no assurance  however  that demand and prices for our lime and limestone products will remain strong  that we will be successful in selling out our substantial additional new capacity at arkansas  that our production will not be adversely affected by weather related or other operational problems  that our results will not be adversely affected by continued increases in energy costs or that we will be able to successfully refinance our long term debt at acceptable interest rates before it becomes due 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities  at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant management judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant management judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets 
we review long term assets for impairment in accordance with the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that  when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we should determine if impairment of value exists 
if the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment exists and an impairment loss must be calculated and recorded 
if an impairment exists  the impairment loss is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s fair value 
any impairment loss is treated as a permanent reduction in the carrying value of the asset 
deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that deferred tax assets would be realizable in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
conversely  should we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would not be realizable in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies 
we are party to proceedings  lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business relating to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to estimate the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue  including coverage under our insurance policies 
this determination may change in the future because of new developments 

table of contents pension plan 
we have one noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
all benefits for participants in the plan were frozen as of july  our costs  credits and funded status for this plan are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and expected long term return on plan assets 
future costs  credits and funded status for this plan may change should conditions warrant changes in the assumptions 
results of operations

on january   we announced that we had discovered that an employee who had recently left the company may have improperly diverted company funds without authorization 
trading in the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market nasdaq was halted  and the audit committee of the company s board of directors retained outside counsel to conduct a special investigation into the matter 
the audit committee also retained an independent accounting firm to review our internal controls and to make recommendations for improvement that we implemented 
we also contacted the securities and exchange commission the sec  as well as criminal authorities  and cooperated with the sec  nasdaq and criminal authorities with respect to their investigations into this matter 
the company s former vice president finance  controller  treasurer and secretary  larry ohms the former vp finance  over a period of four years beginning in  embezzled approximately  from the company 
the former vp finance voluntarily resigned from the company on january   approximately one week before we discovered the defalcations 
the former vp finance has stated that no one else at the company was involved in perpetrating the embezzlements 
from the results of the special investigation and the former vp finance s testimony  we believe this statement to be accurate 
in  the former vp finance pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of making a false statement to the sec  and on march  was sentenced to a term in federal prison and ordered to pay  in restitution to the company 
on march   we received  in insurance proceeds from our insurance policies covering employee theft 
the  was recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at december  in prepaid expenses and other assets  and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in other income in the fourth quarter in addition  we retained counsel for assistance in its efforts to recover the embezzled funds from the former vp finance  and to pursue possible civil actions on behalf of the company against third parties 
we filed suit against the former vp finance and obtained a judgment against him  including compensatory and punitive damages 
the former vp finance has claimed not to have any funds 

table of contents recoveries were recognized in the quarters in which the recoveries were realized  and the costs of our special investigation  cooperation with the sec  nasdaq and criminal authorities in their investigations and ongoing recovery efforts were expensed as incurred 
during  we recorded recoveries of  net of income taxes  gross  and embezzlement related costs of  net of income tax benefits  gross  compared to embezzlement related costs of  net of income tax benefits  gross  in we do not anticipate any future material embezzlement related costs or recoveries 
vs 
revenues increased to  in from  in  an increase of  or 
the increases in revenues for primarily resulted from increased lime and pulverized limestone pls sales at the texas and colorado plants 
gross profit was  for  compared to  in  a increase 
gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared to in these increases are primarily due to the resolution of operational problems at the texas plant that occurred during the second and third quarter and the increase in pls sales volume 
these improvements were partially offset in by increased natural gas costs and a winter ice storm in texas that caused the loss of approximately two days of sales and a natural gas curtailment to the texas plant that resulted in reduced production levels during the first quarter the total negative price variance for natural gas in compared to was approximately  partially offset by natural gas surcharges on pls products implemented in early march since that time  the surcharges have offset most of the increased natural gas costs 
although natural gas prices have declined from their highs in the first quarter  they continued to exceed price levels during the remainder of we expect natural gas prices to continue to exceed prices 
therefore  we have recently increased the sales prices on pls products by amounts approximating the natural gas surcharges 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased by  or  to  in  compared to  in as a percentage of sales  sg a declined to in from in the increase in sg a for was primarily attributable to increases in insurance costs  salaries and employee benefits 
interest expense in increased  or  to  compared to  in the increase in interest expense in primarily resulted from the private placement of  of unsecured subordinated notes the sub notes  partially offset by  of net repayments of other outstanding debt during approximately  of interest was capitalized in as part of the arkansas phase ii expansion project

revenues decreased to  in from  in  a decrease of  or 
this primarily resulted from a decrease in sales volume in compared to the decrease in revenues primarily resulted from a reduction in texas highway construction work in compared to and operational problems at the texas plant in june  july and august  partially offset by increased lime sales at the arkansas plant 
gross profit was  for  compared to  in  a decrease 
gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues for decreased to from in the decrease in gross profit 
table of contents and gross profit margin during was primarily due to a  increase in depreciation expense and reduced production at the texas plant in june  july and august due to operational problems  partially the result of unseasonably wet weather 
these were partially offset by increased production and sales at the arkansas plant 
the increase in depreciation primarily resulted from a full year s depreciation in on the arkansas phase i modernization and expansion  compared to eight months of depreciation in after phase i was completed 
the reduced production at the texas plant in resulted in the depletion of finished goods inventories and increased costs through the purchase of lime from alternative sources to fulfill some sales commitments 
gross profit margin in was also negatively impacted in the fourth quarter by increased natural gas prices

capital requirements 
we require capital primarily for our operating costs  seasonal working capital needs  normal recurring capital and re equipping projects and expansion projects 
our capital needs are met principally from cash flow from operations  our  revolving credit facility and our long term debt 
cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in  compared to  in the  improvement in was primarily the result of the  increase in net income  partially offset by changes in working capital 
the most significant changes in working capital resulted from a  increase in accounts receivable in  compared to a  decrease in the increase in accounts receivable primarily resulted from a  increase in revenues in the fourth quarter compared to the comparable quarter 
the  cash flow resulting from the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets in was primarily due to the  in insurance proceeds received in march accounts payable and accrued expenses increased  excluding approximately  of accounts payable and accrued expenses at december  for the arkansas phase ii expansion project during primarily due to increased accruals of income taxes and bonuses 
banking facilities  debt and rights offering 
on april   we entered into a credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks for a  senior secured term loan the loan 
the loan is repayable over a period of approximately eight years  maturing on march   and requires monthly principal payments of  which began april   with a final principal payment of  on march   which equates to a year amortization 
we paid a fee equivalent to of the loan value to the placement agent 
the interest rate on the first  of the loan is 
the subsequent installments bear interest from the date they were funded at above the secondary market yield of the united states treasury obligation maturing may  the blended rate for the additional  is 
the loan is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets  with the exception of accounts receivable and inventories which secure the  revolving credit facility 
the loan agreement contains covenants that restrict the incurrence of debt  guaranties and liens  and places certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and the sale of significant assets 
we are required to meet minimum debt service coverage ratios on an ongoing basis and maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth 

table of contents on january   the maturity of the  revolving credit facility that we had at that time was extended to july  from january  through march   that revolving credit facility bore interest at libor plus a margin of to  in accordance with a defined rate spread based upon the then current ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
on march   we entered into a loan and security agreement with another bank for a new  revolving credit facility to replace the prior facility 
in addition  we obtained a new  equipment line of credit available for financing or leasing large mobile equipment used in our operations from the same bank 
the new revolving credit facility is secured by our accounts receivable and inventories  provides for an interest rate of libor plus and originally matured on march  the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility was repaid in full on august  with proceeds from our private placement  discussed below  and the loan and security agreement was amended to allow the revolving credit facility to be increased to  at our option 
the weighted average interest rate for our revolving credit facilities for outstanding balances in was 
on december   the loan and security agreement was amended to increase the revolving credit facility to  and extend the maturity to april  as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the  revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had entered into approximately  of operating leases for mobile equipment under the  equipment line 
in april  we engaged frost securities  inc frost to advise us on possible financing alternatives for the phase ii expansion of our arkansas facilities 
frost contacted potential sources of financing and obtained several term sheet proposals for a subordinated debt placement from outside investors 
in conjunction with the review of the proposals and further negotiations  frost and management renewed discussions with our two largest shareholders and a third party to determine whether they would be interested in the investment on terms more favorable to the company than those then available from other potential outside investors 
on august   we sold  of sub notes in a private placement under section of the securities act of to three accredited investors  one of which is an affiliate of inberdon enterprises ltd  our majority shareholder inberdon  and another of which is an affiliate of robert s 
beall  who owns approximately of our outstanding shares 
we believe that the terms of the private placement are more favorable to us than the proposals previously received 
frost provided an opinion to the company s board of directors that  from a financial point of view  the private placement was fair to the unaffiliated holders of the company s common stock in relation to other potential subordinated debt transactions then available to us 
we paid frost an aggregate of  for its advice  placement services and opinion 
the net proceeds of approximately  from the private placement are being used to fund the phase ii expansion of our arkansas facilities 
terms of the sub notes include a maturity date of august   subject to acceleration upon a change in control  no mandatory principal payments prior to maturity  an interest rate of paid in cash and paid in cash or in kind at our option  and  except as discussed below  no optional prepayment prior to august  and a prepayment penalty if repaid before maturity 
the terms of the sub notes are identical to one another  except that the sub note for the affiliate of inberdon does not prohibit prepayment prior to august  and does not require a prepayment penalty if repaid before maturity  resulting in a weighted average prepayment penalty of approximately if the sub notes are repaid before maturity 
the sub notes include covenants similar to the covenants for the loan 
the private placement also included six year detachable warrants  providing the sub note investors the right to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock  at of the average closing price of one share of common stock for the trailing trading days prior to closing  or 
after august   or upon an earlier change in control  the investors may require the company to repurchase any or all shares acquired through exercise of the warrants the warrant shares 
the repurchase price for each warrant share will equal the average closing price of one share of the company s common stock for the trading days preceding the date the warrant shares are put back to the company 
changes in the repurchase price for each warrant share are accreted or decreted over the five year period from the date of issuance to august  the investors are also entitled to certain registration rights for the resale of their warrant shares 
as a result of certain negotiations with our existing bank lenders  the loan and the revolving credit facility were amended to approve the terms of the sub notes 
as part of these amendments  we are prohibited from paying any dividends in cash through june  without the prior written consent of the bank lenders 
during the fourth quarter  we required additional capital because the costs to complete both the arkansas phase i project and the new pulverized limestone production line at texas were significantly higher than 
table of contents originally anticipated and because our cash flows and operating profits were lower than expected 
to meet our short term liquidity demands  we determined to make a pro rata rights offering to our existing shareholders to raise  in additional equity capital 
we also obtained a  bridge loan from inberdon 
we commenced the rights offering on december   and it closed on february  in the rights offering  we raised  in additional equity capital  realizing net proceeds of  and issued  shares of common stock at the subscription price of per share 
we were able to honor in full all over subscription requests from our shareholders 
our majority shareholder  inberdon  subscribed for its full pro rata amount and also purchased  at the per share subscription price   additional shares not purchased by other shareholders in the rights offering  for a total investment of approximately  immediately following the rights offering  inberdon owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
the net proceeds of the rights offering were used to repay the  bridge loan from inberdon  to repay the  outstanding under our revolving credit facility at that time  and for working capital 
as of december   we had approximately  in total debt outstanding and  of cash and cash equivalents 
capital expenditures 
we completed the modernization and expansion project at our texas facility at the end of in addition  during the fourth quarter  we commissioned a new line for the production of pls at texas and  in  constructed an additional storage facility there 
the lack of reliability of a single pls production line had been a restraining factor on sales to several large customers requiring around the clock availability 
these investments have allowed us to better serve existing customers and to pursue new business opportunities  resulting in new pls customers during and the arkansas modernization and expansion project began in the fourth quarter and was expected to be completed in two phases 
phase i involved the redevelopment of the quarry plant  rebuilding of the railroad to standard gauge  the purchase of a facility to establish an out of state terminal in shreveport  louisiana  the installation of a rotary kiln with preheater and increased product storage and loading capacity 
we completed phase i in the second quarter the total cost of phase i of the arkansas project was approximately  the  included approximately  of costs associated with the pre building of certain facilities for phase ii of the project and the purchase of  but not all of the improvements to  the out of state terminal in shreveport  louisiana 
the phase ii expansion will double the arkansas plant s quicklime production capacity through the installation of a second preheater rotary kiln and additional storage capacity substantially identical to the kiln system built in phase i 
construction of the second kiln system commenced in the third quarter and is substantially complete as of the date of this report 
the plans for phase ii include the rehabilitation of the distribution terminal in shreveport  louisiana  currently expected to be completed in the estimated total cost to complete phase ii is approximately  we are financing the completion of the phase ii expansion principally through the net proceeds of the august  private placement discussed above 
we invested  in capital expenditures in  compared to  in in  approximately  of our capital expenditures related to the arkansas phase ii expansion project 
we expect to spend approximately  to  per year over the next several years for normal recurring capital and re equipping projects at the plant facilities to maintain or improve efficiency and reduce costs

future potential liability will vary with the market price of our common stock 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity 
at march   we had made no draws on our new  revolving credit facility 
we believe that cash on hand  funds generated from operations and amounts available under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating needs  ongoing capital needs and debt service for additionally  with our anticipated increase in cash flows from operations following the completion of our phase ii expansion project at arkansas  and funds available under our revolving credit facility  we believe that we will have sufficient capital resources to meet our liquidity needs for the near future and enable us to refinance our long term debt prior to maturities in and additional factors 
effects of leverage and restrictions imposed by terms of our indebtedness 
following the closing of our  loan in and issuance of the  in sub notes in  we are highly leveraged 
as of december   our total consolidated indebtedness and total stockholders equity were  and  respectively  and total indebtedness represented of total capitalization  compared to as of december  as a result of our total indebtedness  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness 
our ability to service our debt and to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in the loan and sub notes is subject to financial  economic  competitive and other factors 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in particular  our ability to service the indebtedness will depend upon our ability to sustain current levels of revenues and cash flows from operations as a result of the modernization and expansion of the texas and arkansas plants 
short term liquidity demands 
funds available under our  revolving credit facility and funds generated from operations should allow us to meet current liquidity demands 
however  should our cash flows from operations deteriorate  we may have to obtain additional financing  and there is no assurance we will be able to do so at favorable rates  given our current levels of indebtedness 
due to the seasonal nature of our sales and revenues  we may need to draw down from our revolving credit facility during the first half to provide funds for necessary repayments of principal and interest on our debt  completion of the phase ii expansion project  winter capital projects  normal recurring capital and re 
table of contents equipping projects and normal working capital needs 
if we draw on the revolver in the first half  we expect to repay any outstanding balance on the facility during the second half factors that could affect our success 
in the normal course of our business operations  we face risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and competitive position 
not all risks are foreseeable or within our ability to control 
these risks arise from factors including  but not limited to  fluctuating demand for lime and limestone products  our ability to produce and store quantities of lime and limestone products sufficient in amount and quality to meet customer demands  the success of our modernization and expansion strategies  including our ability to execute the strategies and complete projects on time and within budget  our access to capital  costs especially natural gas and other energy prices  inclement weather and the effects of seasonal trends 
environmental compliance 
we incur environmental compliance costs  including capital costs  maintenance and operating costs with respect to pollution control facilities  the cost of ongoing monitoring programs  the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs and liabilities relating to our compliance with environmental laws 
the rate of change of such laws has been rapid over the last decade  and compliance can require significant expenditures 
we believe that our expenditure requirements for future environmental compliance will continue to increase as operational and reporting standards are increased 
discovery of currently unknown conditions could require additional expenditures 
we intend to comply with all environmental laws 
because many of the requirements are subjective and therefore not quantifiable or presently determinable  or may be affected by future legislation and rulemaking  it is not possible to accurately predict the aggregate future costs of compliance and their effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or competitive position 
we currently have no material provisions for estimated costs or other liabilities in connection with expected environmental related expenditures 
our operating air permits for arkansas phase i and phase ii cover air emissions generated at the facilities and contain stringent criteria that the new rotary lime kilns and plant must meet 
until testing has been completed on the second kiln to demonstrate the ability to comply with the permit conditions  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required  or operating conditions imposed  in order to achieve compliance 
completion of phase ii of the arkansas project 
in the third quarter  we commenced construction of the second preheater rotary kiln and additional storage capacity at arkansas that is substantially identical to the kiln system built in phase i and is the major portion of the phase ii expansion project at our arkansas facilities 
the second kiln system  which is substantially completed  will double the arkansas plant s quicklime production capacity 
we also intend to complete the distribution terminal in shreveport  louisiana to provide for an additional outlet for the increased arkansas production 
to finance the phase ii expansion  we issued  of new sub debt 
notwithstanding current demand for lime and limestone products  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell our increased production at arkansas  or that any such sales will be profitable 
competition 
the lime industry is highly regionalized and competitive 
our competitors are predominately private companies 
the primary competitive factors in the lime industry are quality  price  ability to meet customer demand  proximity to customers  personal relationships and timeliness of deliveries  with varying emphasis on these factors depending upon the specific product application 
to the extent that one or more of our competitors becomes more successful with respect to any key competitive factor  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or competitive position could be materially adversely affected 
although demand and prices for lime and limestone have been improving in recent years  we are unable to predict future demand and prices  and cannot provide any assurance that current levels of demand and prices will continue or that any future increases in demand or price can be sustained 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
we are exposed to commodity price risk related to the price volatility of natural gas utilized at our plants 
from time to time  we enter into forward purchase contracts for the delivery of a portion of our natural gas requirements 
at december   we had committed to purchase  mmbtu per month for january  february and march at an average price of per mmbtu 
as of december   the average market price for deliveries for these months was approximately 
we recorded a mark to market adjustment resulting in a 
table of contents  reduction of labor and other operating expenses at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk 
our primary debt obligations are the loan  the sub notes and our revolving credit facility 
because the loan and the sub notes bear a fixed rate of interest  changes in interest rates do not subject us to changes in future interest expense with respect to these borrowings 
borrowings  if any  under our revolving credit facility  bear interest at a variable rate of libor plus 
as of march   we have no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
warrant shares repurchase obligation 
after august   or upon an earlier change of control  the sub note investors may require the company to repurchase any or all of the  shares that may be purchased by exercising the company s outstanding warrants 
the repurchase price for each share is equal to the average closing price of one share of the company s common stock for the trading days preceding the date the shares are put back to the company 
based on the per share average closing price for the trading days prior to december   the fair value of the warrant put liability is estimated to be the december  carrying value for this liability is the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the warrant put liability is being accreted  and changes in the repurchase price for each share are accreted or decreted  over the five year period from the date of issuance to august  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements
