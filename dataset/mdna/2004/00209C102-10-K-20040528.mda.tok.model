on june   the company received a waiver from the lender for non compliance of certain new facility covenants as of february  interest rates on both the revolving line and term loan facility were increased and can decrease if the company meets certain financial criteria 
in addition  certain financial ratio covenants were modified 
the additional interest is not payable until the current expiration date of the facility which is november as part of this modification  the lender and the dss and dsi noteholders amended the subordination agreement and the noteholders amended the notes issued to pay the purchase price

operating cash flows have been our primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund our working capital  capital expenditures  and internal business expansion and debt service 
the company s cash flow has been aided by the recent sale of unregistered equity securities  securities convertible into equity and by the debt restructuring completed on june  we believe that our capital resources are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve months 
we expect to meet our future working capital  capital expenditure  internal business expansion  and debt service from a combination of operating cash flows and funds available under the facility 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case

hospitals are experiencing flat to declining admission rates and are placing greater reliance on full time staff overtime and increased nurse patient loads 
because of difficult economic times  nurses in many households are becoming the primary breadwinner  causing them to seek more traditional full time employment 
the us department of health and human services said in a july report that the national supply of full time equivalent registered nurses was estimated at million and demand was estimated at million 
the percent gap between the supply of nurses and vacancies in is expected to grow to percent by and then to percent five years later 
as the economy rebounds  the prospects for the medical staffing industry should improve as hospitals experience higher admission rates and increasing shortages of healthcare workers 
critical accounting policies management s discussion in this item addresses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  workers compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company determines a need for a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company believes the following are its most critical accounting policies in that they are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of the company s service revenues are derived from a unique form of franchising under which independent companies or contractors licensees represent the company within a designated territory 
these licensees assign company personnel  including registered nurses and therapists  to service clients using the company s trade names and service marks 
the company pays and distributes the payroll for the direct service personnel who are all employees of the company  administers all payroll withholdings and payments  bills the customers and receives and processes the accounts receivable 
the revenues and related direct costs are included in the company s consolidated service revenues and operating costs 
the licensees are responsible for providing an office and paying related expenses for administration  including rent  utilities and costs for administrative personnel 
the company pays a monthly distribution or commission to its domestic licensees based on a defined formula of gross profit generated 
generally  the company pays a licensee approximately for certain licensees who have longer relationships with the company 
there is no payment to the licensees based solely on revenues 
for fiscal  and  total licensee distributions were approximately   and  respectively  and are included in the general and administrative expenses 
two of the company s largest licensees  direct staffing  inc and dss staffing corp  were owned by one unrelated third party and by a son and two sons in law of the president and chairman of the board of directors of the company 
such licensees were paid gross licensee fees approximately  in fiscal the company recognizes revenue as the related services are provided to customers and when the customer is obligated to pay for such completed services 
revenues are recorded net of contractual or other allowances to which customers are entitled 
employees assigned to particular customers may be changed at the customer s request or at the company s initiation 
a provision for uncollectible and doubtful accounts is provided for amounts billed to customers which may ultimately be uncollectible due to billing errors  documentation disputes or the customer s inability to pay 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers 
this evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
based upon the results of this analysis  the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts for this risk 
this analysis requires the company to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of companies acquired 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  sfas as of march  sfas provides specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should no longer be amortized  goodwill and intangibles must be reviewed for impairment annually or more often if certain events occur which could impact their carrying value  and the company s operations be formally identified into reporting units for the purpose of assessing impairments of goodwill 
other definite lived intangibles  primarily customer lists and non compete agreements  are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to years 
in accordance with sfas the company tested goodwill impairment at the end of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal as a result of the testing in the third quarter of fiscal  the company wrote off million of goodwill 
the company also performed its annual testing for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that no additional write offs were required to be taken 
if management s expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of the company s goodwill could change significantly 
such change could result in additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered 
the company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which utilization of the asset is not likely 
management s judgment is required in determining the realizability of the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded 
the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income 
any reduction in future forecasted operating and non operating taxable income may require that the company record an additional valuation against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period the valuation was recorded and could have a significant impact on the earnings of the company 
workers compensation reserves the company records its estimate of the ultimate cost of  and reserve for  workers compensation based on actuarial computations using the company s loss history as well as industry statistics 
furthermore  in determining its reserves  the company includes reserves for estimated claims incurred but not reported 
the ultimate cost of workers compensation will depend on actual costs incurred to settle the claims and may differ from the amounts reserved by the company for those claims 
accruals for workers compensation claims are included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
a significant increase in claims or changes in laws may require the company to record additional expenses related to workers compensation 
on the other hand  significantly improved claim experience may result in lower annual expense levels 
effect of inflation the impact of inflation on the company s sales and income from continuing operations was immaterial during fiscal in the past  the effects of inflation on salaries and operating expenses have been offset by the company s ability to increase its charges for services rendered 
the company anticipates that it will be able to continue to do so in the future 
the company continually reviews its costs in relation to the pricing of its services
