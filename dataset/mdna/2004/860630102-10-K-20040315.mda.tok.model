critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes

the following critical accounting policies and estimates are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
legal reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings resulting from lawsuits and arbitrations  which arise from its business activities 
some of these lawsuits and arbitrations claim substantial amounts  including punitive damage claims 
management has determined that it is likely that ultimate resolution in favor of the claimant will result in losses to the company on certain of these claims 
the company has  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses to the extent they believe certain claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
factors considered by management in estimating the company s liability are the loss and damages sought by the claimant plaintiff  the merits of the claim  the amount of loss in the client s account  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of the employee of the company  the total cost of defending the litigation  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for fines and penalties from regulatory agencies 
results of litigation and arbitration are inherently uncertain  and management s assessment of risk associated therewith is subject to change as the proceedings evolve 
after discussion with outside counsel  management  based on its understanding of the facts  reasonably estimates a range of loss and accrues what they consider appropriate to reserve against probable loss for certain claims  which is included in the consolidated statement of financial condition under the caption accounts payable and accrued expenses 
reserve for doubtful receivables from former employees the company offers transition pay  principally in the form of upfront loans  to investment executives and certain key revenue producers as part of the company s overall growth strategy 
these loans are generally forgiven over a five to ten year period if the individual satisfies certain conditions  usually based on continued employment and certain performance standards 
if the individual leaves before the term of the loan expires or fails to meet certain performance standards  the individual is required to repay the balance 
in determining the allowance for doubtful receivables from former employees  management considers the facts and circumstances surrounding each receivable  including the amount of the unforgiven balance  the reasons for the terminated employment relationship  and the former employees overall financial positions

investment securities of registered broker dealer subsidiaries are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
the fair value of investments  for which a quoted market or dealer price is not available  are based on management s estimates

the fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuation in the near term 
income tax matters the provision for state income taxes and related tax reserves is based on management s consideration of known liabilities and tax contingencies 
known liabilities are amounts that will appear on current tax returns  amounts that have been agreed to in revenue agent revisions as the result of examinations by the state taxing authorities  and amounts that will follow from such examinations but affect years other than those being examined 
tax contingencies are liabilities that might arise from a successful challenge by the state taxing authorities taking a contrary position or interpretation regarding the application of tax law to the company s tax return filings 
factors considered by management in estimating the company s liability are results of state tax audits  historical experience  and consultation with tax attorneys and other experts
