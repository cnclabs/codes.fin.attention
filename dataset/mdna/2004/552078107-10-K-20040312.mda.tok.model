the following table outlines the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment s primary products  annual processing capacities as of january   and the primary uses for such products 
unless otherwise specified  annual processing capacities were calculated by estimating the number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate  after allowing downtime for regular maintenance  and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix 
because the processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount  actual production volumes may be more or less than capacities set forth below 
capacities shown include of the capacity of joint venture facilities

table of contents raw materials the principal hydrocarbon raw materials purchased by the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment are propylene  butane  ethylene  benzene and methanol 
the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil and its principal refinery derivatives  natural gas liquids  and natural gas 
these materials are received in bulk quantities via pipeline or marine vessels 
generally  the segment s raw materials requirements are purchased at market based prices from numerous suppliers in the united states and europe with which the company has established contractual relationships  as well as in the spot market 
the company s raw material suppliers include equistar  which is a leading producer of propylene  ethylene and benzene and is expected to be the major supplier of these raw materials to lyondell s us business in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with methanex corporation methanex for methanex to become the exclusive supplier of the company s worldwide methanol raw material requirements 
the agreement provides supplies of methanol at cost based prices and is being phased in over time beginning in and extending through methanex has an option to extend the agreement for an additional three year period 
the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment is a large volume consumer of isobutane for chemical production 
the company has invested in facilities  or entered into processing agreements with unrelated parties  to convert the widely available commodity  normal butane  to isobutane 
the segment also is a large consumer of oxygen for its po tba plants at bayport  texas  botlek rotterdam  the netherlands  and fos sur mer  france 
the cost of raw materials generally is the largest component of total production cost for the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business 
the segment s raw materials are  in general  commodity chemicals with numerous bulk suppliers and ready availability at competitive prices 
historically  raw material availability has not been an issue for the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment 
however  in order to enhance reliability and competitiveness of prices and rates for supplies of raw materials  industrial gas and other utilities  the company is a party to long term agreements and other arrangements with suppliers  including equistar  for a substantial portion of its production requirements 
for additional discussion regarding the effects of raw material pricing on recent operating performance  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
marketing and sales in  most of the segment s revenues were derived from sales to  or processing agreements with  unrelated parties 
in  no single customer accounted for or more of lyondell s total revenues 
the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment produces and delivers products through sales agreements  processing agreements and spot sales as well as product exchanges 
production levels at lyondell s po sm and po tba co product production facilities are determined by the demand for po and po derivatives 
the resulting production levels of co products sm and mtbe thus depend primarily on the demand for po and po derivatives and secondarily on the relative market demand for sm and mtbe and the operational flexibility of lyondell s multiple production facilities in meeting this demand 
lyondell purchases sm and mtbe for resale  when necessary  to satisfy customer demand for these co products above co product production levels 
lyondell also purchased sm for resale to satisfy its contract customer requirements prior to commissioning its new po sm plant in the netherlands in the fourth quarter of volumes of sm and mtbe purchases made for resale can vary significantly from period to period 
however  purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profitability 
conversely  when co product production levels exceed contract customer demand  lyondell sells such sm or mtbe in the spot market

equistar petrochemicals segment overview petrochemicals are fundamental to many segments of the economy  including the production of consumer products  housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods 
equistar produces a variety of petrochemicals  including olefins  oxygenated products  aromatics and specialty products  at eleven facilities located in five states 
olefins include ethylene  propylene and butadiene 
oxygenated products include eo and derivatives  eg  ethanol and mtbe 
aromatics produced include benzene and toluene 
equistar s petrochemical products are used to manufacture polymers and intermediate chemicals  which are used in a variety of consumer and industrial products 
ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for polyethylene and a large number of other chemicals  plastics and synthetics 
the chocolate bayou  corpus christi and two channelview  texas olefins plants use crude oil based liquid raw materials  including naphtha  condensates and gas oils  to produce ethylene 
the use of crude oil based liquid raw materials results in the production of a significant amount of co products such as propylene  butadiene  benzene and toluene  and specialty products  such as dicyclopentadiene dcpd  isoprene  resin oil and piperylenes 
based upon independent surveys  management believes that its channelview facility is one of the lowest cash production cost olefins facilities in the united states 
equistar s morris  illinois  clinton  iowa  lake charles  louisiana  and laporte deer park  texas plants are designed to consume primarily natural gas liquids  including ethane  propane and butane collectively ngls  to produce ethylene with some co products such as propylene 
the corpus christi and channelview plants also may consume ngl s to produce ethylene  depending upon the relative economic advantage of the alternative raw materials 
a comprehensive pipeline system connects the gulf coast plants with major olefins customers 
raw materials are sourced both internationally and domestically and are shipped via vessel and pipeline 
equistar s lake charles  louisiana facility has been idled since the first quarter of  pending sustained improvement in market conditions 
olefins accounted for approximately of equistar s total revenues in  in and in equistar produces eo and its primary derivative  eg  at its bayport facilities located in pasadena  texas and through a joint venture with dupont in beaumont  texas 
the bayport facility also produces other derivatives of eo  principally ethylene glycol ethers and ethanolamines 
eg is used in antifreeze  polyester fibers  resins and films 
eo and its derivatives are used in many consumer and industrial end uses  such as detergents and surfactants  brake fluids and polyurethane seating and bedding foams 
equistar produces synthetic ethanol at its tuscola  illinois plant by a direct hydration process that combines water and ethylene 
equistar also owns and operates a facility in newark  new jersey for denaturing ethanol by the addition of certain chemicals 
in addition  equistar produces small volumes of diethyl ether  a by product of its ethanol production  at its tuscola facility 
these ethanol products are ingredients in various consumer and industrial products  as described more fully in the table below 

table of contents the following table outlines equistar s primary petrochemical products  annual processing capacity as of january   and the primary uses for such products 
unless otherwise specified  annual processing capacity was calculated by estimating the number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate  after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance  and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix 
because the processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount  actual production volumes may be more or less than the capacities set forth below

raw materials the raw materials cost for olefins production is the largest component of total cost for the petrochemicals business 
the primary raw materials used in the production of olefins are crude oil based liquids also referred to as heavy raw materials and ngls also referred to as light raw materials 
crude oil based liquids generally are delivered by ship or barge 
ngls are delivered to equistar s facilities primarily via pipeline 
olefins plants with the flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials historically have had lower variable costs than olefins plants that are restricted in their raw material processing capability to ngls 
crude oil based liquids have had an historical cost advantage over ngls such as ethane and propane  assuming the co products were recovered and sold 
facilities using crude oil based liquids historically have generated  on average  approximately four cents of additional variable margin per pound of ethylene produced compared to facilities restricted to using ethane 
this margin advantage is based on an average of historical data over a period of years and is subject to short term fluctuations  which can be significant 
for example  during the first quarter of  when crude oil prices rose sharply in anticipation of the war in iraq  the advantage was significantly reduced 
however  the advantage rebounded strongly in the second quarter of  bringing the yearly average back to historical levels 
equistar has the capability to realize this margin advantage due to its ability to process crude oil based liquids at the channelview  corpus christi and chocolate bayou facilities 
equistar temporarily idled its laporte ethylene facility from june to august to lower its average cost of us ethylene production by taking advantage of unused production capacity at its channelview  corpus christi and chocolate bayou facilities  which can process crude oil based liquids 
the channelview facility is particularly flexible because it can range from processing all crude oil based liquids to processing a majority of ngls 
the corpus christi plant can range from processing predominantly crude oil based liquids to processing predominantly ngls 
the chocolate bayou facility processes crude oil based liquids 
equistar s laporte facility can process natural gasoline and ngls  including heavier ngls such as butane 
equistar s three other olefins facilities process only ngls 
as described above  equistar believes that its raw material flexibility is a key advantage in the production of olefins 
as a result  although the majority of equistar s crude oil based liquids requirements are purchased via contractual arrangements from a variety of domestic and international sources  equistar also purchases crude oil based liquids on the spot market from domestic and international sources in order to maintain its raw material flexibility and to take advantage of raw material pricing opportunities 
similarly  equistar purchases a majority of its ngls requirements via contractual arrangements from a variety of sources  but also purchases ngls on the spot market 
equistar also obtains a portion of its crude oil based liquids requirements from lcr at market related prices 
equistar purchases all of its methanol requirements from lyondell at cost based prices 
also  equistar purchases large amounts of natural gas to be used as energy for consumption in its business via market based contractual arrangements with a variety of sources 
the raw materials for equistar s petrochemicals segment are  in general  commodity crude oil based liquids and ngls with numerous bulk suppliers and ready availability at competitive prices 
historically  raw material availability has not been an issue for equistar s petrochemicals business segment 
for additional discussion regarding the effects of raw material pricing on recent operating performance  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents marketing and sales ethylene produced by the clinton and morris facilities generally is consumed as a raw material by the polymers operations at those sites  or is transferred to tuscola from morris by pipeline for the production of ethanol 
ethylene produced by equistar s laporte facility is consumed as a raw material by equistar s polymers operations and millennium s vinyl acetate operations in laporte and also is distributed by pipeline for other internal uses and to third parties 
ethylene and propylene produced at the channelview  chocolate bayou  corpus christi and lake charles olefins plants generally are distributed by pipeline or via exchange agreements to equistar s gulf coast polymer and eo eg facilities as well as to equistar s affiliates and unrelated parties 
equistar s lake charles facility has been idled since the first quarter of  pending sustained improvement in market conditions 
for the year ended december   approximately of equistar s ethylene  based on sales dollars  was sold to equistar s polymers or oxygenated products businesses or sold to equistar s owners and their affiliates at market related prices 
in addition  equistar also had significant ethylene sales to occidental chemical corporation a subsidiary of occidental  which is the beneficial owner of approximately of lyondell during pursuant to a long term ethylene supply agreement 
equistar sells a majority of its olefins products to customers with whom it has had long standing relationships 
these sales generally are made under written agreements that typically provide for monthly negotiation of price  customer purchases of a specified minimum quantity  and three to six year terms with automatic one or two year term extension provisions 
some contracts may be terminated early if deliveries have been suspended for several months 
no single petrochemicals customer accounted for or more of equistar s total revenues in eo and eg typically are sold under three to five year contracts  with monthly pricing based on market conditions 
lyondell provides sales services for equistar outside of north america for eo derivatives 
glycol ethers are sold primarily into the solvent and distributor markets at market prices  as are ethanolamines and brake fluids 
ethanol and ethers primarily are sold under one year contracts at market prices 
equistar licenses mtbe technology under a license from a subsidiary of lyondell and sells a significant portion of mtbe produced at one of its two channelview units to lyondell at market related prices 
the production from the second unit is processed by equistar and returned to lcr for gasoline blending 
mtbe produced at chocolate bayou is sold at market related prices to lyondell for resale 
equistar sells most of its aromatics production under contracts that have initial terms ranging from one to three years and that typically contain automatic one year term extension provisions 
these contracts provide for monthly price adjustments based upon market prices 
benzene produced by lcr is sold directly to equistar at market related prices 
equistar serves as lcr s sole agent to market toluene produced by lcr and receives a marketing fee for such services 
equistar at times purchases ethylene  propylene  benzene and butadiene for resale  when necessary  to satisfy customer demand for these products above production levels 
volumes of ethylene  propylene  benzene and butadiene purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period 
however  purchased volumes do not have a significant impact on profitability 
most of the ethylene and propylene production of the channelview  chocolate bayou  corpus christi  la porte and lake charles facilities is shipped via a  mile pipeline system which has connections to numerous gulf coast ethylene and propylene consumers 
this pipeline system  some of which is owned and some of which is leased by equistar  extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu to port arthur  texas as well as around the lake charles  louisiana area 
in addition  exchange agreements with other olefins producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to equistar s pipeline system 
some ethylene is shipped by railcar from clinton  iowa to morris  illinois 
a pipeline owned and operated by an unrelated party is used to transport ethylene from morris  illinois to tuscola  illinois 
some propylene is shipped by ocean going vessel 
ethylene oxide is shipped by railcar  and its derivatives are shipped by railcar  truck  isotank or ocean going vessel 
butadiene  aromatics and other petrochemicals are distributed by pipeline  railcar  truck  barge or ocean going vessel 

table of contents in  equistar entered into a long term propylene supply arrangement with a subsidiary of sunoco  inc beginning in april  equistar supplies million pounds of propylene annually to sunoco  with a majority of the propylene to be supplied under a cost based formula and the balance to be supplied on a market related basis 
this year supply arrangement replaces a previous contract under which equistar supplied million pounds of propylene annually to sunoco at market related prices

competition and industry conditions the bases for competition in equistar s petrochemicals products are price  product quality  product deliverability  reliability of supply and customer service 
equistar competes with other large domestic producers of petrochemicals  including bp  chevron phillips chemical company lp chevronphillips  dow  enterprise products partners lp  exxon mobil corporation exxonmobil  huntsman chemical company huntsman and shell 
industry consolidation  including the combinations of british petroleum and amoco  exxon and mobil  and dow and union carbide and the formation of chevronphillips  has brought north american production capacity under the control of fewer  although larger and stronger  competitors 
equistar s combined rated ethylene capacity at january  was approximately billion pounds per year  or approximately of total north american production capacity 
based on published rated production capacities  equistar believes it is the second largest producer of ethylene in north america 
north american ethylene rated capacity at january  was approximately billion pounds per year 
approximately of the total ethylene production capacity in north america is located along the gulf coast 
petrochemicals profitability is affected by raw materials costs and the level of demand for petrochemicals and their derivatives  along with vigorous price competition among producers which may intensify due to  among other things  the addition of new capacity 
ethylene markets continue to be affected by excess capacity as a result of previous capacity additions  which have not yet been fully absorbed due to weak demand growth over the last three years 
however  with the shut down of two of dow s gulf coast olefins plants in and improving demand as worldwide economic growth recovers  operating rates have begun to improve 
in general  demand is a function of economic growth in the united states and elsewhere in the world  which fluctuates 
it is not possible to accurately predict the changes in raw material costs  market conditions and other factors that will affect petrochemical industry profitability in the future 
the petrochemicals industry historically has experienced significant volatility in profitability due to fluctuations in capacity utilization 
equistar s other major commodity chemical products also experience cyclical market conditions similar to  although not necessarily coincident with  those of olefins

table of contents lyondell citgo refining lp refining segment overview lyondell participates in petroleum refining through an equity interest in lcr 
lyondell holds a interest in lcr and citgo holds a interest in lcr 
lcr owns and operates a refinery the refinery  which is located on the houston ship channel in houston  texas 
lcr was formed in to upgrade the refinery s ability to process substantial additional volumes of lower cost  extra heavy  higher sulfur crude oil 
as of january   the refinery s extra heavy crude oil processing capacity was approximately  barrels per day 
the refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to run extra heavy degree api  high sulfur crude oil 
the degree api gravity crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals  making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other high value fuel products  but less costly to purchase 
processing extra heavy  high sulfur crude oil in significant quantities requires a refinery with extensive coking  catalytic cracking  hydrotreating and desulfurization capabilities  ie  a complex refinery 
the refinery s complexity enables it to operate in full conversion mode  producing a slate of products that consists primarily of high value  clean products due to a lack of conversion equipment  many refineries produce significant quantities of lower value products such as conventional gasoline  high sulfur diesel and heavy fuel oil 
the refinery s clean products include premium grades such as reformulated gasoline  jet fuel  low sulfur diesel and aromatics 
the refinery s products also include conventional gasoline  lubricants industrial lubricants  white oils and process oils  carbon black oil  refinery grade propylene  sulfur  residual fuel and petroleum coke 
gasoline accounted for approximately of lcr s total revenues in and and in diesel accounted for approximately of lcr s total revenues in and and in the aromatics produced by the refinery are benzene  toluene  orthoxylene and paraxylene 
these products are sold to manufacturers of intermediate chemicals and polyester intermediates and are ultimately used in clothing  soft drink bottles and drinking cups  audio and video tapes  and resins 
the following table outlines lcr s primary products  annual rated capacity as of january   and the primary uses for such products 
the term rated capacity  as used in this table  is calculated by estimating the number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate  after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance  and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix 
because the rated capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount  the actual production volumes may be more or less than the rated capacity 
capacities shown represent of the capacity of lcr  of which lyondell owns

b produced by lcr and sold to equistar 
c produced by lcr and marketed for lcr by equistar 
d produced by lcr and marketed for lcr by citgo 

table of contents management of lcr lcr is a limited partnership organized under the laws of the state of delaware 
lyondell owns its interest in lcr through wholly owned subsidiaries  which serve as general partner and limited partner 
similarly  citgo  which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of petr leos de venezuela  sa pdvsa  the national oil company of the republic of venezuela  owns its interest in lcr through wholly owned subsidiaries  which serve as general partner and limited partner 
lcr is governed by a limited partnership agreement the lcr partnership agreement  which provides for  among other things  the ownership and cash distribution rights of the partners 
the lcr partnership agreement also provides that lcr is managed by a partnership governance committee  which is composed of six representatives  three appointed by each general partner 
actions requiring unanimous consent of the representatives include amendment of the lcr partnership agreement  borrowing money  delegations of authority to committees  certain purchase commitments and capital expenditures 
the day to day operations of the refinery are managed by a general manager  who is a loaned employee of lyondell 
agreements between lyondell or citgo and lcr lcr is a party to a number of agreements with lyondell and citgo 
under the terms of a long term product sales agreement products agreement  citgo purchases from lcr substantially all of the refined products produced at the refinery 
lyondell and citgo perform administrative services for lcr pursuant to an administrative services agreement  which is renegotiated annually 
under the terms of lubricant sales agreements  citgo purchases all of the lubricant products manufactured by lcr 
during  lcr permanently shut down its lubricants facility located in birmingport  alabama  which previously had been operated by citgo 
in addition  citgo serves as lcr s sole agent to market paraxylene and orthoxylene produced by lcr 
agreements between equistar and lcr prior to the formation of equistar  lyondell was a party with lcr to multiple agreements designed to preserve many of the synergies between the refinery and the channelview petrochemicals facility 
most of these agreements were assumed by equistar from lyondell effective december  economic evaluations at the channelview facility and the refinery are made to maximize product utilization  which may be local use  use at the other site  or third party sales 
certain refinery products propane  butane  low octane naphthas  heating oils and gas oils can be used as raw materials for olefins production  and certain channelview facility olefins by products can be processed by the refinery into gasoline 
butylenes from the refinery are processed by the channelview facility and returned to lcr as alkylate and mtbe  which primarily are used as components for gasoline blending 
hydrogen from the channelview facility is used at the refinery for sulfur removal and product quality improvement 
benzene produced by lcr is sold directly to equistar at market related prices 
in addition  equistar serves as lcr s sole agent to market toluene produced by lcr 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
raw materials in  lcr entered into a long term crude supply agreement crude supply agreement with lagoven  sa  now known as pdvsa petr leo  sa pdvsa oil  an affiliate of citgo and of pdvsa 
most of the crude oil used by lcr as a raw material for the refinery is purchased under the crude supply agreement 
both pdvsa oil and citgo are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of pdvsa 
the crude supply agreement  which expires on december   incorporates formula prices to be paid by lcr for the crude oil supplied based on the market value of a slate of refined products deemed to be produced from each particular crude oil or raw material  less certain deemed refining costs  adjustable for inflation and energy costs  certain actual costs  and a deemed margin  which varies according to the grade of crude oil or other raw material delivered 
the actual refining margin earned by lcr may vary from the formula amount depending on  among other things  timing differences in incorporating changes in refined product market values and energy costs into the crude supply agreement s deemed margin calculations and the efficiency with which lcr conducts its operations 
although lcr believes that the crude supply agreement reduces the volatility of lcr s earnings 
table of contents and cash flows over the long term  the crude supply agreement also limits lcr s ability to enjoy higher margins during periods when the market price of crude oil is low relative to then current market prices for refined products 
in addition  if the actual yields  costs or volumes of the lcr refinery differ substantially from those contemplated by the crude supply agreement  the benefits of this agreement to lcr could be substantially diminished  and could result in lower earnings and cash flow for lcr 
furthermore  there may be periods during which lcr s costs for crude oil under the crude supply agreement may be higher than might otherwise be available to lcr from other sources 
a disparate increase in the market price of heavy crude oil relative to the prices of heavy crude oil under the crude supply agreement has the tendency to make continued performance of its obligations under the crude supply agreement less attractive to pdvsa oil 
the crude supply agreement provides that lyondell controls all of lcr s decisions and enforcement rights in connection with the crude supply agreement so long as pdvsa has a direct or indirect ownership interest in lcr 
however  there are risks associated with reliance on pdvsa oil for supplies of crude oil and with enforcing the provisions of contracts with companies such as pdvsa oil that are non united states affiliates of a sovereign nation 
all of the crude oil supplied by pdvsa oil under the crude supply agreement is produced in the republic of venezuela  which has experienced economic difficulties and attendant social and political changes and unrest in recent years  including a national strike during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of that disrupted crude oil deliveries to lcr 
the republic of venezuela may continue to experience these difficulties and changes 
it is impossible to predict how governmental policies may change under the current or any subsequent venezuelan government 
in addition  there are risks associated with enforcing judgments of united states courts against entities whose assets are located outside of the united states and whose management does not reside in the united states 
although the parties have negotiated certain alternative arrangements in the event of specified force majeure conditions  including venezuelan governmental or other actions restricting or otherwise limiting pdvsa oil s ability to perform its obligations  any such alternative arrangements may not be as beneficial to lcr as the crude supply agreement 
from time to time  the company and pdvsa have had discussions covering both a restructuring of the crude supply agreement and a broader restructuring of the lcr partnership 
the company is unable to predict whether changes in either arrangement will occur 
if the crude supply agreement is modified or terminated or this source of crude oil is otherwise interrupted  due to production difficulties  political or economic events in venezuela or other factors  lcr could experience significantly lower earnings and cash flows 
subject to the consent of the other partner and rights of first offer and first refusal  the partners each have a right to transfer their interests in lcr to unaffiliated third parties in certain circumstances 
if neither citgo  pdvsa oil or their affiliates were a partner in lcr  pdvsa oil would have an option to terminate the crude supply agreement 
if pdvsa oil were to terminate the crude supply agreement  citgo would have the option to terminate the products agreement 
depending on then current market conditions  any breach or termination of the crude supply agreement  or reduction in supply thereunder  would require lcr to purchase all or a portion of its crude oil in the merchant market  could subject lcr to significant volatility and price fluctuations and could adversely affect lcr and  therefore  lyondell 
there can be no assurance that alternative crude oil supplies with similar margins would be available for purchase by lcr 
under the crude supply agreement  pdvsa oil is required to sell  and lcr is required to purchase   barrels per day of extra heavy crude oil  which constitutes approximately of the refinery s refining capacity of  barrels per day of crude oil 
since april  pdvsa oil has  from time to time  declared itself in a force majeure situation and subsequently reduced deliveries of crude oil 
such reductions in deliveries were purportedly based on announced opec production cuts 
at such times  pdvsa oil informed lcr that the venezuelan government  through the ministry of energy and mines  had instructed that production of certain grades of crude oil be reduced 
in certain circumstances  pdvsa oil made payments to lcr under a different provision of the crude supply agreement in partial compensation for such reductions 

table of contents in january  pdvsa oil again declared itself in a force majeure situation and  beginning in march  reduced deliveries of crude oil to lcr 
although deliveries increased to contract levels of  barrels per day during the third quarter  pdvsa oil did not revoke its january force majeure declaration during a national strike in venezuela began in early december and disrupted deliveries of crude oil to lcr under the crude supply agreement 
pdvsa oil again declared a force majeure and reduced deliveries of crude oil to lcr 
in march  pdvsa oil notified lcr that the force majeure had been lifted with respect to crude oil under the crude supply agreement 
for additional discussion regarding the effects of the political unrest in venezuela on operating performance  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
lcr has consistently contested the validity of pdvsa oil s and pdvsa s reductions in deliveries under the crude supply agreement 
the parties have different interpretations of the provisions of the contracts concerning the delivery of crude oil 
the contracts do not contain dispute resolution procedures  and the parties have been unable to resolve their commercial dispute 
as a result  on february   lcr filed a lawsuit against pdvsa and pdvsa oil in connection with the force majeure declarations  which lcr is continuing to litigate 
see item legal proceedings litigation matters 
marketing and sales the refinery produces gasoline  low sulfur diesel  jet fuel  aromatics  lubricants and certain industrial products 
on a weekly basis  lcr evaluates and determines the optimal product output mix for the refinery  based on spot market prices and conditions 
under the products agreement  citgo is obligated to purchase and lcr is required to sell of the finished gasoline  jet fuel  heating oil  diesel fuel  coke and sulfur produced by the refinery 
citgo purchases these products at market related prices based on regional industry benchmark indexes 
for example  the price for gasoline is based on prices published by platts oilgram  an industry trade publication 
the products agreement provides that lyondell controls all of lcr s material decisions and enforcement rights in connection with the products agreement so long as citgo has a direct or indirect ownership interest in lcr 
the products agreement expires on december  competition and industry conditions the refining business tends to be volatile as well as cyclical 
crude oil prices  which are impacted by worldwide political events and the economics of exploration and production in addition to refined products demand  are the largest source of the volatility 
demand for refined products is influenced by seasonal and short term factors such as weather and driving patterns  as well as by longer term issues such as the economy  energy conservation and alternative fuels 
industry refined products supply is also dependent on industry operating capabilities and on long term refining capacity trends 
management believes that the combination of the crude supply agreement and the products agreement generally has the effect of stabilizing earnings and cash flows and reducing the market driven aspects of the business volatility over the long term 
with a capacity of approximately  barrels per day  the company believes that the refinery is one of north america s largest full conversion ie  not producing asphalt or high sulfur heavy fuel refinery capable of processing api crude oil 
among lcr s refining competitors are major integrated oil companies and domestic refiners that are owned by or affiliated with major integrated oil companies 
based on published industry data  as of january   there were crude oil refineries in operation in the united states  and total domestic refinery capacity was approximately million barrels per day 
during  lcr processed an average of  barrels per day of crude oil or approximately of all us crude runs 

table of contents properties lcr owns the real property  plant and equipment  which make up the refinery  located on approximately acres in houston  texas 
units include a fluid catalytic cracking unit  cokers  reformers  crude distillation units  sulfur recovery plants  and hydrodesulfurization units  as well as a lube oil manufacturing plant and an aromatics recovery unit 
lcr owns a pipeline used to transport gasoline  kerosene and heating oil from the refinery to the gatx terminal located in pasadena  texas to interconnect with common carrier pipelines 
lcr s refinery and pipeline are mortgaged as collateral for lcr s bank term loan and revolving credit facilities 
during  lcr permanently shut down its birmingport  alabama lube oil blending and packaging facility 
employee relations at december   lcr employed approximately full time employees 
lcr also uses the services of independent contractors in the routine conduct of its business 
approximately of lcr s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement between lcr and the paper  allied industrial  chemical and energy workers international union  which expires in january although lcr is experiencing increased union activity  lcr believes that overall relations with its employees are good 
risk factors that may affect lyondell and its joint ventures there are many factors that may affect the businesses and results of operations of lyondell and its joint ventures 
some of these factors are discussed below 
for additional discussion regarding factors that may affect the businesses and operating results of lyondell and its joint ventures  see items and business and properties  forward looking statements  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item a 
disclosure of market and regulatory risk 
industry cyclicality and overcapacity the historical operating results of lyondell and its joint ventures reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply demand balance in both the chemical and refining industries 
these industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages leading to tight supply  causing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods when substantial capacity is added  resulting in oversupply  declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 
the cyclicality of these industries results in volatile profits and cash flow over the business cycle 
there is ongoing overcapacity in the chemical industry  as a number of participants in the chemical industry  including lyondell  have added capacity and demand growth has lagged behind rates experienced historically 
there can be no assurance that future growth in product demand will be sufficient to utilize current or additional capacity 
excess industry capacity has depressed and may continue to depress lyondell s and its joint ventures volumes and margins 
the global economic and political environment continues to be uncertain 
this environment and uncertainty contributed to low industry operating rates  added to the volatility of raw material and energy costs  and forestalled the industry s recovery from trough conditions  which has and may continue to place pressure on lyondell s and its joint ventures results of operations 
as a result of excess industry capacity and weak demand for products  as well as rising energy costs and raw material prices  lyondell s operating income has declined and may remain volatile 
raw materials and energy costs lyondell and its joint ventures purchase large amounts of raw materials and energy for their businesses 
the cost of these raw materials and energy  in the aggregate  represents a substantial portion of lyondell s and its joint ventures operating expenses 
the prices of raw materials and energy generally follow price trends of  and vary with the market conditions for  crude oil and natural gas  which may be highly volatile and cyclical 
results of operations for lyondell and its joint ventures have been and could be in the future significantly affected by increases and volatility in these costs 
price increases increase working capital needs for lyondell and its joint ventures  and can therefore also adversely affect liquidity and cash flow for lyondell and its joint ventures 

table of contents in addition  higher north american natural gas prices relative to natural gas cost advantaged regions  such as the middle east  have adversely affected the ability of many domestic chemical producers to compete internationally since natural gas prices affect a significant portion of the industry s raw materials and energy sources 
this environment has had a negative impact on equistar s exports  and has reduced the competitiveness of us producers 
it also has increased the competition for sales of chemicals in north america  as us production that would otherwise have been sold overseas was instead offered for sale domestically  resulting in excess supply and lower margins in north america 
general economic conditions and other external factors external factors beyond lyondell s and its joint ventures control  such as general economic conditions  international events and circumstances  competitor actions  and governmental regulation in the united states and abroad  can cause volatility in the price of raw materials and other operating costs  as well as significant fluctuations in demand for lyondell s and its joint ventures products  and can magnify the impact of economic cycles on lyondell s and its joint ventures businesses 
lyondell believes that events in the middle east had a particular influence in and may continue to do so 
in addition  a number of lyondell s and its joint ventures products are highly dependent on durable goods markets  such as the housing and automotive markets  that are themselves particularly cyclical 
many of lyondell s and its joint ventures products are components of other chemical products that  in turn  are subject to the supply demand balance of both the chemical and refining industries and general economic conditions 
if the global economy does not improve  demand for lyondell s and its joint ventures products and their income and cash flows would continue to be adversely affected 
in addition  these risks have and may continue to increase volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could result in increased raw material costs 
further  these risks could cause increased instability in the financial markets and adversely affect lyondell s and its joint ventures ability to access capital 
with respect to lyondell s refining joint venture  management believes that the combination of the crude supply agreement and the products agreement generally tends to stabilize earnings and to reduce market driven volatility over the long term 
however  there are risks associated with these agreements 
see international operations and country risks below 
lyondell and its joint ventures may reduce production at or idle a facility for an extended period of time or exit a business because of high raw material prices  an oversupply of a particular product and or a lack of demand for that particular product  which makes production uneconomical 
any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business would result in writing off the remaining book value of the assets involved 
temporary outages sometimes last for several quarters or  in certain cases  longer and cause lyondell or its joint ventures to incur costs  including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities 
it is possible that factors like increases in raw material costs or lower demand in the future will cause lyondell or its joint ventures to further reduce operating rates  idle facilities or exit uncompetitive businesses 
international operations and country risks international operations and exports are subject to a number of risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  political risks and risks of increases in duties and taxes  as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of companies in other countries 
as discussed earlier  lcr is party to a long term crude supply agreement with pdvsa oil  a wholly owned subsidiary of pdvsa 
there are risks associated with enforcing the provisions of contracts with companies such as pdvsa oil that are non us affiliates of a sovereign nation 
additionally  all of the crude oil supplied by pdvsa oil under the crude supply agreement is produced in the republic of venezuela  which has experienced economic difficulties and attendant social and political changes and unrest in recent years  including a national strike which disrupted crude oil deliveries to lcr 
see lyondell citgo refining lp raw materials  item legal proceedings litigation matters and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents commodity products lyondell and equistar sell their products in highly competitive markets 
due to the commodity nature of certain of the products of lyondell and equistar  competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance  product quality  product deliverability  reliability of supply and customer service 
as a result  lyondell and equistar generally are not able to protect their market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to their customers 
accordingly  increases in raw material and other costs may not necessarily correlate with changes in prices for these products  either in the direction of the price change or in magnitude 
in addition  lyondell s and equistar s ability to increase product sales prices  and the timing of those increases  are affected by the supply demand balances for their products  as well as the capacity utilization rates for those products 
timing differences in pricing between rising raw material costs  which may change daily  and contract product prices  which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often  sometimes with an additional lag in effective dates for increases  have had and may continue to have a negative effect on profitability 
environmental and other regulatory matters the company cannot predict with certainty the extent of its or its joint ventures future liabilities and costs under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations and the company cannot guarantee that they will not be material 
in addition  the company and its joint ventures may face liability for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals and other hazardous substances at their facilities or chemicals that they otherwise manufacture  handle or own 
although these types of claims have not historically had a material impact on the company s or its joint ventures operations  a significant increase in the success of these types of claims could materially adversely affect the company s or its joint ventures business  financial condition  operating results or cash flow 
the policy of each of lyondell  equistar and lcr is to be in compliance with all applicable environmental laws 
lyondell and equistar also are each committed to the principles of responsible care  an international chemical industry initiative to enhance the industry s responsible management of chemicals 
the company and its joint ventures together with the industries in which they operate are subject to extensive national  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  and are required to have permits and licenses regulating  emissions to the air  discharges onto land or waters and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
in addition  some of these laws and regulations require lyondell and its joint ventures to meet specific financial responsibility requirements 
the company cannot accurately predict future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws  and inspection and enforcement policies  as well as higher compliance costs  which might affect the handling  manufacture  use  emission or disposal of products  other materials or hazardous and non hazardous waste 
some risk of environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in particular operations and products of the company and its joint ventures  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses  and there is no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
in general  however  with respect to the costs and risks described above  the company does not expect that it or its joint ventures will be affected differently than the rest of the chemicals and refining industry where the company s or its joint ventures facilities are located 
environmental laws may have a significant effect on the nature and scope of cleanup of contamination at current and former operating facilities  the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and the costs of the storage and disposal of wastewater 
also  us superfund statutes may impose joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and actions on the entities that generated waste  arranged for disposal of the wastes  transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites 
all such responsible parties or any one of them  including the company may be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault  legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site 
in addition  similar environmental laws and regulations that have been or may be enacted in countries outside of the us may impose similar liabilities and costs upon the company 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters 

table of contents the company and its joint ventures have on site solid waste management units at several of their facilities  which were used in the past to dispose of waste generated at the facilities 
it is anticipated that corrective measures will be necessary to comply with federal and state requirements with respect to these facilities 
the company also has liabilities under the resource conservation and recovery act and various state and non us government regulations related to several current and former plant sites 
the company also is responsible for a portion of the remediation of certain off site waste disposal facilities 
the company is contributing funds to the cleanup of several waste sites throughout the us under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of the company also has been named as a potentially responsible party at several other sites 
the company s policy is to accrue remediation expenses when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related expenses can be reasonably estimated 
estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are necessarily imprecise due to such factors as the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of presently unknown remediation sites and the allocation of costs among the potentially responsible parties under applicable statutes 
the company and its joint ventures  to the extent appropriate  have accrued amounts without regard to potential insurance recoveries or other third party reimbursements believed to be sufficient to cover current estimates of the cost for remedial measures at manufacturing facilities and off site waste disposal facilities based upon their interpretation of current environmental standards 
in the opinion of management  there is currently no material range of loss in excess of the amount recorded 
based on the establishment of such accruals  and the status of discussions with regulatory agencies described in this paragraph  the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect upon its financial statements or competitive position as a result of compliance with the laws and regulations described in this or the preceding paragraphs 
see also item legal proceedings and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters 
in some cases  compliance with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations can only be achieved by capital expenditures 
in the years ended december   and  the company and its joint ventures on a basis spent  in the aggregate  approximately million  million and million  respectively  for environmentally related capital expenditures at existing facilities 
the increased and capital expenditures resulted from new emission reduction rules  as discussed below 
the company currently estimates that environmentally related capital expenditures at company facilities and existing joint venture facilities on a basis will be approximately million for and million for  including preliminary estimated expenditures for engineering studies related to emission control standards for highly reactive  volatile organic compounds hrvocs  as discussed below 
the eight county houston galveston region has been designated a severe non attainment area under the one hour ozone standard by the epa 
as a result  in december  the texas commission on environmental quality tceq submitted a plan to the epa to reach and demonstrate compliance with the ozone standard by november ozone is a product of the reaction between volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides nox in the presence of sunlight  and is a principal component of smog 
emission reduction controls for nox must be installed at the refinery and each of lyondell s two facilities and equistar s six facilities in the houston galveston region during the next several years 
revised rules adopted by the tceq in december changed the required nox emission reduction levels from to while requiring new controls on emissions of hrvocs  such as ethylene  propylene  butadiene and butylenes 
the tceq plans to make a final review of these rules  with final rule revisions to be adopted by october these rules also still require approval by the epa 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters for a summary of the estimated capital expenditures required for lyondell and its joint ventures to comply with the nox emission reduction requirements 
the timing and amount of these expenditures are subject to regulatory and other uncertainties  as well as obtaining the necessary permits and approvals 
lyondell  equistar and lcr are still assessing the impact of the new hrvoc control requirements 
there can be no guarantee as to the ultimate cost of implementing any final plan developed to ensure ozone attainment by the deadline 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters 
in the united states  the clean air act amendments of set minimum levels for oxygenates  such as mtbe  in gasoline sold in areas not meeting specified air quality standards 
however  the presence of mtbe in some water supplies in california and other states due to gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks and in surface water from recreational water craft has led to public concern about the use of mtbe 
certain us states 
table of contents have banned the use of mtbe  while other us federal and state governmental initiatives have sought either to rescind the oxygen requirement for reformulated gasoline or to restrict or also ban the use of mtbe 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations environmental matters for further discussion regarding these us federal and state initiatives and their potential impact on lyondell  including potential capital expenditures required for lyondell to produce alternative gasoline blending components 
the clean air act also specified certain emissions standards for vehicles and  in  the epa concluded that additional controls on gasoline and diesel fuel were necessary 
new standards for gasoline were finalized in and will require refiners to produce a low sulfur gasoline by  with final compliance by a new on road diesel standard was adopted in january and will require refiners of on road diesel to produce as ultra low sulfur diesel by june  and by the end of  with less stringent standards for off road diesel fuel 
these gasoline and diesel fuel standards will result in increased capital investment for lcr 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations environmental matters for a summary of the estimated capital expenditures required for lcr to comply with these standards 
in addition to the environmental matters described above  lyondell and its joint ventures are subject to other material regulatory requirements  including those relating to the shipment or exportation of their products 
although lyondell and its joint ventures have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations  lyondell and its joint ventures are subject to the risk that their compliance with such regulations could be challenged 
non compliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs  penalties or assessments that could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of lyondell and its joint ventures 
operating hazards the occurrence of material operating problems at lyondell s or its joint ventures facilities  including  but not limited to  the events described below  may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility  or on the company as a whole  during and after the period of such operational difficulties 
the company s income and cash flow are dependent on the continued operation of the company s and its joint ventures various production facilities and the ability to complete construction projects on schedule 
although the company and its joint ventures take precautions to enhance the safety of their operations and minimize the risk of disruptions  the company s and its joint ventures operations  along with the operations of other members of the chemical and refining industries  are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials  products and wastes 
these hazards include pipeline leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  severe weather and natural disasters  mechanical failures  unscheduled downtimes  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  remediation complications  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases  storage tank leaks  other environmental risks  and potential terrorist acts 
some of these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage  and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
furthermore  the company and its joint ventures are also subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure  workers compensation and other matters 
the company and its joint ventures maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance which they believe are in accordance with customary industry practices  but they are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to their businesses  including losses resulting from war risks or terrorist acts 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and  in some instances  certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
if the company or its joint ventures were to incur a significant liability for which they were not fully insured  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s or its joint ventures financial position 
joint venture risks a substantial portion of the company s operations is conducted through joint ventures 
the company shares control of these joint ventures with third parties 
the company s forecasts and plans with respect to these joint ventures assume that its joint venture partners will observe their joint venture obligations 
in the event that any of the company s joint venture partners do not observe their joint venture obligations  it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with its business plans or that the company would be required to increase its level of commitment in order to give effect to such plans 

table of contents as with any such joint venture arrangements  differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters  potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn the business and operations of the company 
lyondell or any of the other owners of the joint ventures may transfer control of their joint venture interests or engage in mergers or other business combination transactions with a third party or the other owner that could result in a change in control of lyondell or the joint venture or the other owner 
in many instances  such a transfer would be subject to an obligation to first offer the other owner an opportunity to purchase the interest 
lyondell and the other joint venture owners have discussed  and from time to time may continue to discuss  in connection with their ordinary course dialog regarding the joint ventures or otherwise  transactions that could result in a transfer or modification  directly or indirectly  of their ownership in a joint venture 
for example  in august  lyondell purchased occidental s ownership interest in equistar 
lyondell cannot be certain that any of the joint venture owners will not sell  transfer or otherwise modify their ownership interest in a joint venture  whether in a transaction involving third parties and or the other owner 
upon a transfer of an interest in equistar  the partnership agreement and key agreements between equistar and its owners would remain in place  and may not be modified without the consent of all of the owners  but the transfer could affect the governance of equistar  particularly because equistar s partnership agreement requires unanimous approval for some decisions 
equistar s credit facility provides that an event of default occurs if lyondell  millennium and or occidental or their successors collectively  the original owners cease to collectively hold more than of the interests and voting power in equistar 
in addition  an event of default occurs under equistar s credit facility if a party other than an original owner acquires a substantial portion of lyondell s partnership governance committee powers  acquires the right to exercise powers of the partnership governance committee that require unanimous consent or owns more than of the interests and voting power in equistar and has a debt rating below a specified level 
an event of default under equistar s credit facility would permit the lenders to declare amounts outstanding under the credit facility immediately due and payable  terminate future commitments and proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness under the credit facility  which consists of substantially all of equistar s personal property  including inventory 
if the lenders under the credit facility accelerated their loans  it could result in a default under equistar s outstanding notes  which then could be accelerated 
these events of default under equistar s credit facility also are events of termination under equistar s accounts receivable sales facility 
an event of termination under equistar s accounts receivable sales facility terminates the accounts receivable sales program such that additional accounts receivable may not be sold under the facility and the then existing purchasers of accounts receivable would receive all collections from equistar s sold accounts receivable until they have collected on their interests in the purchased accounts receivable 
lcr s credit facility provides that an event of default occurs if lyondell and citgo cease to individually or collectively hold at least a interest 
in addition  lcr s credit facility provides that an event of default occurs if lyondell transfers its interest as a member of lcr to a person other than an affiliate or neither citgo nor any of its affiliates is a member of lcr 
potential acquisitions  divestitures and joint ventures lyondell and its joint ventures continuously seek opportunities to generate value through business combinations  purchases and sales of assets and contractual arrangements or joint ventures 
these transactions are intended to result in the realization of synergies  the creation of efficiencies or the generation of cash to reduce debt 
to the extent permitted under lyondell s and its joint ventures credit facilities and other debt agreements  some of these transactions may be financed with additional borrowings by lyondell or its joint ventures or by the issuance of equity securities 
although these transactions are expected to yield longer term benefits if the expected efficiencies and synergies of the transactions are realized  they could adversely affect the results of operations of lyondell or its joint ventures in the short term because of the costs associated with such transactions 
other transactions may advance future cash flows from some of lyondell s or its joint ventures businesses  thereby yielding increased short term liquidity  but consequently resulting in lower cash flows from these operations over the longer term 

table of contents forward looking statements certain of the statements contained in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
forward looking statements can be identified by words such as estimate  believe  expect  anticipate  plan  budget or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
many of these forward looking statements have been based on expectations and assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate 
while management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable  they are inherently subject to significant business  economic  competitive  regulatory and other risks  contingencies and uncertainties  most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond lyondell s control 
lyondell s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries  the availability  cost and price volatility of raw materials and utilities  uncertainties associated with the united states and worldwide economies  including those due to political tensions in the middle east and elsewhere  current and potential governmental regulatory actions in the united states and regulatory actions and political unrest in other countries  industry production capacities and operating rates  the supply demand balances for lyondell s and its joint ventures products  competitive products and pricing pressures  access to capital markets  terrorist acts  operating interruptions including leaks  explosions  fires  weather related incidents  mechanical failures  unscheduled downtimes  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  spills and releases and other environmental risks  technological developments  and lyondell s ability to implement its business strategies 
any of these factors  or a combination of these factors  could materially affect lyondell s or its joint ventures future results of operations and the ultimate accuracy of the forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of lyondell s or its joint ventures future performance  and lyondell s or its joint ventures actual results and future developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements

table of contents non gaap financial measures the body of generally accepted accounting principles is commonly referred to as gaap 
for this purpose  a non gaap financial measure is generally defined by the securities and exchange commission as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable us gaap measure 
from time to time lyondell discloses so called non gaap financial measures  primarily ebitda  or earnings before interest  taxes depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  as well as proportionate share data for lyondell and its joint ventures 
the non gaap financial measures described herein are not a substitute for the gaap measures of earnings  for which management has responsibility 
lyondell sometimes uses ebitda in its communications with investors  financial analysts and the public 
management believes that disclosure of ebitda can provide useful information to investors  financial analysts and the public in their review of lyondell s operating performance and liquidity and their comparison of lyondell s operating performance and liquidity to the operating performance and liquidity of other companies in the same industry and other industries 
this is because ebitda is perceived as a more objective and comparable measure of operating performance and liquidity 
for example  interest expense is dependent on the capital structure and credit rating of a company 
however  debt levels  credit ratings and  therefore  the impact of interest expense on earnings vary in significance between companies 
similarly  the tax positions of individual companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits  with the result that their effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably 
finally  companies differ in the age and method of acquisition of productive assets  and thus the relative costs of those assets  as well as in the depreciation straight line  accelerated  units of production method  which can result in considerable variability in depreciation and amortization expense between companies 
thus  for comparison purposes  management believes that ebitda can be useful as an objective and comparable measure of operating profitability and the contribution of operations to liquidity because it excludes these elements of earnings that do not provide information about the current operations of existing assets 
accordingly  management believes that disclosure of ebitda can provide useful information to investors  financial analysts and the public in their evaluation of companies operating performance and the contribution of operations to liquidity 
lyondell also reports certain proportionate share data for lyondell and its joint ventures 
the joint ventures are not consolidated  but are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  in lyondell s financial statements investors only see a single line item investments for the joint ventures in the balance sheet and one line item equity income from joint venture investments in the income statement 
therefore  investors may not get a complete appreciation of the magnitude of certain operating and financial measures for lyondell and its joint ventures and the scope of their business activities 
management believes that reporting certain proportionate share data may give investors a more complete picture of the size and scope of the operating activities of lyondell and its joint ventures 
lyondell also periodically reports adjusted net income loss or adjusted ebitda  excluding specified items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period and that are included in gaap measures of earnings 
management believes that excluding these items generally helps investors compare operating performance between two periods 
such adjusted data is always reported with an explanation of the items that are excluded 
item legal proceedings litigation matters on february   lcr filed a lawsuit against pdvsa and pdvsa oil in the united states district court  southern district of new york in connection with various force majeure declarations since april in the lawsuit  lcr alleges that the force majeure declarations by pdvsa and pdvsa oil are invalid and that pdvsa and pdvsa oil have breached the contracts related to the delivery of crude oil by pdvsa and pdvsa oil to lcr 
lcr is seeking monetary damages of at least million resulting from pdvsa oil s failure to pay lcr the amounts required by contract relating to past crude oil deliveries of less than the contractual amount 
lcr also is seeking declaratory relief relating to the force majeure declarations  and is seeking a declaratory interpretation of the disputed contract provisions in order to clarify the rights and obligations of the parties for the remaining duration of 
table of contents the contracts  which expire in december on may   the defendants filed a motion to dismiss lcr s complaint on the ground that the act of state doctrine prevented the court from deciding lcr s breach of contract claims 
on august   the court denied the defendants motion to dismiss lcr s claims based on the act of state doctrine 
the company and its joint ventures are  from time to time  defendants in lawsuits  some of which are not covered by insurance 
many of these suits make no specific claim for relief 
although final determination of legal liability and the resulting financial impact with respect to any such litigation cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty  the company does not believe that any ultimate uninsured liability resulting from the legal proceedings in which it or its joint ventures currently are involved directly or indirectly will individually  or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the company 
however  the adverse resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these suits could have a material impact on lyondell s results of operations for that period  which may be mitigated by contribution or indemnification obligations of co defendants or others  or by any insurance coverage that may be available 
although lyondell and its joint ventures are involved in numerous and varied legal proceedings  a significant portion of their outstanding litigation arose in four contexts claims for personal injury or death allegedly arising out of exposure to the products produced by or located on the premises of the respective entities  claims for personal injury or death  and or property damage allegedly arising out of the generation and disposal of chemical wastes at superfund and other waste disposal sites  claims for personal injury and or property damage allegedly arising out of operations and air  noise and water pollution allegedly arising out of operations  and employment related claims 
environmental proceedings from time to time the company and its joint ventures receive notices from federal  state or local governmental entities of alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to  among other things  the disposal  emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances  including hazardous wastes 
although the company and its joint ventures have not been the subject of significant penalties to date  such alleged violations may become the subject of enforcement actions or other legal proceedings and may individually or in the aggregate involve monetary sanctions of  or more exclusive of interest and costs 
in april  the illinois attorney general s office filed a complaint in grundy county  illinois circuit court seeking monetary sanctions for releases into the environment at millennium s morris  illinois plant in alleged violation of state regulations 
the morris  illinois plant was contributed to equistar on december  in connection with the formation of equistar 
equistar has reached a tentative settlement with the state of illinois  which includes a civil penalty in the amount of  and is finalizing the settlement consent decree with the state of illinois

subject to the uncertainty inherent in all litigation  management believes the resolution of the matters pursuant to these indemnity agreements will not have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial statements of the company 
lyondell s environmental liability totaled million at december  based on the company s latest assessment of potential future remediation costs 
this amount comprises liability for remediation responsibility relating to current and former plant sites  and a limited number of superfund sites 
lyondell also is involved in administrative proceedings or lawsuits relating to a minimal number of superfund sites 
the company estimates  based on currently available information  that potential loss contingencies associated with its sites  individually and in the aggregate  are not significant 
however  it is possible that new information about the sites for which the accrual has been established  new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies  could require the company to reassess its potential exposure related to environmental matters

in response to the higher raw material and energy costs  lyondell and equistar implemented significant sales price increases in for substantially all of their products 
raw material and energy cost increases of nearly billion were recovered through sales price increases in by lyondell and equistar combined 
the magnitude of these price increases had a negative effect on product demand 
while lyondell  nonetheless  experienced growth in sales volumes  equistar experienced lower sales volumes  particularly in the second quarter although demand for equistar s products recovered during the second half of  equistar s sales volumes were lower in total compared to

as a result of the re design of the low sulfur gasoline project in  lcr recognized impairment of value of million of costs incurred to date for the project 
lyondell s proportionate share of this charge was million before tax 
in  compared to  the chemical industry experienced weaker demand growth and ongoing excess capacity 
the excess capacity put downward pressure on prices and  as a result  on margins 
lyondell and equistar generally experienced some increased demand for most products during compared to  however  product margins were generally lower than in significant events in included the august acquisition by lyondell of the interest in equistar held by subsidiaries of occidental petroleum corporation together with its subsidiaries and affiliates  collectively occidental

income tax the effective tax rate was compared to in and in the effective rates for all periods presented reflected a tax benefit from operating losses incurred during the year 
the tax benefit exceeded the statutory federal rate due to benefits that reduced taxes on non us income  including benefits associated with the internal financing of the maasvlakte po sm plant construction 
the lower rate reflected the effect of taxes on non us earnings 
the effective tax rate also reflected the effect of non us earnings taxed at higher rates  as well as other items  but these were offset by a benefit from a change in estimate of prior year items 
the change in estimate of prior year items primarily represented certain tax effects related to the sale of assets in 
table of contents net loss lyondell had a net loss of million in  million in and million in the increased net loss in compared to was primarily due to weaker operating results in lyondell s ic d segment and at equistar 
lyondell s ic d segment was negatively impacted by lower mtbe margins and volumes  including the expiration  at the end of  of a favorable mtbe sales contract 
equistar s operating results were affected by lower sales volumes in compared to lyondell s net losses in and of million and million  respectively  were comparable

the net loss reflected lower product margins at lyondell and equistar in as a result of ongoing industry overcapacity 
fourth quarter versus third quarter lyondell s fourth quarter net loss of million compares to a net loss for the third quarter of million 
the decrease in profitability in the fourth quarter was due to lyondell s share of lower equistar results  including refinancing charges incurred by equistar during the fourth quarter  as well as lower operating results in lyondell s ic d segment 
equistar s operating results were affected by higher raw material costs  while the ic d segment was affected by lower mtbe margins and volumes in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter intermediate chemicals and derivatives segment overview the ic d segment produces and markets po  po derivatives  such as propylene glycol pg  propylene glycol ethers pge  and butanediol bdo  toluene diisocyanate tdi  styrene monomer sm or styrene and methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  the principal derivative of tertiary butyl alcohol tba 
sm and tba are co products of lyondell s two major po production processes  referred to as po sm and po tba 
in  ic d operating results were negatively impacted by the phase out  in several us states  of mtbe and the expiration of a favorable mtbe sales contract  as well as experiencing high and volatile raw material and energy costs and ongoing excess industry capacity 
lyondell also started production at its maasvlakte po sm plant and restructured its joint venture in japan 
during  several major oil companies substantially reduced or discontinued the use of mtbe in gasoline produced for california markets 
in addition  new york  connecticut  and california banned the use of mtbe effective january  lyondell believes that these actions created a supply demand imbalance with the result that market mtbe margins were significantly lower in compared to in addition  a favorable mtbe sales contract expired at the end of  contributing to lower mtbe margins in compared to mtbe industry capacity was reduced during as a result of the shutdown of some higher cost mtbe production facilities by other producers  which relieved some of the oversupply 
the cost of propylene  consistent with other raw material costs  escalated during the first half of the benchmark price of propylene averaged higher in the us and higher in europe in than in the ic d segment also experienced higher energy costs due to significant increases in natural gas prices compared to lyondell implemented sales price increases for products in the ic d segment in in response to the higher raw material and energy costs

the agreements also include provisions for the cross licensing of certain technology rights  construction of a new propylene glycol pg plant by nihon oxirane  and changes in operations agreed to by the partners to expand nihon oxirane s market position in asia for po and pg and to improve nihon oxirane s cost structure 
in addition  under the new agreements  a po plant in chiba  japan constructed by lyondell s joint venture partner  which began production in the second quarter  is expected to be transferred to nihon oxirane by in  compared to  the ic d segment benefited from stronger demand  including increased demand in end use markets for po and derivatives  such as automotive  housing and home furnishings 
this resulted in generally higher sales volumes in compared to however  the increased demand did not benefit industry margins for po derivatives  which continued to be negatively affected by industry overcapacity

the purchases for resale  principally styrene  will be substantially replaced by production volumes with the startup of the new maasvlakte po sm plant in the netherlands  in the fourth quarter revenues revenues of billion in increased from revenues of billion in due primarily to higher average sales prices and the foreign exchange effect of a weaker us dollar 
sales volumes for po and derivatives and styrene increased but were partly offset by lower mtbe volumes 
average sales prices in for most products were higher in response to the higher raw material and natural gas costs in sales volumes for po and derivatives increased  including bdo  deicers and pg  reflecting increased demand  a full year of production from the botlek bdo plant and more severe weather  which increased deicer demand 
these higher volumes were partly offset by lower tdi sales volumes 
sales volumes increased for styrene in compared to  as a result of increased us spot sales 
sales volumes for mtbe and other tba derivatives decreased on lower mtbe demand 

table of contents revenues of billion in increased from billion in as higher sales volumes were substantially offset by lower sales prices 
sales volumes for po and derivatives increased primarily due to higher demand for po in urethanes markets and higher bdo volumes due to the botlek bdo plant startup in these higher volumes were partly offset by lower tdi sales volumes  due to tdi maintenance turnarounds  and the shut down of lyondell s adi operations in the third quarter sales volumes also increased for sm and for tba and derivatives  primarily mtbe  in compared to higher sm sales volumes in reflected the expected startup of the maasvlakte po sm plant in the netherlands and higher export sales  primarily to asia 
the lower average sales prices were primarily due to lower sales prices for po and derivatives and mtbe 
the lower po and derivatives average sales prices  to a large extent  reflected weaker demand for po derivatives and industry overcapacity 
the lower mtbe average sales prices primarily reflected lower gasoline prices in compared to operating income loss the operating loss in of million compares to operating income in of million 
the million decrease in operating results was primarily due to lower mtbe margins and volumes and  to a lesser extent  lower volumes and margins for tdi 
these effects were partly offset by improved results for po and derivatives 
the lower mtbe margins and volumes reflected decreased mtbe demand  the expiration of the favorable mtbe sales contract and higher raw material and energy costs related to high natural gas costs in the us mtbe demand decreased as use of mtbe was phased out in certain key states 
higher po and derivatives sales volumes and prices more than offset the effect of higher operating costs  which were primarily due to higher us natural gas costs and the new botlek bdo plant 
operating income of million in increased million from million in  primarily reflecting a million restructuring charge and million of goodwill amortization in operating results in reflected lower product margins for po derivatives and higher fixed costs  due to the startup of the new botlek bdo plant 
these negative effects in were partly offset by the benefits of higher sm and tdi margins  higher sales volumes and the exit from the unprofitable adi business in the third quarter lower po derivatives margins reflected a weaker pricing environment in as noted above 
higher sm margins reflected a stronger sm market in most of compared to tdi margins improved on lower raw materials costs and supply shortages that led to higher sales prices in fourth quarter versus third quarter fourth quarter operating income of million decreased million from third quarter operating income of million 
the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of lower sales margins and volumes for mtbe 
po and derivatives and tdi operating results improved primarily due to higher product margins 
third quarter mtbe margins were unusually strong around the labor day holiday but experienced a typical fourth quarter seasonal slowdown and margin pressure 
the mtbe market was also impacted by the final steps of the california mtbe phase out and the initial effects of the pending phase outs in new york and connecticut  effective january  fourth quarter po and derivatives prices increased  while raw material costs were relatively unchanged 
volumes increased  reflecting seasonal deicer sales 
a key event during the fourth quarter was the startup of the maasvlakte po sm plant in europe late in the quarter 

table of contents equistar chemicals  lp overview equistar produces and markets olefins  including ethylene  propylene  and butadiene  aromatics  including benzene and toluene  and oxygenated products  including ethylene oxide and derivatives  ethylene glycol  ethanol and mtbe in its petrochemicals segment 
additionally  equistar produces and markets polyolefins  including high density polyethylene hdpe  low density polyethylene ldpe  linear low density polyethylene lldpe and polypropylene  and performance polymers products  including wire and cable insulating resins  and polymeric powders in its polymers segment 
in  the chemical industry experienced high and volatile raw material and energy costs  continuing weak demand and ongoing excess industry capacity 
preliminary estimates by cmai indicate that us industry ethylene demand in decreased slightly compared to benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of movement of raw material and energy costs for equistar 
olefins are produced from two major raw material groups crude oil based liquids liquids  including naphthas  condensates  and gas oils  the prices of which are generally related to crude oil prices  and natural gas liquids ngls  principally ethane and propane  the prices of which are generally affected by natural gas prices 
equistar has the ability to shift its ratio of raw materials used in production of olefins to take advantage of the relative costs of liquids and ngls 
raw material and energy costs averaged significantly higher in than in  putting upward pressure on raw material costs for the chemical industry  including equistar 
in response to the higher raw material and energy costs  equistar implemented significant sales price increases in for substantially all of its petrochemicals and polymers products 
raw material and energy cost increases of nearly billion were recovered through sales price increases in the magnitude of these price increases had a negative effect on product demand  and contributed to equistar experiencing lower sales volumes  particularly in the second quarter although demand recovered during the second half of  sales volumes were lower for the year compared to in  equistar issued million of new senior unsecured notes  deferring debt maturities  restructured its credit facility and entered into a new receivables sales facility to maintain its liquidity 
these actions resulted in million of financing fees and related expenses in in march  equistar completed transactions involving a year propylene supply arrangement and the sale of its bayport polypropylene production facility in pasadena  texas 
equistar received total cash proceeds of million  including the value of the polypropylene inventory sold 
cash proceeds of million of the total represented a partial prepayment under the long term propylene supply arrangement 
equistar also took steps in to refocus its research and development r d activities  resulting in the write off of an r d facility and incurrence of employee severance costs 
equistar also completed scheduled maintenance turnarounds at its two largest ethylene plants in while negatively impacting raw material flexibility in  conclusion of these turnarounds increases equistar s future production flexibility 
in  compared to  the chemical industry experienced weak demand growth and ongoing excess capacity 
for the year  us industry ethylene demand grew  compared to  which failed to absorb excess ethylene industry capacity 
this continued to put downward pressure on industry prices and as a result  on product margins 
overall  equistar experienced lower product margins in than in 
table of contents results of operations net loss equistar had a net loss of million compared to a net loss of million  before the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the million higher loss in included million of refinancing costs  a million loss on the sale of the polypropylene plant  an million charge for the write off of a polymer r d facility and million of employee severance costs 
the loss included the negative impact of certain fixed price natural gas and ngl purchase contracts 
equistar s costs under these contracts were approximately million higher than market based costs would have been 
the remaining million decrease in operating results was primarily due to lower sales volumes  which were only partly offset by higher average product margins in in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses in were million higher than in  reflecting higher pension and medical benefit costs and a higher provision for doubtful accounts 
equistar had a net loss of million  before the cumulative effect of an accounting change  compared to a net loss of million 
the loss included the million negative impact of the fixed price natural gas and ngl purchase contracts 
the period included million of goodwill amortization  million of shutdown costs for equistar s port arthur  texas polyethylene facility and a million negative impact from the fixed price natural gas and ngl contracts 
apart from these items  the increase in the net loss primarily reflected a million decrease in petrochemicals segment operating income  partly offset by a million improvement in the polymers segment operating loss 
petrochemicals segment operating income decreased as sales prices decreased more than raw material costs  resulting in lower petrochemicals product margins in compared to the polymers segment operating loss was reduced as raw material costs  primarily ethylene and propylene  decreased more than the decreases in average polymers product sales prices  resulting in higher polymers product margins in compared to fourth quarter versus third quarter equistar had a net loss of million in the fourth quarter compared to a net loss of million in the third quarter equistar s fourth quarter operations were negatively impacted by an increase in the cost of ethylene production driven by higher prices for raw materials and energy 
equistar responded with price increases  but the timing of the price increases was such that they were insufficient to fully offset the cost increases 
the benchmark cost of ethylene production was over cents per pound higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter  while benchmark ethylene sales prices increased by less than cent per pound 
additionally  a scheduled maintenance turnaround at an ethylene plant during the fourth quarter had a modest negative impact on operations by affecting equistar s ability to optimize its raw material utilization 
the fourth quarter included million of finance charges and million of severance costs  while the third quarter included the million charge for the write off of the polymer r d facility 
sales volumes continued to improve during the fourth quarter versus the third quarter sales of ethylene and ethylene derivatives increased by approximately percent 
sales volumes typically decrease in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter

benchmark ethylene prices averaged higher in compared to in response to significant increases in the cost of ethylene production  while benchmark propylene sales prices averaged higher 
segment sales volumes decreased in compared to due to lower sales to the polymers segment and lower co product production in lower co product production reflected the scheduled maintenance turnarounds at two major ethylene plants in revenues of billion in decreased compared to revenues of billion in as lower average sales prices were only partly offset by a increase in sales volumes 
equistar s sales prices in averaged lower than in  reflecting lower raw material costs and low demand growth coupled with excess industry capacity 
benchmark ethylene sales prices averaged cents per pound in  a decrease compared to these lower ethylene sales prices were slightly offset by higher propylene sales prices 
benchmark propylene sales prices averaged higher in than in operating income the operating income for the segment of million in decreased million compared to operating income of million in operating income for included the million negative effect of the fixed price natural gas and ngl purchase contracts entered into in early the decrease in operating income was due to the negative effect of two scheduled maintenance turnarounds and lower sales volumes 
operating income of million in decreased million from million in as sales prices decreased more than raw material costs  resulting in lower product margins 
the effect of the lower product margins was only partly offset by the benefit of a increase in sales volumes  which was in line with industry demand growth 

table of contents polymers segment revenues revenues of  million in increased compared to revenues of  million in the increase was due to a increase in average sales prices partly offset by a decrease in sales volumes 
average sales prices increased in response to higher raw material costs  primarily ethylene  compared to the average benchmark price of ethylene increased in compared to the lower polymers sales volumes reflected the negative effect of the higher sales prices on demand and  to a lesser extent  the sale of the bayport polypropylene production facility in revenues of  million in decreased compared to revenues of  million in due to a decrease in average sales prices offset by a increase in sales volumes 
lower sales prices in reflected generally lower raw material costs compared to sales volumes increased due to stronger demand in compared to operating loss the polymers segment had an operating loss of million in compared to an operating loss of million in the combined effects of the million write off and the million loss on sale noted above  as well as the negative effect of the decrease in sales volumes  was substantially offset by higher polymer product margins 
margins increased in compared to as higher average sales prices more than offset higher raw material costs 
the operating loss of million in decreased million compared to the operating loss of million in the million improvement was due to higher polymers product margins and  to a lesser extent  higher sales volumes 
margins improved in compared to  as decreases in sales prices were less than the decreases in polymers raw material costs 
unallocated items the following discusses costs and expenses that were not allocated to the petrochemicals or polymers segments 
other operating costs and expenses these include unallocated general and administrative expenses and  in  goodwill amortization 
unallocated expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase from to was primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses due to higher pension and medical benefit costs and a higher provision for doubtful accounts 
the decrease from to was primarily due to goodwill amortization of million that ceased in and the million of shutdown costs in equistar discontinued production at its higher cost port arthur  texas polyethylene facility in february and shut down the facility 
during  equistar recorded a million charge  which included environmental remediation liabilities of million  other exit costs of million and severance and pension benefits of million for approximately people employed at the port arthur facility 
the remaining million balance primarily related to the write down of certain assets 

table of contents lyondell citgo refining lp lyondell s activities in the refining segment are conducted through its interest in lcr 
refining segment overview lcr produces refined petroleum products  including gasoline  low sulfur diesel  jet fuel  aromatics and lubricants 
pdvsa petr leo  sa pdvsa oil supplies extra heavy venezuelan crude oil to lcr under a long term crude supply agreement crude supply agreement or csa see crude supply agreement section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
under the csa  lcr purchases  barrels per day of extra heavy crude oil  which constitutes approximately of its refining capacity of  barrels per day 
lcr purchases the balance of its crude oil requirements on the spot market 
profit margins on spot market crude oil tend to be more volatile than margins on csa crude oil 
in  csa crude oil deliveries for the year were nearly at the contract rate  despite a disruption of csa crude oil deliveries to lcr during january due to the effects of a national strike in venezuela that began in december in  csa crude oil deliveries were below the contract rate as pdvsa oil declared itself in a force majeure situation in january and  beginning in march  reduced deliveries under the csa 
csa deliveries were restored to contract levels in the third quarter during  lcr made increased use of crude oil purchased in the spot market to compensate for the lower csa deliveries 
lcr s csa crude oil processing rates averaged  barrels per day in compared to  barrels per day in during  processing of extra heavy venezuelan crude oil under the csa averaged  barrels per day  despite a major maintenance turnaround at lcr in the fourth quarter as volumes were accelerated into the first nine months of this resulted in higher than contract level csa crude oil processing rates during the first nine months of  allowing lcr to attain the near contract processing rate of  barrels per day for the full year a strong gasoline market continued through the third quarter  benefiting lcr s margins on spot purchases of crude oil 
during  lcr developed an alternative approach to complying with a mandated low sulfur gasoline standard  which will lead to a reduction in overall capital expenditures for the project 
as a result  in  lcr recognized impairment of value of million of costs related to the project 
see clean air act section of note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents revenues revenues for lcr  including intersegment sales  were billion in  billion in and billion in revenues for increased compared to the increase was primarily due to higher sales prices for refined products 
average sales prices for refined products during were higher than in while total crude processing rates increased by only from to  this represented an increase in csa crude processing rates of  barrels per day offset by a  barrel per day decrease in spot market crude processing rates 
revenues for increased compared to the increase was primarily due to a increase in sales volumes  partly offset by lower sales prices 
total crude processing rates averaged  barrels per day in  a increase compared to  barrels per day in however  processing rates of spot market crude  which was less profitable than csa crude oil  averaged  barrels per day in compared to  barrels per day in as a result of lower csa crude oil deliveries in interest expense lcr s net interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest expense included interest on loans payable to partners of million in  million in and million in interest expense increased in compared to primarily as a result of higher debt issuance cost amortization  which reflects the higher debt issuance costs associated with the current credit facility 
interest expense decreased in compared to due to lower interest rates under lcr s variable rate debt  and lower amortization expense related to debt issuance costs 
lcr s debt was refinanced in july and december net income lcr s net income was million in  million in and million in the million increase in net income in compared to was due to the benefit from processing higher volumes of higher margin csa crude oil and higher product margins for aromatics and lubricants in these benefits were partially offset by the negative effect in of higher natural gas costs  the million charge related to the previously capitalized costs for the low sulfur gasoline project  and a million charge related to personnel reductions 
while lcr s net income of million was comparable to net income of million in  there were significant offsetting factors 
in  as noted in the overview above  lcr s net income was negatively impacted by lower csa crude oil deliveries compared to lcr maintained crude oil processing levels through increased purchases of spot market crude oil  which had significantly lower margins in compared to and compared to csa crude oil margins 
the negative effects of lower csa volumes and lower spot margins in were partly offset by lower energy costs and lower interest costs compared to in addition  a major planned maintenance turnaround in the fourth quarter and an outage related to tropical storm allison in the second quarter negatively affected operating results 
fourth quarter versus third quarter lcr s fourth quarter net income of million was comparable to net income of million in the third quarter as csa crude oil volumes and total crude oil volumes were relatively unchanged 
lcr operated at nearly full capacity during the fourth quarter total crude oil processing rates in fourth quarter averaged  barrels per day  while csa crude oil processing rates averaged  barrels per day

in august  lyondell increased its equity interest in equistar by acquiring occidental s interest 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  lyondell currently has a interest in equistar 
in connection with the acquisition  lyondell issued common stock  warrants and a contingent right to occidental chemical holding corporation 
these transactions included concurrent payments between the parties of agreed amounts of approximately million 
the agreed amounts exchanged are included in cash used in investing activities and cash provided by financing activities 
financing activities in october  lyondell sold million shares of original common stock  including million shares purchased by occidental chemical holding corporation 
lyondell used the net proceeds of approximately million to enhance liquidity and for general corporate purposes 
in may  lyondell issued million of senior secured notes due in september the proceeds  net of related fees  of million were used to prepay the million outstanding balance of term loan e and to finance the purchase of the botlek bdo plant that lyondell previously leased 
the related lease was terminated 

table of contents in march  lyondell obtained amendments to its credit facility to provide additional financial flexibility by easing certain financial ratio requirements 
see long term debt section of contractual and other obligations below 
in december  lyondell issued million of senior secured notes due  using net proceeds  after discount and fees  of million to prepay million of the principal amount outstanding under term loan e of the credit facility and to pay a million prepayment premium 
in august  lyondell completed certain transactions with occidental chemical holding corporation ochc 
as a result of these transactions  ochc received an equity interest in lyondell  including million shares of newly issued lyondell series b common stock  five year warrants to acquire five million shares of lyondell original common stock at per share  and a right to a contingent payment equivalent in value to of equistar s cash distributions related to and there were no distributions by equistar in or  and the right to a contingent payment expired with no payments made thereunder 
as a result of the transactions with ochc  lyondell has two series of common stock outstanding  original common stock and series b common stock 
lyondell paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of per share of original common stock in each of the four quarters of  totaling million 
lyondell elected to pay the regular quarterly dividends on each share of outstanding series b common stock in kind  or a total of million and million shares of series b common stock during and  respectively 
following these transactions  including the million common shares purchased by ochc in october  and the payment of dividends to ochc in the form of shares of series b common stock  ochc owns a equity interest in lyondell as of december  in july  lyondell completed debt and equity offerings  as well as amendments to its credit facility that made certain financial ratio requirements less restrictive 
lyondell issued million of senior secured notes due  using proceeds of million to prepay million of the principal amount outstanding under term loan e of the credit facility and to pay a million prepayment premium 
the remaining net proceeds of approximately million were used for general corporate purposes 
lyondell also issued million shares of common stock  receiving net proceeds of million that were used for general corporate purposes 
also  in july  after receiving consents from the holders of the senior secured and senior subordinated notes  lyondell amended the indentures related to those notes 
the principal indenture amendment revised a limitation that had restricted payment of lyondell s current per share annual cash dividend to a specified number of shares 
as a result of the amendment  the number of shares with respect to which the per share annual cash dividend may be paid is no longer restricted by the indenture covenants 
lyondell paid fees totaling million related to the amendments to the indentures and the credit facility 
lyondell had previously obtained amendments to the credit facility and the financial ratio requirements in september and march lyondell also made debt payments of million during primarily using proceeds of certain asset sales  principally assets related to the adi business  as required by the terms of the credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources lyondell s balance sheet remains highly leveraged 
as of december   long term debt  including current maturities  totaled billion  or approximately of total capitalization 
in addition  as of december  lyondell s joint ventures had approximately billion of debt and lyondell remains contingently liable as a guarantor of million of that debt 

table of contents in november  moody s investors service moody s lowered lyondell s senior secured debt rating from ba to b during  standard poor s rating service s p lowered lyondell s senior secured debt rating from bb to bb  and  in january  s p further lowered it from bb to b  citing weaker than expected fourth quarter and full year operating results  uncertainties regarding mtbe and dependence on lcr s cash distributions 
s p also changed the outlook for lyondell from negative to stable  citing prudent steps taken by management to extend debt maturities and maintain liquidity in a difficult business environment 
one or more of the rating agencies may reduce lyondell s ratings in the future  whether as the result of adverse developments affecting lyondell s or its joint ventures business  events beyond their control or other reasons cited by the agencies 
a downgrade in debt rating could affect lyondell s trade terms  borrowing costs and its ability to refinance or restructure debt in the future 
lyondell s ability to pay or refinance its debt will depend on future operating performance  which could be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
lyondell believes that conditions will be such that cash balances  cash generated from operating activities  cash distributions from joint ventures and funds from lines of credit will be adequate to meet anticipated future cash requirements  including scheduled debt repayments  necessary capital expenditures  ongoing operations and dividends 
however  if future operating cash flows are less than currently anticipated  lyondell may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  or reduce operating expenses 
at december   lyondell had cash on hand of million 
in addition  the million revolving credit facility  which matures in june  was undrawn as of december  amounts available under the revolving credit facility are reduced to the extent of certain outstanding letters of credit provided under the credit facility  which totaled million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements the securities and exchange commission sec has described various characteristics to identify contractual arrangements that would fall within the sec s definition of off balance sheet arrangements 
lyondell is a party to the following arrangements that have some of those characteristics accounts receivable sales facility in december  lyondell entered into a new million  four year  accounts receivable sales facility to replace its previous accounts receivable sales program 
pursuant to the facility  lyondell sells  through a wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary  on an ongoing basis and without recourse  an interest in a pool of domestic accounts receivable to financial institutions participating in the facility 
lyondell is responsible for servicing the receivables 
the amount of interest in the pool of receivables permitted to be sold is determined by a formula 
the agreement currently permits the sale of up to million of total interest in domestic accounts receivable  which was the balance sold under the new facility as of december  at december   the balance sold under the previous arrangement was million 
accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets are reduced by the sales of interest in the pool 
the facility accelerates availability to the business of cash from product sales that otherwise would have been collected over the normal billing and collection cycle 
the availability of the accounts receivable sales facility provides one element of lyondell s ongoing sources of liquidity and capital resources 
upon termination of the facility  cash collections related to accounts receivable then in the pool would first be applied to the outstanding interest sold  but lyondell would in no event be required to repurchase such interest 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional accounts receivable information 
equity investments in joint ventures lyondell holds variable equity interests in the equistar and lcr joint ventures  and engages in minor research and development activities with equistar 
there are various contractual arrangements for the purchase and sale of product among lyondell and these joint ventures  as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
although lyondell does not believe that these joint venture investments represent the type of arrangement intended to be addressed by the sec s definition of off balance sheet arrangements  each is important to the future liquidity of  and is therefore a capital resource to  lyondell 
although distribution to its owners of the earnings of lcr have represented a source of cash for lyondell in recent years  the debt of lyondell s joint ventures  equistar and lcr  is not a source of liquidity or a capital resource for lyondell 
in the future  as business conditions improve  distribution to its owners of earnings of equistar may be a significant source of liquidity and a capital resource for lyondell 

table of contents the known events and trends affecting these joint ventures are discussed above in the operating results sections and within this financial condition section 
the effects of these investments on lyondell s financial statements are disclosed on the face of the consolidated financial statements and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
guarantee of equistar debt at december   lyondell was guarantor of million of equistar debt as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the guarantee facilitated the formation of equistar as a separate operating company 
lyondell estimates that the fair value of its guarantee is not significant  given the low probability of future payments under the guarantee provision 
contractual and other obligations the following tables summarize  as of december   lyondell s minimum payments for long term debt  and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter 
payments due by period millions of dollars total thereafter contractual obligations long term debt pension and other postretirement benefits other noncurrent obligations deferred income taxes other contractual obligations purchase obligations operating leases total long term debt the secured credit facility and the indentures pertaining to lyondell s senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes contain covenants that  subject to exceptions  restrict sale and leaseback transactions  lien incurrence  debt incurrence  dividends  investments  non regulatory capital expenditures  certain payments  sales of assets and mergers 
in addition  the credit facility requires lyondell to maintain specified financial ratios and consolidated net worth  as defined in the credit facility 
as a result of continuing adverse conditions in the industry  in march  lyondell obtained amendments to its credit facility to provide additional financial flexibility by easing certain financial ratio requirements 
beginning in  the financial ratio requirements under the lyondell credit facility become increasingly restrictive over time 
the breach of these covenants would permit the lenders or noteholders to declare any outstanding debt immediately payable and would permit the lenders under lyondell s credit facility to terminate future lending commitments 
furthermore  under certain circumstances  a default under equistar s debt instruments would constitute a cross default under lyondell s credit facility  which  under certain circumstances  would then constitute a default under lyondell s indentures 
lyondell was in compliance with all such covenants as of december  subsequent to december   as a result of ongoing adverse conditions in the industry  lyondell obtained further amendments to its credit facility to provide additional financial flexibility by easing certain financial ratio requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of lyondell s long term debt and credit facility and the collateral securing certain of lyondell s debt instruments 
pension and other postretirement benefits lyondell maintains several defined benefit pension plans and provides postretirement benefits  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the projected benefit obligation for lyondell s pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million 
subject to future actuarial gains and losses  as well as actual asset earnings  lyondell will be required to fund the million  with interest  in future years 
the minimum required contribution may reach an annual rate of approximately million by  due to past investment losses and relatively low current contribution levels 
pension contributions were million  million and million for the years  and  and are estimated to be approximately million for during and  lyondell recognized an increase in its minimum pension liability of million and million  respectively  with a charge to other comprehensive 
table of contents income 
during  lyondell reduced the minimum pension liability by million largely as a result of improved plan asset performance 
the million cumulative minimum pension liability represents accumulated pension benefit obligations in excess of pension plan assets at december  other postretirement benefits are unfunded and are paid by lyondell as incurred 
estimates of postretirement benefit payments through are included in the table above 
other noncurrent obligations other noncurrent obligations primarily include deferred compensation arrangements other than pension and postretirement benefits and advances from customers 
deferred income taxes the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences  all of which would be fully offset during the first five years by lyondell s tax loss carry forwards 
actual cash tax payments will vary dependent upon future taxable income 
purchase obligations lyondell is a party to various obligations to purchase products and services  principally for utilities and industrial gases 
these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements 
also included in purchase obligations is a commitment to purchase minimum annual quantities of tda from rhodia through and to reimburse rhodia for the costs of operating the tdi facility at pont de claix  france  through march  for which tda is the principal raw material 
the rhodia obligations  denominated in euros  include fixed and variable components 
the actual future obligation will vary with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  market prices of raw materials and other variable cost components such as utility costs 
approximately of the annual payments through and of the annual payments thereafter shown in the table above are subject to such variability 
see the commitments section of note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of lyondell s commitments and contingencies  including these purchase obligations 
operating leases lyondell leases various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 
equistar liquidity and capital resources at december   equistar s long term debt  including current maturities  totaled billion  or approximately of its total capitalization 
equistar had cash on hand of million 
in addition  the total amount available at december  under both the new million inventory based revolving credit facility and the new million accounts receivable sales facility was approximately million  which gives effect to the borrowing base less a million unused availability requirement and is net of the million sold under the accounts receivable facility and million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility 
the borrowing base is determined using a formula applied to accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the new revolving credit facility requires that the unused available amounts under that facility and the million accounts receivable sales facility equal or exceed million through march  and million thereafter or million thereafter if the interest coverage ratio  as defined  is less than there was no borrowing under the revolving credit facility at december  equistar s ability to pay or refinance its debt will depend on future operating performance  which could be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
management believes that conditions will be such that cash balances  cash flow from operations  cash generated from higher utilization of the accounts receivable sales facility and funding under the credit facility will be adequate to meet anticipated future cash requirements  including scheduled debt repayments  other contractual obligations  necessary capital expenditures and ongoing operations 
however  if future operating cash flows are less than currently anticipated due to raw material prices or other factors  equistar may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  or reduce operating expenses

a downgrade in debt rating could affect equistar s trade terms  borrowing costs and its ability to refinance or restructure debt in the future 
accounts receivable sales facility in december  equistar entered into a new million  four year  accounts receivable sales facility to replace its previous accounts receivable sales facility 
pursuant to the facility  equistar sells  through a wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary  on an ongoing basis and without recourse  an interest in a pool of accounts receivable to financial institutions participating in the facility 
equistar is responsible for servicing the receivables 
the new accounts receivable sales facility is subject to substantially the same minimum unused availability requirements and covenant requirements as the new inventory based revolving credit facility 
see discussion of equistar liquidity and capital resources above and discussion of equistar long term debt below 
the breach of these covenants would permit the counterparty to the accounts receivable sales facility to terminate further purchases of equistar s accounts receivable 
the new facility does not contain ratings triggers 
at december  and  the balance of equistar s accounts receivable sold under the facilities was million and million  respectively 
the facility accelerates availability to the business of cash from product sales that otherwise would have been collected over the normal billing and collection cycle 
the availability of the accounts receivable sales facility provides one element of equistar s ongoing sources of liquidity and capital resources 
upon termination of the facility  cash collections related to accounts receivable then in the pool would first be applied to the outstanding interest sold  but equistar would in no event be required to repurchase such interest 
long term debt the new million inventory based revolving credit facility and the indentures governing equistar s senior notes contain covenants that  subject to certain exceptions  restrict lien incurrence  debt incurrence  sales of assets  investments  capital expenditures  certain payments  and mergers 
the breach of these covenants would permit the lenders or noteholders to declare any outstanding debt immediately payable and would permit the lenders under equistar s new credit facility to terminate future lending commitments 
the new credit facility is also subject to minimum unused availability requirements see equistar liquidity and capital resources above 
equistar was in compliance with all covenants under these agreements as of december  lcr liquidity and capital resources lcr maintains a million bank term loan facility and a million working capital revolving credit facility 
the facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of lcr 
amounts available under the revolving credit facility  which was undrawn at december   are reduced to the extent of outstanding letters of credit provided under the facility  which totaled million as of december  lcr was in compliance with all covenants under its debt facilities at december  loans payable to partners at december  included million payable to lyondell and million payable to citgo 
in  lyondell and citgo contributed additional capital to lcr by converting million and million  respectively  of accrued interest on these loans to lcr partners capital 

table of contents at december   lcr had million outstanding under an eighteen month term bank loan facility and a million working capital revolving credit facility the facilities  both of which expire in june management of lcr  lyondell and citgo are pursuing a refinancing of the facilities and expect to complete the refinancing before the facilities expire 
on march   lcr entered into an agreement with a major financial institution to refinance the facilities on a long term basis  with interest of libor plus  but in no event more than libor plus  and with other terms substantially similar to the current facilities 
the closing of the new facility is subject to normal conditions of closing  as well as the maintenance of certain financial and operating ratios 
also  subsequent to december   lyondell and citgo agreed to extend the due date of the loans payable to partners  which were scheduled to mature in december  to march  current business outlook the completion and start up of lyondell s new propylene oxide plant in europe and the completion of scheduled maintenance turnarounds at three of equistar s largest ethylene plants have better positioned the enterprise to take advantage of any recovery in a fourth equistar ethylene plant will begin a scheduled maintenance turnaround in the first quarter of thus far in  lyondell and equistar have seen a continuation of the improvement in product sales volumes experienced in the second half of however  lyondell and equistar product margins are heavily dependent on hydrocarbons pricing  primarily crude oil and natural gas 
thus far in  hydrocarbon prices have remained high and volatile 
lyondell and equistar have responded by implementing product price increases and announcing additional product price increases across the majority of their product lines 
because lyondell and equistar products have broad utilization across the economy  external factors  such as the pace of global economic growth  in addition to raw material pricing  will be important factors to lyondell s and equistar s financial performance during related party transactions lyondell makes significant purchases of raw materials from equistar and provides significant administrative services to equistar 
in addition  equistar and lcr  as well as other parties related to equistar and lcr  engage in significant transactions among themselves 
lyondell believes that such related party transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by third parties on an arm s length basis 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of transactions involving lyondell  equistar and lcr 
transactions between lyondell and occidental  which owns a interest in lyondell  of a trade nature in and were not material 
critical accounting policies lyondell applies those accounting policies that management believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events  consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us lyondell s more critical accounting policies include those related to the basis of presentation  long lived assets  including the costs of major maintenance turnarounds and repairs  accruals for long term employee benefit costs such as pension and postretirement costs  as well as accruals for taxes based on income 
inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management 
management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 
these critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of lyondell s board of directors 
lyondell s significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lyondell and its subsidiaries 
investments in joint ventures where lyondell exerts a certain level of management control  but lacks full decision making ability over all major issues  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
for the major unconsolidated joint ventures  including equistar and lcr  governance of each venture is generally based on equal representation from the partners who jointly control certain key management decisions 
these include approval of the strategic plan  capital expenditures and annual budget  issuance of additional debt and the appointment of executive management of the joint venture 
accordingly  these ventures are carried on the equity method  even though lyondell s ownership percentage may exceed 

table of contents long lived assets with respect to long lived assets  key assumptions include the estimates of useful asset lives and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets 
such estimates could be significantly modified and or the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments  new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages  uncertainties associated with the us and world economies  the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries  and uncertainties associated with governmental actions  whether regulatory or  in the case of lcr  with respect to the csa 
lyondell defers the costs of turnaround maintenance and repair activities in excess of million  amortizing such costs over the period until the next expected major turnaround of the affected unit 
during  and  cash expenditures of million  million and million  respectively  were deferred and are being amortized  generally over to years 
amortization in  and  of previously deferred turnaround costs was million  million and million  respectively 
the estimated useful lives of long lived assets range from to years 
depreciation and amortization of these assets  including amortization of deferred turnaround costs  under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives totaled million in if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation charges would be accelerated 
during  depreciation of property  plant and equipment increased to million from million in  partly due to a reduction in the estimated remaining useful lives of certain production assets 
additional information on long lived assets  deferred turnaround costs and related depreciation and amortization appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
long term employee benefit costs the costs to lyondell of long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement medical and life insurance benefits  are incurred over long periods of time  and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is management s responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties 
it also is management s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 
the current benefit service costs  as well as the existing liabilities  for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis 
the discount rate is a current rate  related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled 
lyondell s assumed discount rate is based on average rates published by moody s and merrill lynch for high quality aa rating ten year fixed income securities 
for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december   lyondell lowered its assumed discount rate from to  reflecting the general decline in market interest rates during the rate also will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during a further one percentage point reduction in the assumed discount rate for lyondell  equistar  and lcr would increase lyondell s benefit obligation for pensions and postretirement benefits by approximately million  and would reduce lyondell s net income  including the impact on income from equity investments in equistar and lcr  by approximately million 
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
as of december   the assumed rate of increase was for  for through and thereafter 
a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would have no significant effect on either the benefit liability or the net periodic cost  due to limits on lyondell s maximum contribution level under the medical plan 

table of contents the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption 
investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected rate of return on plan assets rate applied to a market related value of plan assets which  for lyondell  is defined as the market value of assets 
the expected rate of return on plan assets rate is a longer term rate  and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate  reflecting long term market expectations  rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 
prior to  lyondell s expected long term rate of return on plan assets of had been based on the average level of earnings that its independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time 
the expectation was based on an asset allocation of us equity securities expected return  non us equity securities expected return  and fixed income securities expected return that had been recommended by the advisor  and had been adopted for the plans 
over the three year period ended december   lyondell s actual return on plan assets was a loss averaging per year 
in  lyondell reviewed its asset allocation and expected long term rate of return assumptions and obtained an updated asset allocation study from the independent pension investment advisor  including updated expectations for long term market earnings rates for various classes of investments 
based on this review  lyondell reduced its expected long term rate of return on plan assets to  and did not significantly change its plan asset allocations 
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets 
management s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 
based on the market value of plan assets at december   a one percentage point decrease in this assumption for lyondell  equistar and lcr would decrease lyondell s net income  including the impact on income from equity investments in equistar and lcr  by approximately million 
net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings  rather than the actual earnings or loss 
as a result of asset earnings significantly below the expected return on plan assets rate over the last several years  the level of unrecognized investment losses  together with the net actuarial gains and losses  is million at december  this unrecognized amount  to the extent it exceeds ten percent of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan  will be recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 
this annual amortization charge will be approximately million per year based on the december  unrecognized amount 
additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accruals for taxes based on income uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of complex us federal and us tax regulations 
management expects that lyondell s interpretations will prevail 
also  lyondell has recognized deferred tax benefits relating to its future utilization of past operating losses 
lyondell believes it is more likely than not that the amounts in excess of the related valuation reserves will be realized 
further details on lyondell s income taxes appear in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting and reporting changes to better reflect the full cost of employee compensation  lyondell adopted the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options  the preferred method as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in the first quarter lyondell is using the prospective transition method  one of three alternatives under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  for a voluntary change to the fair value method 
under the prospective transition method  an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees during and thereafter is charged to earnings over the related vesting periods 
this change resulted in an after tax charge of approximately million for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents effective january   lyondell implemented sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the primary impact of the statement on lyondell was the classification of gains or losses that result from the early extinguishment of debt as an element of income before extraordinary items 
previously  such gains and losses were classified as extraordinary items 
the consolidated statements of income reflect these changes for all periods presented 
lyondell incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  effective december   and requiring more details about pension plan assets  benefit obligations  cash flows  benefit costs and related information 
sfas no 
revised also requires lyondell to disclose pension and postretirement benefit costs in interim period financial statements beginning in lyondell increased its pension disclosure to comply with sfas no 
revised 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the fsp permits a sponsor of a retiree health benefit plan to make a one time election to defer recognition of the effects of the new medicare legislation in accounting for its plans under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  or in making disclosures related to its plans required by sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  until the fasb develops and issues authoritative guidance on accounting for subsidies provided by the act 
such fasb guidance  could require a change in currently reported information see note to the consolidated financial statements 
lyondell elected to make the one time deferral and is currently evaluating the effect of the fsp fas effective january   lyondell adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets  and sfas  accounting for exit or disposal activities  which addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities and facility closings 
lyondell s adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
had no material impact on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  primarily to clarify the required accounting for interests in variable interest entities vies 
this standard replaces fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  that was issued in january to address certain situations in which a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
lyondell s application of fin r has no material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
effective january   lyondell implemented sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon implementation of sfas no 
 lyondell reviewed its goodwill for impairment and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
however  equistar reviewed its goodwill for impairment and concluded that the entire balance was impaired  resulting in a billion charge to equistar s earnings as of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the conclusion was based on a comparison to equistar s indicated fair value  using multiples of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for comparable companies as an indicator of fair value 
lyondell s share of the equistar charge was offset by a corresponding reduction in the excess of lyondell s share of equistar s partners capital over the carrying value of lyondell s investment in equistar 
consequently  there was no net effect of the impairment on lyondell s earnings or investment in equistar 
as a result of implementing sfas no 
 lyondell s pretax income in and subsequent years is favorably affected by million annually because of the elimination of lyondell s goodwill amortization 

table of contents environmental matters various environmental laws and regulations impose substantial requirements upon the operations of lyondell 
lyondell s policy is to be in compliance with such laws and regulations  which include  among others  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or superfund as amended  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and the clean air act amendments 
lyondell does not specifically track all recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution in ongoing operations 
such costs are included in cost of sales 
lyondell  equistar and lcr also make capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations 
such capital expenditures totaled approximately million for and and million for  on a basis for lyondell  equistar and lcr 
the increases in and capital expenditures resulted from new emission reduction rules  discussed in the next paragraph below 
lyondell currently estimates that these rules will result in further increases in expenditures  on a basis  to approximately million in and million in  including preliminary estimated expenditures for engineering studies related to emission control standards for highly reactive  volatile organic compounds hrvoc 
however  lyondell is still completing its assessment of the impact of the proposed hrvoc emission standards 
the eight county houston galveston region has been designated a severe non attainment area for ozone by the us environmental protection agency epa 
emission reduction controls for nitrogen oxides nox must be installed at lcr s refinery and each of lyondell s two facilities and equistar s six facilities in the houston galveston region during the next several years 
revised rules adopted by the regulatory agencies changed the required nox reduction levels from to 
under the revised standard  lyondell estimates that the incremental capital expenditures would range between million and million for lyondell  equistar and lcr  collectively 
the following table summarizes the range of projected capital expenditures for lyondell and its principal joint ventures to comply with the nox emission reduction requirements millions of dollars range of estimates nox capital expenditures basis lyondell equistar lcr total nox capital expenditures nox capital expenditures lyondell proportionate share lyondell equistar lcr total lyondell proportionate share of nox capital expenditures of these amounts  lyondell s proportionate share of spending through december  totaled million 
however  the above estimate could be affected by increased costs for stricter proposed controls over hrvocs 
lyondell  equistar and lcr are still assessing the impact of the proposed hrvoc revisions and there can be no guarantee as to the ultimate capital cost of implementing any final plan developed to ensure ozone attainment by the deadline 
the timing and amount of these expenditures are also subject to regulatory and other uncertainties  as well as obtaining the necessary permits and approvals 
the clean air act amendments of set minimum levels for oxygenates  such as mtbe  in gasoline sold in areas not meeting specified air quality standards 
however  the presence of mtbe in some water supplies in california and other states due to gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks and in surface water from recreational water craft has led to public concern about the use of mtbe 
certain us states have banned the use of mtbe  while other us federal and state governmental initiatives have sought either to rescind the oxygen requirement for reformulated gasoline or to restrict or also ban the use of mtbe 
during  the us house of representatives and the us senate produced an energy bill that would have phased out the use of mtbe over 
table of contents years  but also provided limited liability protection for mtbe 
the house of representatives passed the bill as reported out of conference  but the senate has not 
a new energy bill is under consideration in the senate in that would phase out use of mtbe  but would not provide liability protection 
the final form and timing of the reconciliation of these competing revisions of the energy bill in the us congress is uncertain 
at the state level  a number of states have legislated mtbe bans 
of these  several are mid west states that use ethanol as the oxygenate of choice 
bans in these states should not impact mtbe demand 
however  connecticut  california and new york have bans of mtbe in place effective january  these bans started to negatively affect mtbe demand during late in addition  in several major oil companies substantially reduced or discontinued the use of mtbe in gasoline produced for california markets  negatively affecting demand 
lyondell estimates that  in  california  connecticut and new york combined represented approximately one fourth of us mtbe industry demand 
at this time  lyondell cannot predict the full impact that these potential us federal and state governmental initiatives and state bans will have on mtbe margins or volumes longer term 
lyondell s north american mtbe sales represented approximately of its total revenues 
lyondell intends to continue marketing mtbe in the us in the short term  in response to market conditions  lyondell is capable of adjusting  within design limits  the relative ratios of po and tba produced at its po tba plants 
it can also shift more of its po production to po sm plants from po tba plants  as necessary 
this flexibility has increased with the fourth quarter startup of the maasvlakte po sm plant 
however  should it become necessary or desirable to significantly reduce mtbe production  lyondell would need to make capital expenditures to add the flexibility to produce alternative gasoline blending components  such as iso octane  iso octene or ethyl tertiary butyl ether etbe  at its us based mtbe plant 
under the more expensive iso octane alternative  the current estimated costs for converting lyondell s us based mtbe plant to iso octane production range from million to million 
alternatively  lyondell s us based mtbe plant could be converted to etbe production with minimal capital expenditure 
lyondell is pursuing etbe viability through legislative efforts 
one key hurdle is equal access to the federal subsidy provided for ethanol blended into gasoline for the ethanol component of etbe 
lyondell has not made any capital commitments regarding any of these alternatives at this time  and any ultimate decision will depend upon further regulatory and market developments 
the profit contribution related to alternative gasoline blending components is likely to be lower than that historically realized on mtbe 
see item a 
disclosure of market and regulatory risk regulatory risk 
the clean air act also specified certain emissions standards for vehicles and  in  the epa concluded that additional controls on gasoline and diesel fuel were necessary 
new standards for gasoline were finalized in and will require refiners to produce a low sulfur gasoline by  with final compliance by a new on road diesel standard was adopted in january and will require refiners of on road diesel fuel to produce as ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd by june and by the end of  with less stringent standards for off road diesel fuel 
to date  the off road diesel fuel standards have not been finalized 
these gasoline and diesel fuel standards will result in increased capital investment for lcr 
in  lcr developed alternative approaches to complying with the low sulfur gasoline standard and the new diesel fuel standard that will lead to an approximate million reduction in overall estimated capital expenditures for these projects 
as a result  lcr recognized impairment of value of million of project costs incurred to date 
the revised estimated spending for these projects  excluding the million charge  totaled between million to million 
lcr significantly reduced the estimated costs for implementing the new diesel standards as a result of its ability to retrofit current production units 
the revised estimated cost for the new diesel standards also reflects lcr s implementation strategy for producing ulsd and off road diesel 
lcr has spent approximately million  excluding the million charge  as of december  for both the gasoline and diesel fuel standards projects 
lyondell s share of these incremental capital expenditures for these projects is not expected to exceed million 
in addition  these standards could result in higher operating costs for lcr 
equistar s business may also be impacted if these standards increase the cost for processing fuel components 
as of december   lyondell s environmental liability for future assessment and remediation costs at current and former plant sites and a limited number of superfund sites totaled million 
substantially all amounts accrued are expected to be incurred over the next ten years 
lyondell spent from million to million annually for each of the last three years for environmental remediation matters 
lyondell estimates that expenditures will be 
table of contents approximately million in in the opinion of management  there is currently no material range of loss in excess of the amount recorded for these sites 
however  it is possible that new information about the sites for which the accrual has been established  new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies  could require lyondell to reassess its potential exposure related to environmental matters 
item a 
disclosure of market and regulatory risk commodity price risk a substantial portion of lyondell s products and raw materials  as well as those of equistar and lcr  are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of lyondell s profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
lyondell tries to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
these include entering into multi year processing and sales agreements  moving downstream into derivatives products whose pricing is more stable  utilization of the raw material flexibility of equistar s olefins plants and the use of the deemed margin contract at lcr 
in addition  lyondell and equistar at times enter into commodity derivative hedging transactions  primarily price swaps and call options  to help manage their exposure to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of natural gas and crude oil related raw materials as well as product sales 
market risks created by these derivative instruments and the mark to market valuations of open positions are monitored using value at risk 
during  and  the derivative transactions were not significant compared to lyondell s and equistar s overall inventory purchases and product sales 
at december   the market value of outstanding derivatives and the related value at risk was not material 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange exposures result from cash flows between lyondell s us and non us operations and transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a non us operating entity 
lyondell s non us operations account for approximately of consolidated revenues and of consolidated assets 
at december   there were no foreign currency forward contracts or other foreign currency related derivative contracts outstanding 
interest rate risk lyondell was exposed to interest rate risk with respect to variable rate debt 
during  lyondell repaid the remaining variable rate debt that was outstanding at december   using proceeds of new fixed rate debt offerings 
lyondell had no borrowing outstanding under its variable rate revolving credit facility at december   and its remaining exposure to interest rate risk was minimal 
during  equistar repaid its remaining variable rate debt that was outstanding at december   using proceeds of new fixed rate debt offerings 
equistar had no borrowing outstanding under its inventory based revolving credit facility at december   and its remaining exposure to interest rate risk was minimal 
at december   lcr had variable rate debt of million  excluding the note payable by lcr to lyondell 
lyondell s exposure to interest rate risk at lcr was not material
