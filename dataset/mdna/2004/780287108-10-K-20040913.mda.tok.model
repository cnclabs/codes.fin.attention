item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview royal gold  inc  together with its subsidiaries  is engaged in the business of acquiring and managing precious metals royalties 
we seek to acquire existing royalties or to finance projects that are in production or near production in exchange for royalty interests 
royalties are passive non operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue from the project after deducting specified costs  if any 
we also explore and develop properties thought to contain precious metals and seek to obtain royalty interests and other carried ownership interests in these properties through the subsequent transfer of interests to other mining companies 
we expect that substantially all of our revenues are and will be derived from royalty interests 
we do not conduct mining operations at this time 
during the fiscal year  we focused on the management of our existing royalty interests  the acquisition of royalty interests  and the creation of royalty interests through exploration 
our financial results are closely tied to the price of gold 
during the fiscal year  the price of gold averaged per ounce compared with an average price of per ounce for the fiscal year 
as a result of the increased gold price  our gsr sliding scale royalty at the pipeline mining complex was calculated at an average rate of compared with an average rate of during the prior year 
this increase in our average sliding scale royalty rate contributed to increased revenues of  during the fiscal year  compared with revenues of  during the fiscal year 
our principal mineral property interests are two sliding scale gross smelter return  or gsr  royalty interests  one fixed gsr royalty interest  and one net value royalty interest  all relating to a mining complex known as the pipeline mining complex  which includes the pipeline and south pipeline gold deposits  operated by the cortez joint venture  which is a joint venture between placer cortez  inc  a subsidiary of placer dome  inc  and kennecott explorations australia ltd 
 a subsidiary of rio tinto  one net smelter return nsr royalty on the majority of the leeville project  which includes the development stage leeville underground mine and a portion of the carlin east mine  operated by newmont mining corporation  and one nsr royalty on the sj claims  which covers a portion of the betze post open pit mine  at the goldstrike operation operated by barrick gold corporation 
our other producing royalty interests include a to nsr sliding scale royalty interest covering a portion of the bald mountain mine  operated by placer dome us inc the sliding scale royalty increases or decreases with the gold price  adjusted by the producer price index 
our royalty rate would increase to around a gold price of per ounce 
we also own a nsr royalty on a number of properties in santa cruz province  argentina  including the martha silver mine  which is operated by coeur d alene mines corporation 
estimates received from the mine operators indicate that gold production  attributable to our royalty interests  for calendar year is expected to be approximately  ounces from the pipeline 
table of contents mining complex   ounces from the carlin east mine at the leeville project   ounces from the sj claims and  ounces from the bald mountain mine 
the martha silver mine is expected to produce million ounces of silver attributable to our royalty interest for the calendar year 
during the first six months of calendar  the mine operators have reported production attributable to our royalty interests of  ounces from the pipeline mining complex   ounces from the carlin east mine located at the leeville project   ounces from the sj claims and  ounces from the bald mountain mine 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our most critical accounting estimates relate to our assumptions regarding future gold prices and the estimates of reserves and recoveries of mine operators 
we rely on reserve estimates reported by the operators on the properties in which we have royalty interests 
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the potential impairments of long lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which we charge depreciation and amortization to earnings 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates and assumptions  however  actual amounts could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the reserves reported by the operators as of december   were based on a gold price of per ounce 
we based our deferred tax asset valuation on a per ounce gold price  as of june  if the long term gold price is substantially lower  these estimates would need to change and could result in material adverse write offs of assets and the need to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had current assets of  compared to current liabilities of  for a current ratio of to this compares to current assets of  and current liabilities of  at june   resulting in a current ratio of to the increase in our current ratio between periods resulted primarily from net cash provided by operating activities of  we continue to have no long term debt 
during fiscal  liquidity needs were met from  in royalty revenues   from stock option exercises  our available cash resources  and interest and other income of  we have a million line of credit from hsbc bank usa that may be used to acquire producing royalties 
repayment of any loan under the line of credit will be secured by a mortgage on our gsr royalty at the pipeline mining complex  and by a security interest in the proceeds from any of our royalties at the pipeline mining complex 
any assets purchased with the line of credit will also serve as collateral 
no funds have been drawn under the line of credit 
we currently anticipate that current financial resources and funds generated from operations will be adequate to cover anticipated expenditures for general and administrative expenses  exploration and business development costs  and capital expenditures for fiscal and beyond 
our current financial resources are available for royalty acquisition and to fund dividends 
in the event of a substantial 
table of contents acquisition  we could seek additional debt or equity financing 
we may also seek additional funding from time to time as management deems appropriate 
our contractual obligations as of june  follow payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases rg russia long term retirement obligation total for information on our contractual obligations  see note to the consolidated financial statements under part ii
