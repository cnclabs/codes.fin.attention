item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general in this report  unless the context requires otherwise  references to we  us  our  or the company are intended to mean kinder morgan  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
specifically  as discussed in notes  and of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we have engaged in acquisitions including the october acquisition of kinder morgan delaware  inc  the indirect owner of the general partner interest in kinder morgan energy partners  lp  a publicly traded master limited partnership  referred to in this report as kinder morgan energy partners  and divestitures including the discontinuance of certain lines of business and the transfer of certain assets to kinder morgan energy partners that may affect comparisons of financial position and results of operations between periods 
we are a provider of energy and related services through our direct ownership and operation of energy related assets  and through our ownership interests in and operation of kinder morgan energy partners  a publicly traded master limited partnership 
our energy related assets owned and operated directly which  during  are budgeted to contribute approximately of the total of our segment earnings plus earnings attributable to our investment in kinder morgan energy partners include natural gas pipelines  natural gas storage facilities  retail natural gas distribution facilities and a relatively small investment in natural gas fired power generation facilities 
our investment in kinder morgan energy partners  which  during  is budgeted to contribute approximately of the total of our segment earnings plus earnings attributable to our investment in kinder morgan energy partners includes ownership of the general partner interest  as well as ownership of limited partner units and shares of kinder morgan management  llc 
as described under business strategy elsewhere in this report  our strategy and focus continues to be on ownership of fee based energy related assets which are core to the energy infrastructure of the country and serve growing markets 
these assets tend to have relatively stable cash flows while presenting us with opportunities to expand our facilities to serve additional customers and nearby markets 
we evaluate the performance of our investment in these assets using  among other measures  segment earnings and return on investment 
we will define these measures and then present them by segment in the analysis of our results of operations that follows 
the variability of our operating results is attributable to a number of factors including i national and local markets for energy and related services  including the effects of competition  ii the impact of regulatory proceedings  iii the effect of weather on customer energy and related services usage  as well as our operation and construction activities  iv increases or decreases in interest rates  v the degree of our success in controlling costs and identifying and carrying out profitable expansion projects and vi changes in taxation policy or rates 
certain of these factors are beyond our direct control  but we operate a structured risk management program to mitigate certain of the risks associated with changes in the price of natural gas  interest rates and weather relative to historical norms 
the remaining risks are primarily mitigated through our strategic and operational planning and monitoring processes 
see risk factors elsewhere in this report 
after the divestitures discussed above  our remaining businesses apart from our investment in kinder morgan energy partners constitute four business segments 
our largest business segment and our primary source of operating income is natural gas pipeline company of america  which owns and operates a major interstate natural gas pipeline system that runs from natural gas producing areas in west texas and the gulf of mexico to its principal market area of chicago  illinois 
in accordance with our strategy to increase operational focus on core assets  we have worked toward renewing existing agreements and entering into new agreements to fully utilize the transportation and storage capacity of natural gas pipeline company of america s system 
as a result  natural gas pipeline company of america sold virtually all of its capacity through the winter season 
natural gas pipeline company of america continues to pursue opportunities to connect its system to power generation facilities and  in addition  has extended its system to east st 
louis  illinois 
our other business segments consist of i our transcolorado system  a mile natural gas pipeline and related facilities extending from approximately miles southwest of meeker  colorado to bloomfield  new mexico  ii our retail distribution of natural gas to approximately  customers in colorado  wyoming and nebraska and iii our investment in  in some cases  operation of  and in previous periods construction of electric power generation facilities 
the transcolorado system receives gas from two coal seam natural gas treating plants located in the san juan basin of colorado and from pipeline and gathering system interconnections within the paradox and piceance basins of western colorado 
we purchased the remaining percent interest in transcolorado that we did not already own from questar corp 
in the fourth quarter of and have announced plans to expand the system see transcolorado following and note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
our retail natural gas distribution operations are located  in part  in areas where significant growth is occurring and we expect to participate in that growth through increased natural gas demand 
our power segment owns interests in and  in some cases  operates power generation facilities and continues to hold preferred investments in two gas fired power plants constructed by us and placed into operation in during the fourth quarter of  we announced that we were discontinuing our power development activities and we revalued certain of our power assets 
we also revalued certain of our power assets during the fourth quarter of see power following and note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and contained within this report 
certain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable  unbilled revenues for our natural gas distribution deliveries for which meters have not yet been read  exposures under contractual indemnifications and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
certain of these accounting estimates are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others 
in our retail natural gas distribution business  because we read customer meters on a cycle basis  we are required to estimate the amount of revenue earned as of the end of each period for which service has been rendered but meters have not yet been read 
we have available historical information for these meters and  together with weather related data that is indicative of natural gas demand  we are able to make reasonable estimates 
in our natural gas pipeline businesses  we are similarly required to make estimates for services rendered but for which actual metered volumes are not available at reporting dates 
as with our retail natural gas distribution business  we have historical data available to assist us in the estimation process  but the variations in volume are greater  introducing a larger possibility of error 
we believe our estimates  which are corrected to reflect actual metered volumes in the next accounting month  provide acceptable approximations of the actual revenue earned during any period  especially given that the majority of our revenues in the pipeline business are derived from demand charges  which do not vary with the actual amount of gas transported 
with respect to the amount of income or expense we recognize in association with our retiree medical plans  we must make a number of assumptions with respect to both future financial conditions for example  medical costs  returns on fund assets and market interest rates as well as future actions by plan participants for example  when they will retire and how long they will live after retirement 
most of these assumptions have relatively minor impacts on the overall accounting recognition given to these plans  but two assumptions in particular  the discount rate and the assumed long term rate of return on fund assets  can have significant effects on the amount of expense recorded and liability recognized 
the selection of these assumptions is discussed in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
while we believe our choices for these assumptions are appropriate in the circumstances  other assumptions could also be reasonably applied and  therefore  we note that  at our current level of retiree medical funding  i a change of in the long term return assumption would increase decrease our annual retiree medical expense by approximately   in comparison to that recorded in and ii a change in the discount rate would increase decrease our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by   compared to those balances as of december  with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
these estimates are affected by the choice of remediation methods as well as the expected timing and length of the effort 
often  as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses  additional information is obtained  requiring revisions to estimated costs 
these revisions are reflected in our income in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
we are subject to litigation as the result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance  any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached 
in addition  we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed 
therefore  we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate 
changes in our effective rate  including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes  are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 
as discussed under risk management in item a of this report  we enter into derivative contracts natural gas futures  swaps and options solely for the purpose of mitigating risks that accompany our normal business activities  including interest rates and the price of natural gas and associated transportation 
we account for these derivative transactions as hedges in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidelines  marking the derivatives to market at each reporting date  with the unrealized gains and losses either recognized as part of comprehensive income or  in the case of interest rate swaps  as a valuation adjustment to the underlying debt 
any inefficiency in the performance of the hedge is recognized in income currently and  ultimately  the financial results of the hedge are recognized concurrently with the financial results of the underlying hedged item 
all but an insignificant amount of our natural gas related derivatives are for terms of months or less  allowing us to utilize widely available  published forward pricing curves in determining all of our appropriate market values 
our interest rate swaps are similar in nature to many other such financial instruments and are valued for us by commercial banks with expertise in such valuations

these positive impacts were partially offset by decreased segment earnings from our power business segment 
below the operating income line  net other income and expenses increased from income of million in to income of million in  an increase of million 
this increase reflected i increased equity in earnings of kinder morgan energy partners in due principally to the improved performance from the assets held by kinder morgan energy partners and ii decreased interest expense resulting principally from our lower debt balances 
these positive impacts were partially offset by i an increase of million in minority interest expense attributable to the minority interests in kinder morgan management  llc and ii a million decrease in net gains from asset sales in see note q of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements

as discussed below 
these negative impacts were partially offset by i increased earnings from our natural gas pipeline company of america  transcolorado and kinder morgan retail business segments and ii the fact that results included a million loss resulting from nonperformance by a derivative counterparty enron corp 
see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
below the operating income line  net other income and expenses increased from income of million in to income of million in  an increase of million 
this increase reflected i increased equity in earnings of kinder morgan energy partners in due  in part  to the improved performance from the assets held by kinder morgan energy partners and the cessation of amortization of equity method goodwill related to this investment due to the adoption of sfas no 
see note o of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  ii increased equity in earnings of other equity investments in which are principally included in business segment earnings  iii decreased interest expense reflecting lower interest rates and borrowed balances and iv the inclusion  in results  of million in expense related to the early extinguishment of debt see note b of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements

this management process includes dividing the company into business segments so that performance can be effectively monitored and reported for a limited number of discrete businesses 
currently  we manage and report our operations in four business segments 
in addition  we derive a substantial portion of earnings from our investment in kinder morgan energy partners  which is discussed under earnings from investment in kinder morgan energy partners following 
business segment business conducted referred to as natural gas pipeline company of america and certain affiliates the ownership and operation of a major interstate natural gas pipeline and storage system natural gas pipeline company of america transcolorado gas transmission company the ownership and operation of an interstate natural gas pipeline system in colorado and new mexico transcolorado retail natural gas distribution the regulated sale and transportation of natural gas to residential  commercial and industrial customers including a small distribution system in hermosillo  mexico and the sales of natural gas to certain utility customers under the choice gas program kinder morgan retail power generation the operation and  in previous periods  construction of natural gas fired electric generation facilities power in the fourth quarter of  as further discussed under power following  we decided to discontinue the development portion of our power generation business and decreased the carrying value of certain of our power assets 
an additional reduction in the carrying value of certain power assets was made in the fourth quarter of transcolorado gas transmission company was a joint venture with questar corp 
until we became sole owner by purchasing questar corp 
s interest effective october  results of operations for this segment include our share of transcolorado s earnings recognized under the equity method of accounting prior to october and consolidated results at the level thereafter 
the accounting policies we apply in the generation of business segment earnings are generally the same as those described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  except that i certain items below the operating income line are either not allocated to business segments or are not considered by management in its evaluation of business segment performance and ii equity in earnings of equity method investees  other than kinder morgan energy partners and certain insignificant international investees  are included 
these equity method earnings are included in other income and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  i certain items included in operating income such as general and administrative expenses are not allocated to individual business segments and ii gains and losses from incidental sales of assets are included in segment earnings 
we account for intersegment sales at market prices  while we account for asset transfers at either market value or  in some instances  book value 
following are operating results by individual business segment before intersegment eliminations  including explanations of significant variances between the periods presented 
as necessary for comparative purposes  we have reclassified prior period results and balances to conform to the current presentation 
natural gas pipeline company of america year ended december  in thousands except systems throughput operating revenues gas purchases and other costs of sales segment earnings systems throughput trillion btus natural gas pipeline company of america s segment earnings increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in operating revenues  which was largely offset by a corresponding increase in cost of sales  was due to increased revenues from operational natural gas sales and increased transportation and storage revenues  largely due to expansions extensions of pipeline and storage facilities 
segment earnings for were positively impacted  relative to  by i increased margin from transportation and storage services  including operational natural gas sales  primarily resulting from expansion and extension projects coming on line since the end of the second quarter of last year as discussed below and ii increased margin associated with a regulatory matter that was recently concluded 
these positive impacts were partially offset by i increased depreciation expense related to the expansion and extension projects and ii increased ad valorem taxes 
natural gas pipeline company of america s segment results for do not include a reduction of million in interest expense attributable to the final settlement of a regulatory matter  which amount is included in interest expense  net as discussed elsewhere herein 
system throughput increased by trillion btus from to due  in part  to colder than normal weather in this segment s principal market areas  partially offset by lower volumes on the short haul louisiana line caused by reduced eastern market demand off this part of the system 
the increase in system throughput in did not have a significant direct impact on revenues due to the fact that transportation revenues are derived primarily from demand contracts in which shippers pay a fee to reserve a set amount of system capacity for their use 
horizon pipeline company  which provides natural gas transportation capacity to the growing northern illinois market  began service in the second quarter of horizon pipeline company is a joint venture with nicor inc natural gas pipeline company of america s lateral extension into the eastern portion of the st 
louis metropolitan area began service in the third quarter of during april  natural gas pipeline company of america began construction of bcf of storage service expansion at its existing north lansing storage facility in east texas  all of which is fully subscribed under long term contracts 
although construction on this approximately million project is not expected to be completed until may  the service is available at this time 
natural gas pipeline company of america s segment earnings increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in operating revenues  which was largely offset by a corresponding increase in cost of sales  was due to increased revenues from operational natural gas sales and increased transportation and storage revenues  largely due to expansions extensions of pipeline systems coming on line in segment earnings for were positively affected  relative to  by i increased margins from natural gas transportation and storage services  including operational natural gas sales and ii the inclusion of earnings from our equity investment in horizon pipeline company  which was placed into service during the second quarter of these positive impacts were partially offset by i increased operations and maintenance expenses attributable to transmission mains and underground storage facilities  ii increased depreciation expense due to the addition of new facilities  principally the extension of our system into the eastern portion of the st 
louis metropolitan area  iii increased ad valorem taxes and iv the fact that results include million of pre tax gains from incidental asset sales 
although systems throughput increased in  this increase did not have a significant direct impact on revenues or segment earnings due to the demand component of transportation contracts  as discussed previously 
substantially all of natural gas pipeline company of america s pipeline capacity is committed under firm transportation contracts ranging from one to five years 
under these contracts  over of the revenues are derived from a demand charge and  therefore  are collected regardless of the volume of gas actually transported 
the principal impact of the actual level of gas transported is on fuel recoveries  which are received in kind as volumes move on the system 
approximately of the total transportation volume committed under natural gas pipeline company of america s long term firm transportation contracts in effect on january  had remaining terms of less than three years 
contracts representing approximately of natural gas pipeline company of america s total long term contracted firm transport capacity as of january  are scheduled to expire during natural gas pipeline company of america continues to actively pursue the renegotiation  extension and or replacement of expiring contracts 
nicor gas and peoples energy  two local gas distribution companies in the chicago  illinois area  are natural gas pipeline company of america s two largest customers 
for  we currently expect that natural gas pipeline company of america will experience growth in segment earnings in comparison to this increase in earnings is expected to be derived primarily from i the impact of having a full year of earnings from the north lansing storage expansion project  and ii transportation revenue increases resulting from higher rates being contracted for on base transport business 
however  as discussed following  there are factors beyond our control that can affect our results  including developments in the regulatory arena and as yet unforeseen competitive developments 
accordingly  our actual future results may differ significantly from our projections 
our principal exposure to market variability is related to the variation in natural gas prices and basis differentials  which can affect gross margins in our natural gas pipeline company of america segment 
basis differential is a term that refers to the difference in natural gas prices between two locations or two points in time 
these price differences can be affected by  among other things  natural gas supply and demand  available transportation capacity  storage inventories and deliverability  prices of alternative fuels and weather conditions 
in recent periods  additional competitive pressures have been generated in midwest natural gas markets due to the introduction and planned introduction of pipeline capacity to bring additional supplies of natural gas into the chicago market area  although incremental pipeline capacity to take gas out of the area has also been constructed 
we have attempted to reduce our exposure to this form of market variability by pursuing long term  fixed rate type contract agreements to utilize the capacity on natural gas pipeline company of america s system 
in addition  as discussed under risk management in item a of this report and in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we utilize a comprehensive risk management program to mitigate our exposure to changes in the market price of natural gas and associated transportation 
the majority of natural gas pipeline company of america s system is subject to rate regulation under the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission 
currently  there are no material proceedings challenging the rates on any of our pipeline systems 
nonetheless  shippers on our pipelines do have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations 
there can be no assurance that we will not face future challenges to the rates we receive for services on our pipeline systems 
transcolorado year ended december  in thousands except systems throughput operating revenues gas purchases and other costs of sales segment earnings losses systems throughput trillion btus transcolorado was a joint venture with questar corp 
until we bought questar s interest effective october   thus becoming the sole owner 
as a result  transcolorado s results shown above reflect our equity interest in its earnings prior to october  and of its results on a consolidated basis thereafter 
transcolorado s segment earnings increased from million in to million in results for  relative to  reflected  in addition to a full year at the increased level of ownership  the favorable impact of wide basis differentials on certain transportation contracts 
these basis differentials have narrowed since mid as a result of its contracting activities as discussed below  the contractual volume of activity that is suject to changes in basis differentials has decreased 
the significant improvement in transcolorado s operating results from to  apart from the change in our ownership percentage  resulted from the increased demand and associated increased throughput on the system 
this increased demand has resulted from the incremental natural gas production available in the rocky mountain basins that form the principal supply area for transcolorado and the limited pathways for this natural gas to get to markets both east and west of these production areas 
due in large part to this increased demand  transcolorado has sold out its available firm capacity through october on september   we announced that we had signed a year  firm natural gas transportation contract with an undisclosed shipper that will allow us to construct facilities that will result in a  dekatherm per day expansion of capacity on the transcolorado system 
the facilities consist of three new compressor stations and modifications at two existing compressor stations  which will increase compression by more than  horsepower 
on october   we filed with the ferc for authority to construct the facilities and place them into service 
subject to appropriate regulatory approvals  we expect to place the facilities into service during the third quarter of the transcolorado open season for various supply laterals  mainline capacity expansion and mainline extension proposals ended april  post open season negotiations successfully led to the filing discussed above of the mainline capacity expansion application with the ferc 
negotiations with prospective shippers regarding the proposed mainline extension were primarily linked to downstream capacity negotiations on kinder morgan energy partners proposed silver canyon pipeline project 
accordingly  kinder morgan energy partners is now negotiating with prospective shippers on the proposed silver canyon pipeline to include previously identified transcolorado mainline extension facilities as part of the silver canyon pipeline project 
for  we currently expect that transcolorado will experience growth in segment earnings in comparison to this earnings increase is expected to be driven by incremental revenues from the expansion and contract renewals at higher transport rates 
however  certain market factors are largely beyond our control and  as discussed following  transcolorado is subject to federal regulation 
for these and other reasons  its actual future results may differ significantly from our projections 
in addition  we and kinder morgan energy partners have announced that we are considering the transfer of transcolorado to kinder morgan energy partners  subject to various factors  including obtaining fairness opinions with respect to any such transaction for both us and kinder morgan energy partners 
the majority of transcolorado s system is subject to rate regulation under the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission 
currently  there are no material proceedings challenging the rates on any of our pipeline systems 
nonetheless  shippers on our pipelines do have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations 
there can be no assurance that we will not face challenges to the rates we receive for services on our pipeline systems in the future 
transcolorado is also subject to market variability in natural gas prices and basis differentials 
please refer to the discussion of basis differentials under the heading natural gas pipeline company of america in this item 
kinder morgan retail year ended december  in thousands except systems throughput operating revenues gas purchases and other costs of sales segment earnings systems throughput trillion btus kinder morgan retail s segment earnings increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
the decrease in operating revenues in  relative to  principally resulted from a full year of our choice gas program in certain of our service territories 
the choice gas program allows competing commodity natural gas providers to sell natural gas to customers connected to our natural gas distribution system  which decreases our revenues from natural gas sales accompanied by a corresponding decrease in gas purchase costs  although we continue to receive the same margin for transporting the gas 
the increase in throughput volumes in was the result of i increased demand for natural gas used in space heating as a result of colder weather and ii continued customer growth  partially offset by lower irrigation season demand 
segment earnings were positively impacted in  relative to  by i increased margins resulting from a full year of our choice gas commodity program in certain of our service territories  ii continued customer growth in existing service territories  particularly colorado  and iii reduced operations and maintenance expenses 
these positive impacts were partially offset by i reduced demand during irrigation season  ii increased depreciation expense resulting from asset additions and iii the inclusion in results of a million ad valorem tax refund from an affiliated shipper 
our weather hedging program continued to contribute to stability in kinder morgan retail s earnings pattern by reducing the impact of weather related demand fluctuations see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
kinder morgan retail s segment earnings increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
the decrease in operating revenues in  relative to  was principally due to lower natural gas prices in and was offset by lower costs for natural gas purchases 
segment earnings were positively impacted in  relative to  by i margins derived from the fourth quarter acquisition of natural gas distribution facilities from citizens communications company  as described following  ii strong demand during the irrigation season  iii the addition of new customers in existing service territories and iv a million ad valorem tax refund in from an affiliated shipper 
these positive impacts were partially offset by higher operations  maintenance and depreciation expenses in principally attributable to the newly acquired facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  kinder morgan retail successfully completed the acquisition of natural gas distribution facilities from citizens communications company for approximately million in cash and assumed liabilities 
the natural gas distribution assets serve approximately  residential  commercial and agricultural customers in bent  crowley  otero  archuleta  la plata and mineral counties in colorado 
for  we currently expect that kinder morgan retail will experience approximately growth in segment earnings 
with a stable base of earnings due to regulated business  supplemented by a weather hedging program  increased earnings are expected to derive largely from the addition of new customers in existing service territories  especially certain high growth areas in colorado 
however  as discussed following  there are factors beyond our control that can affect our results  including developments in the regulatory arena  currently unforeseen competitive developments and weather related impacts outside our hedging program 
for these and other reasons  our actual future results may differ significantly from our projections 
a significant portion of kinder morgan retail s business is subject to rate regulation by each respective state s utility commission in colorado  wyoming and nebraska 
there are currently no material proceedings challenging the base rates on any of our intrastate pipeline or distribution systems 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that we will not face future challenges to the rates we receive for these services 
kinder morgan retail is also subject to market variability in natural gas prices and basis differentials 
please refer to the discussion of basis differentials under the heading natural gas pipeline company of america in this item 
power year ended december  in thousands operating revenues gas purchases and other costs of sales segment earnings excludes charges of million and million in and  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of certain assets  and a loss of million in resulting from the sale of natural gas reserves by an equity method investee 
these charges are discussed below 
beginning with  results for this segment include only the results of our power business 
segment revenues and segment earnings  as reported above  decreased by million and million  respectively  from to these decreases were expected  and principally resulted from reduced development fees due to the completed construction of the jackson  michigan and wrightsville  arkansas power plants  as well as our decision to exit the power development business 
this decision is discussed below  as well as the reductions we recorded during and in the carrying value of certain of our power investments 
excluding the operating results of the wattenberg facilities that were sold in as discussed below  segment revenues  and segment earnings decreased by million and million  respectively  from to power s reduced earnings reflected lower power plant development fees 
the reduction in development fees was partially offset by i increased fees received for operating power plants and ii decreased amortization charges as a result of newly adopted rules regarding amortization of goodwill see note o of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating results of this segment for included million of revenue and million of segment earnings resulting from our operating agreement with kerr mcgee gathering llc formerly hs resources  inc  which agreement concluded upon the sale of our wattenberg natural gas facilities to kerr mcgee effective december  in february  kinder morgan power announced an agreement under which williams energy marketing and trading agreed to supply natural gas to and market capacity for years for a megawatt natural gas fired orion technology electric power plant in jackson  michigan 
effective july   construction of this facility was completed and commercial operations commenced 
concurrently with commencement of commercial operations  i kinder morgan power made a preferred investment in triton power company llc valued at approximately million  and  ii triton power company llc  through its wholly owned subsidiary  triton power michigan llc  entered into a year lease of the jackson power facility from the plant owner  alphagen power  llc 
williams energy marketing and trading supplies all natural gas to and purchases all power from the power plant under a year tolling agreement with triton power michigan llc 
our preferred equity interest has no management or voting rights  but does retain certain protective rights  and is entitled to a cumulative return  compounded monthly  of per annum 
no income is expected in from this preferred investment 
due to a recent change in accounting standards  effective december   we began consolidating triton power company  llc see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
in may  kinder morgan power and mirant corporation formerly southern energy inc announced plans to build a megawatt natural gas fired electric power plant in wrightsville  arkansas  utilizing kinder morgan power s orion technology 
construction of this facility was completed on july  and commercial operations commenced 
mirant corporation operates and maintains the wrightsville facility and manages the natural gas supply and electricity sales for the project company that owns the power plant 
kinder morgan power made an investment in the project company  comprised primarily of preferred stock 
this facility has not been dispatched significantly since july  during the third quarter of  we announced that mirant had placed the wrightsville  arkansas plant in bankruptcy in october  and we would assess the long term prospects for this facility during the fourth quarter 
in december  we completed our analysis and determined that it was no longer appropriate to assign any carrying value to our investment in this facility and recorded a million pre tax charge  effectively writing off our remaining investment in the wrightsville power facility 
during  we noted that a number of factors had negatively affected power s business environment and certain of its current operations 
these factors  which are currently expected to continue in the near to intermediate term  include i volatile and generally declining prices for wholesale electric power in certain markets  ii cancellation and or postponement of the construction of a number of new power generation facilities  iii difficulty in obtaining air permits with acceptable operating conditions and constraints and iv a marked deterioration in the financial condition of a number of participants in the power generating and marketing business  including participants in the power plants in jackson  michigan and wrightsville  arkansas 
during the fourth quarter of  after completing an analysis of these and other factors to determine their impact on the market value of these assets and the prospects for this business in the future  we i determined that we would no longer pursue power development activities and ii recorded a million pre tax charge to reduce the carrying value of our investments in i sites for future power plant development  ii power plants and iii turbines and associated equipment 
pursuant to a right we obtained in conjunction with the acquisition of the thermo companies  in december  we made an additional investment in our colorado power businesses in the form of approximately million kinder morgan management shares that we owned 
we delivered these shares to an entity controlled by the former thermo owners  which entity is required to retain the shares until they vest  shares will vest each january of  and  with the remainder vesting on january  
we will continue to receive distributions made by kinder morgan management attributable to the unvested shares 
we recorded our increased investment based on the third party determined million fair value of the shares as of the contribution date  with a corresponding liability representing our obligation to deliver vested shares in the future 
the effect of this incremental investment will be to increase our ownership interest in the thermo entities beginning in we expect that segment earnings from power will decline by approximately due to discontinuing power plant development 
actual future results may differ significantly from our projections

this increase was principally due to i increased equity in the earnings of kinder morgan energy partners due  in part  to the strong performance from the assets held by kinder morgan energy partners and ii decreased interest expense  reflecting reduced interest rates and reduced debt outstanding

income taxes continuing operations the income tax provision increased from million in to million in  an increase of million due mainly to an increase of million in income from continuing operations before income taxes 
in addition  the income tax provision for was lower due to the combined impacts of i a decrease of approximately million due to the impact of the lower effective tax rate on previously recorded deferred tax liabilities  ii a decrease of approximately million due to the resolution of certain issues with respect to prior year tax returns at amounts less than those previously accrued and iii a decrease of approximately million due to the impact of a dividends received deduction 
the income tax provision increased from million in to million in  a decrease of million despite an increase of million in income from continuing operations before income taxes 
the income tax provision for was reduced by the combined impacts of i a decrease in the effective tax rate on current year income from approximately in to approximately in  principally due to a decrease in the provision for state income taxes and ii decreases in the tax provision as mentioned above 
discontinued operations during  we adopted and implemented plans to discontinue the following lines of business i gathering and processing of natural gas  including short haul intrastate pipelines and providing field services to natural gas producers  ii wholesale marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids  iii international operations and iv the direct marketing of non energy products and services 
during  we completed the disposition of these businesses  with the exception of international operations principally consisting of a natural gas distribution system in hermosillo  mexico which  in the fourth quarter of  we decided to retain 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an incremental loss of approximately million net of tax benefit of million to adjust previously recorded liabilities to reflect current estimates of our remaining obligations 
we had a remaining liability of approximately million at december  associated with these discontinued operations  due to an indemnification obligation 
we do not expect significant additional financial impacts associated with these matters 
note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contains certain additional financial information with respect to these discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources primary cash requirements our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating  general and administrative expenses  are for debt service  capital expenditures  common stock repurchases and quarterly cash dividends to our common shareholders 
our capital expenditures other than sustaining capital expenditures  our common stock repurchases and our quarterly cash dividends to our common shareholders are discretionary 
we expect to fund these expenditures with existing cash and cash flows from operating activities 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from operations  we could meet these cash requirements through borrowings under our credit facilities  issuing short term commercial paper  long term notes or additional shares of common stock 
invested capital the following table illustrates the sources of our invested capital 
our ratio of total debt to total capital has declined significantly since  and even more significantly in comparison to earlier periods 
this decline has resulted from a number of factors  including our increased cash flows from operations as discussed under cash flows following 
in recent periods  we have significantly increased our dividends per share and have announced our intention to consider further increases on an annual basis  and we maintain an ongoing program to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
for these reasons  among others  any declines in our ratio of total debt to total capital in the future may be smaller 
in addition to the direct sources of debt and equity financing shown in the following table  we obtain financing indirectly through our ownership interests in unconsolidated entities as shown under significant financing transactions following 
our largest such unconsolidated investment is in kinder morgan energy partners 
see investment in kinder morgan energy partners following

after inclusion of applicable letters of credit  the remaining available borrowing capacity under the bank facilities was million and million at december  and february   respectively 
the bank facilities include covenants that are common in such arrangements 
for example  both facilities require consolidated debt to be less than of consolidated capitalization 
in addition  both of the bank facilities require the debt of consolidated subsidiaries to be less than of our consolidated debt and require the consolidated debt of each material subsidiary to be less than of our consolidated total capitalization 
also  both credit agreements require that our consolidated net worth inclusive of trust preferred securities be at least billion plus percent of consolidated net income earned for each fiscal quarter beginning with the third quarter of our current maturities of long term debt of million at december  consisted of current maturities of our million of series debentures due september  apart from our notes payable and current maturities of long term debt  our current liabilities  net of our current assets  represents an additional short term obligation of approximately million at december  given our expected cash flows from operations and our unused debt capacity as discussed preceding  including our three year revolving credit facility  and based on our projected cash needs in the near term  we do not expect any liquidity issues to arise

all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
net cash flows from operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
this positive variance is principally due to i a million increase in cash distributions received in attributable to our interests in kinder morgan energy partners see the discussion following  ii million of cash proceeds received in from termination of an interest rate swap  iii an increase of million in cash inflows from gas in underground storage during significant year to year variations in cash used or generated from gas in storage transactions are due to changes in injection and withdrawal volumes as well as fluctuations in natural gas prices  iv a million decrease in cash outflows during for pension contributions in excess of expense and v the fact that cash flows in included million of cash outflows for a litigation settlement 
these positive impacts were partially offset by an increase of million in cash outflows for deferred purchased gas costs

this positive variance principally reflects a million increase in cash distributions received in attributable to our interest in kinder morgan energy partners and a decrease of million in cash outflows for gas in underground storage during these positive impacts were partially offset by several non recurring cash payments and cash flow timing issues including i a second quarter million payment and escrow deposit in settlement of certain litigation involving jack j

summarized financial information for kinder morgan energy partners is contained in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash flows from investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million 
this decreased use of cash is principally due to the fact that included i a million investment in i units of kinder morgan energy partners  ii a million cash outflow for investments in power plant facilities  iii payment of million net of cash acquired for the acquisition of the remaining interest in the transcolorado system  iv million in capital expenditures for the natural gas pipeline company of america pipeline extension to east st 
louis  illinois  v million for acquisition of the sayre natural gas storage facility and vi a million investment in horizon pipeline company 
net cash flows used in investing activities decreased from  million in to million in  a decrease of million 
this decreased use of cash is principally due to the fact that included a billion cash outflow versus a million cash outflow during for investments in kinder morgan energy partners  principally for the purchase of i units 
this favorable variance was partially offset by i an increase of million in for investments in power plants  ii an increase of million in capital expenditures in  principally for the natural gas pipeline company of america pipeline extension to east st 
louis  illinois  iii a million cash outflow for an investment in horizon pipeline company and iv the fact that included million of proceeds from discontinued operations sold during incremental investment in the transcolorado system totaled million in as we retired our share of its debt and million net of cash acquired in as we acquired an incremental interest 
total proceeds received in from asset sales were million  of which million represented proceeds from the sale to oneok of our gathering and processing businesses in oklahoma  kansas and west texas as well as our marketing and trading business 
net cash flows from financing activities net cash flows used in provided by financing activities decreased from a source of million in to a use of million in  an increased net cash use of million 
this increased net use of cash was principally due to i million of cash used in to retire our million senior notes  ii an increase of million paid in for dividends  principally due to the increased dividends declared per share see discussion following in this section and iii the fact that included proceeds  net of issuance costs  of million from the issuance of kinder morgan management shares and million of net proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes due september  partially offsetting these factors were i a million increase during in cash flows related to short term borrowing  ii the fact that included cash used for repayment of million of floating rate notes and million for the early retirement of our debentures due september  and our sinking fund debentures due september  see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  iii a million decreased use of cash during to repurchase shares and iv a million increased source of cash from net repayment of short term advances to unconsolidated affiliates during net cash flows provided by financing activities decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease is principally due to i the fact that and included proceeds  net of issuance costs  of million and million  respectively  from the issuance of kinder morgan management shares  ii a million decrease during in net short term borrowing  iii the issuance of million of floating rate notes in and the repayment of those notes during and iv million of cash used in for the early retirement of our debentures due september  and our sinking fund debentures due september  see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting this net decrease in cash inflows were i million of net proceeds received in from the issuance of our senior notes due september   ii the fact that included a million cash outflow for the early extinguishment of three series of debt securities see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and iii a reduction of million in purchases of treasury stock 
total cash payments for dividends were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in these amounts are principally due to increases in the dividends declared per common share and  to a minor extent  to increased shares outstanding 
in january  we increased our quarterly common dividend to per share annualized and announced our expectation for annual increases in the dividend in the future 
on february   we paid a dividend at the increased rate of per share to shareholders of record as of january  litigation and environmental our anticipated environmental capital costs and expenses for  including expected costs for remediation efforts  are approximately million  compared to approximately million of such costs and expenses incurred in a substantial portion of our environmental costs are either recoverable through insurance and indemnification provisions or have previously recorded liabilities associated with them 
we had an established environmental reserve of approximately million at december   to address remediation issues associated with approximately projects 
this reserve is primarily established to address and clean up soil and ground water impacts from former releases to the environment at facilities we have acquired 
reserves for each project are generally established by reviewing existing documents  conducting interviews and performing site inspections to determine the overall size and impact to the environment 
reviews are made on a quarterly basis to determine the status of the cleanup and the costs associated with the effort and to identify if the reserve allocation is appropriately valued 
in assessing environmental risks in conjunction with proposed acquisitions  we review records relating to environmental issues  conduct site inspections  interview employees  and  if appropriate  collect soil and groundwater samples 
after consideration of reserves established  we believe that costs for environmental remediation and ongoing compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial position or results of operations or diminish our ability to operate our businesses 
however  there can be no assurances that future events  such as changes in existing laws  the promulgation of new laws  or the development or discovery of new or existing facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant unanticipated costs 
refer to notes a and b of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pending environmental and litigation matters  respectively 
we believe we have established adequate environmental and legal reserves such that the resolution of pending environmental matters and litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business  cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
however  changing circumstances could cause these matters to have a material adverse impact 
regulation on november   the ferc issued order no 
 adopting new standards of conduct to govern interactions between interstate natural gas pipelines and their affiliates 
these affiliates include intrastate hinshaw pipelines  processors and gatherers and any company involved in gas or electric markets  even if they do not ship on the affiliated interstate pipeline 
on february   natural gas pipeline company of america  transcolorado gas transmission company  canyon creek compression company and horizon pipeline company filed their compliance plans under order no 
in addition  on february   all of these interstate pipelines filed a joint request with the interstate pipelines owned by kinder morgan energy partners asking that their interaction with intrastate hinshaw pipeline affiliates be exempted from the standards of conduct 
we expect the one time costs of compliance with the order  assuming the request to exempt intrastate pipeline affiliates is granted  to range from  to  to be shared between us and kinder morgan energy partners 
the pipeline safety improvement act of was signed into law on december   providing guidelines in the areas of testing  education  training and communication 
the act requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as high consequence areas 
pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests within years of the date of enactment and must perform subsequent integrity tests on a seven year cycle 
at least percent of the highest risk segments must be tested within five years of the enactment date 
the risk ratings are based on numerous factors  including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline  as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating 
testing will consist of hydrostatic testing  internal electronic testing  or direct assessment of the piping 
in addition  within one year of the law s enactment  pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained  using criteria the us department of transportation is responsible for providing 
natural gas pipeline company of america estimates that the average annual incremental expenditure associated with the pipeline safety improvement act of will be approximately million to million dollars

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the following discussion should be read in conjunction with note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information on our risk management activities 
our derivative activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  collectively  statement  which we adopted january  we enter into derivative contracts solely for the purpose of hedging exposures that accompany our normal business activities 
as a result of the adoption of statement  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments utilized for hedging activities as of january  a loss of million was reported as accumulated other comprehensive income 
in accordance with the provisions of statement  we designated these instruments as hedges of various exposures as discussed following  and we test the effectiveness of changes in the value of these hedging instruments with the risk being hedged 
hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in income in the period in which it occurs 
we enter into these transactions only with counterparties whose debt securities are rated investment grade by the major rating agencies 
in general  the risk of default by these counterparties is low 
during the fourth quarter of  however  we determined that enron corp 
was no longer likely to honor the obligations it had to us in conjunction with derivatives we were accounting for as hedges under statement upon making that determination  we i ceased to account for those derivatives as hedges  ii entered into new derivative transactions with other counterparties to replace our position with enron  iii designated the replacement derivative positions as hedges of the exposures that had been hedged with the enron positions and iv recognized a million pre tax loss included with general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for in recognition of the fact that it was unlikely that we would be paid the amounts then owed under the contracts with enron 
while we will continue to enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that additional losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
our businesses require that we purchase  sell and consume natural gas 
specifically  we purchase  sell and or consume natural gas i to serve our regulated natural gas distribution sales customers  ii to serve certain of our retail natural gas distribution customers in areas where regulatory restructuring has provided for competition in natural gas supply  for customers who have selected the company as their supplier of choice under our choice gas program  iii as fuel in certain of our colorado power generation facilities  iv as fuel for compressors located on natural gas pipeline company of america s pipeline system and v for operational sales of gas by natural gas pipeline company of america 
with respect to item i  we have no commodity risk because the regulated retail gas distribution regulatory structure provides that actual gas cost is passed through to our customers 
with respect to item iii  only one of these power generation facilities is not covered by a long term  fixed price gas supply agreement at a level sufficient for the current and projected capacity utilization 
with respect to item iv  this fuel is supplied by in kind fuel recoveries that are part of the transportation tariff 
items ii  v and the one power facility included under item iii that is not covered by a long term fixed price natural gas supply agreement  give rise to natural gas commodity price risk which we have chosen to substantially mitigate through our risk management program  utilizing financial derivative products 
under our choice gas program  customers in certain areas served by kinder morgan retail are allowed to choose their natural gas supplier from a list of qualified suppliers  although the transportation of the natural gas to the homes and businesses continues to be provided by kinder morgan retail in all cases 
when those customers choose kinder morgan retail as their choice gas supplier  we enter into agreements providing for sales of gas to these customers during a one year period at fixed prices per unit  but variable volumes 
we mitigate the risk associated with these anticipated sales of gas by purchasing natural gas futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange nymex and  as applicable  over the counter basis swaps to mitigate the risk associated with the difference in price changes between henry hub nymex basis and the expected physical delivery location 
in addition  we mitigate a portion of the volumetric risk through the purchase of over the counter natural gas options 
the time period covered by this risk management strategy does not extend beyond one year 
with respect to the power generation facility described above that is not covered by an adequately sized  fixed price gas supply contract  we are exposed to changes in the price of natural gas as we purchase it to use as fuel for the electricity generating turbines 
in order to mitigate this exposure  we purchase natural gas futures on the nymex and  as discussed above  over the counter basis swaps on the nymex  in amounts representing our expected fuel usage in the near term 
in general  we do not hedge this exposure for periods longer than one year 
with respect to operational sales of natural gas made by natural gas pipeline company of america  we are exposed to risk associated with changes in the price of natural gas during the periods in which these sales are made 
we mitigate this risk by selling natural gas futures and  as discussed above  over the counter basis swaps  on the nymex in the periods in which we expect to make these sales 
in general  we do not hedge this exposure for periods in excess of months 
we use a value at risk model to measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas and natural gas liquids markets 
value at risk is a statistical measure of how much the marked to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we use a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
our value at risk computations use a confidence level of percent for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a percent probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk amount presented 
instruments evaluated by the model include forward physical gas  storage and transportation contracts and financial products including commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options 
during  value at risk reached a high of million and a low of million 
value at risk at december   was million and  based on quarter end values  averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivatives assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed preceding  we enter into these derivatives solely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany our normal business activities and  therefore  the change in the market value of our portfolio of derivatives is  with the exception of a minor amount of hedging inefficiency  offset by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 
during the three years ended december   all of our natural gas derivative activities were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges 
we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately  in and pre tax losses of approximately  and  in and  respectively  as a result of ineffectiveness of these hedges  which amounts are reported within the caption gas purchases and other costs of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
there was no component of these derivative instruments gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
as the hedged sales and purchases take place and we record them into earnings  we will also reclassify the gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings 
we expect to reclassify into earnings  during  substantially all of the million balance in accumulated other comprehensive income representing unrecognized net losses on derivative activities at december  during the three years ended december   we reclassified no gains or losses into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges due to a determination that the forecasted transactions would no longer occur by the end of the originally specified time period 
we also provide certain administrative risk management services to kinder morgan energy partners  although kinder morgan energy partners retains the obligations and rights arising from all derivative transactions entered into on its behalf 
our business activities expose us to credit risk with respect to collection of accounts receivable 
in order to mitigate that risk  we routinely monitor the credit status of our existing and potential customers 
when customers credit ratings do not meet our requirements for the extension of unsupported credit  we obtain cash prepayments or letters of credit 
note g of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements provides information on the amount of prepayments we have received 
we have outstanding fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of billion at december  these agreements  entered into in august  september and november  effectively convert the interest expense associated with our debentures due in and our senior notes due in from fixed rates to floating rates based on the three month london interbank offered rate libor plus a credit spread 
these swaps have been designated as fair value hedges and we have accounted for them utilizing the shortcut method prescribed for qualifying fair value hedges under statement accordingly  the carrying value of the swap is adjusted to its fair value as of the end of each reporting period  and an offsetting entry is made to adjust the carrying value of the debt securities whose fair value is being hedged 
the fair value of these swaps of million at december  is included in the caption deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we record interest expense equal to the floating rate payments  which is accrued monthly and paid semi annually 
based on the long term debt effectively converted to floating rate debt as a result of the swaps discussed above and our outstanding commercial paper balance at december   the market risk related to a one percent change in interest rates would result in a million annual impact on pre tax income 
on march   we terminated the interest rate swap agreements associated with our senior notes due in and received million 
we are amortizing this amount reducing interest expense over the remaining period the senior notes are outstanding 
the unamortized balance of million at december  is included in the caption value of interest rate swaps under the heading long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
