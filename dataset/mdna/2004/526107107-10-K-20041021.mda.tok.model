regulation the company s operations are subject to evolving and often increasingly stringent international  federal  state  and local laws and regulations concerning the environment 
environmental laws that affect or could affect the company s domestic operations include  among others  the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the occupational safety and health act  the national environmental policy act  the toxic substances control act  any regulations promulgated under these acts and various other federal  state and local laws and regulations governing environmental matters

refrigerants 
in the past there has been regulatory and political pressure to phase out the use of certain ozone depleting substances  including hydrochlorofluorocarbons  which are sometimes referred to as hcfcs 
this development is of particular importance to the company and its competitors because of the common usage of hcfcs as refrigerants for air conditioning and refrigeration equipment 
this will not occur prior to and the company is prepared to introduce new product offerings that will replace hcfcs as the refrigerant fluid with an approved alternative 
as discussed below  the company does not believe implementation of the phase out schedule for hcfcs contained in the current regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
the company does believe  however  there will likely be continued pressure by the international environmental community for the united states and other countries to accelerate the phase out schedule 
the company has been an active participant in the ongoing international dialogue on these issues and believes that it is well positioned to react to any changes in the regulatory landscape 
in  the united states became a signatory to an international agreement titled the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer 
the montreal protocol requires its signatories to phase out hcfcs on a predictable and orderly basis 
all countries in the developed world have become signatories to the montreal protocol 
the manner in which these countries implement the montreal protocol and regulate 
table of contents hcfcs differs widely 
the us clean air act amendments implement the montreal protocol by establishing a program to limit the production  importation and use of specified ozone depleting substances  including hcfcs currently used as refrigerants by the company and its competitors 
under the clean air act and implementing regulations  all hcfcs must be phased out between and the company believes these regulations  as currently in effect  will not have a material adverse effect on its operations 
the company  together with major chemical manufacturers  is reviewing and addressing the potential impact of refrigerant regulations on its products 
the company believes the combination of products that presently utilize hcfcs and new products utilizing alternative refrigerants being phased in will allow it to offer a complete line of commercial and industrial products 
therefore  the company does not foresee any material adverse impact on its business or competitive position as a result of the montreal protocol  the clean air act amendments or their implementing regulations 
however  the company believes the implementation of severe restrictions on the production  importation or use of refrigerants the company employs in larger quantities or acceleration of the current phase out schedule could have such an impact on the company and its competitors 
the company is subject to appliance efficiency regulations promulgated under the national appliance energy conservation act of  as amended  and various state regulations concerning the energy efficiency of its products 
the company has developed  and will continue to develop  products which comply with new national appliance energy conservation act regulations and does not believe that such regulations will have a material adverse effect on its business 
in  the united states department of energy began its review of national standards for comfort products covered under the national appliance energy conservation act 
the national appliance energy conservation act regulations requiring manufacturers to phase in new higher efficiency products becomes effective in january the company believes it is well positioned to comply with the new standards promulgated by the department of energy and does not foresee any adverse material impact from a national appliance energy conservation act standard change 
remediation activity 
in addition to affecting the company s ongoing operations  applicable environmental laws can impose obligations to remediate hazardous substances at its properties  at properties formerly owned or operated by the company and at facilities to which it has sent or sends waste for treatment or disposal 
the company s former grenada facility  now part of a joint venture  is subject to an administrative order issued by the mississippi department of environmental quality under which the company is conducting groundwater remediation 
the expenditures from this groundwater remediation are not expected to materially affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company is aware of contamination at some of its other facilities  however  the company does not presently believe that any future remediation costs at such facilities will be material 
the company has received notices in the past that it is a potentially responsible party along with other potentially responsible parties in superfund proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act for cleanup of hazardous substances at certain sites to which the potentially responsible parties are alleged to have sent waste 
based on the facts presently known  the company does not believe environmental cleanup costs associated with any superfund sites where the company has received notice that it is a potentially responsible party will be material

the number of units that are expected to be repaired or replaced is determined by applying the estimated failure rate  which is generally based on historical experience  to the number of units that have been sold and are still under warranty 
the estimated units to be repaired under warranty are multiplied by the average cost undiscounted to repair or replace such products to determine the company s estimated future warranty cost
