item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity summary 
our financial condition and liquidity depends on the cash flow from our two principal subsidiaries and borrowings under our bank loan agreement 
our cash flow is influenced mainly by the prices we receive for our natural gas production  the demand for and the dayrates we receive for our drilling rigs and  to a lesser extent  the prices we receive for our oil production 
at december   we had cash totaling  and we had borrowed  under our loan agreement 
over the last six months of the average monthly natural gas price we received excluding the impact of hedging  ranged from in october to in december and the average nymex henry hub daily price for the same time period ranged from to 
with the average nymex contract settle price for the next twelve months at on february   we expect natural gas prices to remain at levels that will increase demand for our rigs and provide upward movement on the rates we receive for our contract drilling services 
there is  however  no assurance that these prices will actually be sustained throughout the following is a summary of certain financial information as of december  and for the year ended december  working capital

in december  we acquired serdrilco incorporated for million in cash 
to finance the acquisition we sold million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
our bank loan agreement 
at december   we had a million bank loan agreement consisting of a revolving credit facility through may  and a term loan thereafter  maturing on may  on january   in conjunction with our acquisition of petrocorp incorporated  we replaced our loan agreement with a revolving credit facility totaling million having a four year term ending january  borrowings under the new credit facility are limited to a commitment amount 
although the current value of our assets under the latest loan value computation supported the full million  we elected to set the loan commitment at million in order to reduce financing costs since we are charged a commitment fee of 
of on the amount available but not borrowed 
we paid origination  agency and syndication fees of  at the inception of the new agreement   of which will be paid annually and the remainder of the fees amortized over the four year life of the loan 
following the acquisition of petrocorp incorporated our borrowings were million on february  the loan value under our current credit facility is subject to a semi annual re determination on may and november of each year  beginning may  the calculation is based primarily on the sum of a percentage of the discounted future value of our oil and natural gas reserves  as determined by the banks 
in addition  an amount representing a part of the value of our drilling rig fleet  limited to million  is added to the loan value 
provisions are also in the agreement which allow for one requested special re determination of the borrowing base by either the lender or us between each scheduled re determination date if conditions warrant such a request 
at our election  any portion of the debt outstanding may be fixed at a eurodollar rate for   or day terms 
during any eurodollar rate funding period the outstanding principal balance of the note to which such eurodollar rate option applies may be repaid upon three days prior notice to the administrative agent 
interest on the eurodollar rate is computed at the eurodollar base rate applicable for the interest period plus to depending on the level of debt as a percentage of the total loan value and is payable at the end of each term or every days whichever is less 
borrowings not under the eurodollar rate bear interest at the jpmorgan chase prime rate payable at the end of each month and the principal borrowed may be paid anytime in part or in whole without premium or penalty 
at february   all of our million debt was subject to the eurodollar rate 
the loan agreement includes prohibitions against 
the payment of dividends other than stock dividends during any fiscal year in excess of of our consolidated net income for the preceding fiscal year  
the incurrence of additional debt with certain very limited exceptions and 
the creation or existence of mortgages or liens  other than those in the ordinary course of business  on any of our property  except in favor of our banks 
the loan agreement also requires that at the end of each quarter 
consolidated net worth of at least million  
a current ratio as defined in the loan agreement of not less than to and 
a leverage ratio of long term debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the loan agreement for the most recently ended rolling four fiscal quarters of no greater than to hedging 
periodically we hedge the prices we will receive for a portion of our future natural gas and oil production 
we do so in an attempt to reduce the impact and uncertainty that price variations have on our cash flow 
we entered into a collar contract covering approximately of our daily oil production for january and february of the collar had a floor of per barrel and a ceiling of per barrel and we received per barrel for entering into the transaction 
during the first quarter of  our oil hedging transaction yielded an increase in our oil revenues of  during the second quarter of  we entered into a natural gas collar contract for approximately of our june and july production  at a floor price of and a ceiling price of 
during the third quarter of  we entered into two natural gas collar contracts for approximately of our september through november natural gas production 
both contracts had a floor price of 
one contract had a ceiling of and the other contract had a ceiling of 
during the year of  the collar contracts increased natural gas revenues by  on april   we entered into a collar contract covering approximately of our natural gas production for the periods of april  through october  the collar had a floor of and a ceiling of 
during the year of  our natural gas hedging transactions increased natural gas revenues by  we did not have any hedging transactions outstanding at december  during the first quarter of  we entered into two collar contracts covering approximately of our natural gas production for the periods of april  through september  one collar had a floor of and a ceiling of and the other collar had a floor of and a ceiling of 
we also entered into two collar contracts covering approximately of our oil production for the periods of may  through december  one collar had a floor of and a ceiling of and the other collar had a floor of and a ceiling of 
during the year of  the collar contracts decreased natural gas revenues by  and oil revenues by  we did not have any hedging transactions outstanding at december  in january  we entered into a natural gas collar covering approximately of our estimated natural gas production 
the transaction covers the periods of april through october of and has a floor of and a ceiling of 
we also entered into an oil hedge covering approximately of our estimated oil production 
the transaction covers the periods of february through december of and has an average price of 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  general liability  property damage and employee medical benefits 
the exposure ie our deductible or retention per occurrence ranges from  for general liability to million for rig physical damage 
we have purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit  to the extent feasible  our per occurrence and aggregate exposure to certain claims 
there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
following the acquisition of serdrilco we have continued to use its erisa governed occupational injury benefit plan to cover its employees in lieu of covering them under an insured texas workers compensation plan 
impact of prices for our oil and natural gas 
with the acquisition of petrocorp incorporated as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  natural gas comprises of our total oil and natural gas reserves 
before the acquisition  natural gas comprised of our reserves 
any significant change in natural gas prices has a material affect on our revenues  cash flow and the value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
generally  prices and demand for domestic natural gas are influenced by weather conditions  supply imbalances and by world wide oil price levels 
domestic oil prices are primarily influenced by world oil market developments 
all of these factors are beyond our control and we can not predict nor measure their future influence on the prices we will receive 
based on our production in  a 
per mcf change in what we are paid for our natural gas production would result in a corresponding  per month  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
our average natural gas price was compared to an average natural gas price of for a per barrel change in our oil price would have a  per month  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow based on our production in our average oil price was compared with an average oil price of received in because natural gas prices have such a significant affect on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves  declines in these prices can result in a decline in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
price declines can also adversely affect the semi annual determination of the amount available for us to borrow under our bank loan agreement since that determination is based mainly on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
such a reduction could limit our ability to carry out our planned capital projects 
we sell most of our natural gas production to third parties under month to month contracts 
several of these buyers have experienced financial complications resulting from the recent investigations into the energy trading industry 
the long term implications to the energy trading business  as well as to oil and natural gas producers  because of these investigations remains  to be determined 
we continue to evaluate the information available to us about our buyers and try to reduce any possible future adverse impact to us 
presently we believe that our buyers will be able to perform their commitments to us 
for  purchases by cinergy marketing trading lp accounted for approximately of our oil and natural gas revenues while purchases by centerpoint energy gas accounted for approximately of our oil and natural gas revenues 
we own a limited partner interest in eagle energy partners i lp  whose purchases  which are competitively marketed  accounted for of our oil and natural gas revenues in we have increased our sales to eagle energy partners i lp since we first started selling natural gas to them in august  for the period august through december eagle has purchased of our oil and natural gas revenues and they marketed approximately of the natural gas volumes we sold for ourselves and third parties during the same five month period 
oil and natural gas acquisitions and capital expenditures 
most of our capital expenditures are discretionary and directed toward future growth 
our decision to increase our oil and natural gas reserves through acquisitions or through drilling depends on the prevailing or expected market conditions  potential return on investment  future drilling potential and opportunities to obtain financing under the circumstances involved  all of which provide us with a large degree of flexibility in deciding when to incur such costs 
we drilled wells net wells in compared to wells net wells in our total capital expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration and acquisitions in totaled million excluding capitalized cost for the recording of the plugging liability associated with our wells 
based on current prices  we plan to drill an estimated to wells in and total capital expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration and acquisitions is planned to be around million 
contract drilling 
our drilling work is subject to many factors that influence the number of rigs we have working as well as the costs and revenues associated with such work 
these factors include competition from other drilling contractors  the prevailing prices for natural gas and oil  availability and cost of labor to run our rigs and our ability to supply the equipment needed 
we have not encountered major difficulty in hiring and keeping rig crews  but such shortages have occurred periodically in the past 
if demand for drilling rigs increases rapidly in the future  shortages of experienced personnel may limit our ability to increase the number of rigs we could operate 
most of our contract drilling fleet is targeted to the drilling of natural gas wells  so changes in natural gas prices influence the demand for our drilling rigs and the prices we can charge for our contract drilling services 
in the last half of and throughout  as oil and natural gas prices increased  we experienced a big increase in demand for our rigs 
demand continued to increase until the end of the third quarter of and reached a high when of our rigs were working in july because of declining natural gas prices throughout  demand for our rigs dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of and stabilized with between and rigs operating in the first half of the rates received for our rigs also began to fall until they reached a low of  per day in february of natural gas and oil prices once again began to rise during the last half of and in the second quarter of through the remainder of the year both demand for our rigs and dayrates continued to improve 
in december the average dayrate on the rig fleet owned by us throughout was approximately  per day and the service rigs added in december had a dayrate of approximately  making the average dayrate for the rig fleet  in december the average use of our rigs in was rigs compared with rigs for our average dayrate in was  compared to  for based on the average utilization of our rigs in  a per day change in dayrates has a  per day  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
utilization and dayrates for our drilling rigs will depend mainly on the price of natural gas 
our contract drilling subsidiary provides drilling services for our exploration and production subsidiary 
the contracts for these services are issued under the same conditions and rates as the contracts we have entered into with unrelated third parties 
during  we drilled wells for our exploration and production subsidiary 
per regulations provided by the securities and exchange commission  the profit received by our contract drilling segment of  and  during and  respectively  was used to reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties rather than being included in our profits in current operations 
drilling acquisitions and capital expenditures 
on december   we acquired serdrilco incorporated and its subsidiary  service drilling southwest llc for million in cash 
the terms of the acquisition include an earn out provision allowing the sellers to obtain one half of the cash flow in excess of million for each of the three years following the acquisition 
the assets of serdrilco incorporated included drilling rigs  spare drilling equipment  a fleet of larger trucks and trailers  various other vehicles and a district office and an equipment yard in and near borger  texas 
for our contract drilling operations during  we incurred million in capital expenditures  which includes million in cash and million for goodwill resulting from deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with the serdrilco acquisition 
for the year  we have budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million for our contract drilling operations 
oil and natural gas limited partnerships and other entity relationships 
we are the general partner for oil and natural gas partnerships which were formed privately and publicly 
the partnership s revenues and costs are shared under formulas prescribed in each limited partnership agreement 
the partnerships repay us for contract drilling  well supervision and general and administrative expense 
related party transactions for contract drilling and well supervision fees are the related party s share of such costs 
these costs are billed on the same basis as billings to unrelated third parties for similar services 
general and administrative reimbursements consist of direct general and administrative expense incurred on the related party s behalf as well as indirect expenses assigned to the related parties 
allocations are based on the related party s level of activity and are considered by management to be reasonable 
during  and  the total paid to us for all of these fees was   and  respectively 
we expect the fees to be about the same in our proportionate share of assets  liabilities and net income relating to the oil and natural gas partnerships is included in our consolidated financial statements 
we own a equity interest in superior pipeline company llc  an oklahoma limited liability company 
superior is a natural gas gathering and processing company 
our investment  including our share of the equity in the earnings of this company  totaled million at december  and is reported in other assets in our accompanying balance sheet 
during  superior pipeline company llc purchased million of our natural gas production and paid  for our natural gas liquids 
we paid this company  for gathering and compression services 
we also own a limited partnership interest in eagle energy partnership i  lp eagle  carried at cost  for million 
eagle is engaged in the purchase and sale of natural gas  electricity or similar electricity based products  future commodities  and the performance of scheduling and nomination services for both energy related commodities and similar energy management functions 
eagle was marketing approximately of the natural gas volumes we sell for ourselves and third parties in december and during february they are marketing 
contractual commitments 
we have the following contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less contractual than after obligations total year years years years in thousands bank debt retirement agreement  operating leases   total contractual obligations     see previous discussion in management discussion and analysis regarding bank debt 
the obligation is presented in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement signed on january  in the second quarter of  we recorded million in additional employee benefit expenses for the present value of a separation agreement made in connection with the retirement of king kirchner from his position as chief executive officer 
the liability associated with this expense  including accrued interest  will be paid in monthly payments of  starting in july and continuing through june the liability as presented above is undiscounted 
we lease office space in tulsa and woodward  oklahoma and houston  texas under the terms of operating leases expiring through january  along with leasing space on short term commitments to stack excess rig equipment and production inventory 
in the first quarter of  we renegotiated our rental agreement for the tulsa office reducing the price per square foot while adding additional space and lengthening the term of the agreement to january  at december   we also have the following commitments and contingencies that could create  increase or accelerate our liabilities amount of commitment expiration per period total amount committed less other or than after commitments accrued year years years years in thousands deferred compensation agreement  unknown unknown unknown unknown separation benefit agreement  unknown unknown unknown plugging liability   gas balancing liability  unknown unknown unknown unknown repurchase obliga tions unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown we provide a salary deferral plan which allows participants to defer the recognition of salary for income tax purposes until actual distribution of benefits  which occurs at either termination of employment  death or certain defined unforeseeable emergency hardships 
we recognize payroll expense and record a liability  included in other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  at the time of deferral 
effective january   we adopted a separation benefit plan separation plan 
the separation plan allows eligible employees whose employment with us is involuntarily terminated or  in the case of an employee who has completed years of service  voluntarily or involuntarily terminated  to receive benefits equivalent to weeks salary for every whole year of service completed with unit up to a maximum of weeks 
to receive payments the recipient must waive any claims against us in exchange for receiving the separation benefits 
on october   we adopted a separation benefit plan for senior management senior plan 
the senior plan provides certain officers and key executives of unit with benefits generally equivalent to the separation plan 
the compensation committee of the board of directors has absolute discretion in the selection of the individuals covered in this plan 
on january  we adopted financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas establishes an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets mainly plugging and abandonment costs for our depleted wells in the period in which the liability is incurred at the time the wells are drilled or acquired 
we have a liability recorded for certain properties where we believe there are insufficient reserves available to allow the under produced owners to recover their under production from future production volumes 
we formed the unit oil and gas limited partnership and the energy income limited partnership along with private limited partnerships the partnerships with certain qualified employees  officers and directors from through  with a subsidiary of ours serving as general partner 
the partnerships were formed for the purpose of conducting oil and natural gas acquisition  drilling and development operations and serving as co general partner with us in any additional limited partnerships formed during that year 
the partnerships participated on a proportionate basis with us in most drilling operations and most producing property acquisitions commenced by us for our own account during the period from the formation of the partnership through december of that year 
these partnership agreements require  upon the election of a limited partner  that we repurchase the limited partner s interest at amounts to be determined by appraisal in the future 
such repurchases in any one year are limited to of the units outstanding 
we made repurchases of  and  in and  respectively  for such limited partners interests 
no repurchases were made in critical accounting policies 
we account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
at the end of each quarter  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties is limited to the lower of unamortized cost or a ceiling 
the ceiling is defined as the sum of the present value discount rate of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  based on period end oil and natural gas prices adjusted for hedging  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties not included in the costs being amortized  less related income taxes 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling  we are subject to a write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
if required  it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
once incurred  a write down cannot be reversed even if prices subsequently recover 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or if we have large downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low oil or natural gas prices  even if temporary  increases the chance of a ceiling test write down 
based on oil and natural gas prices on december  per mcf for natural gas and per barrel for oil  the unamortized cost of our domestic oil and natural gas properties did not exceed the ceiling of our proved oil and natural gas reserves 
natural gas prices remain erratic and any significant declines below prices used in the reserve evaluation could result in a ceiling test write down in following quarterly reporting periods 
the value of our oil and natural gas reserves is used to determine the borrowing base under our loan agreement with our banks 
this amount is affected by both price changes and the measurement of reserve volumes 
oil and natural gas reserves cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of oil and natural gas reserves require extensive judgments of our reservoir engineering data and are less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
indeed the uncertainties inherent in the disclosure are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we use the sales method for recording natural gas sales 
this method allows for recognition of revenue  which may be more or less than our share of pro rata production from certain wells 
our policy is to expense our pro rata share of lease operating costs from all wells as incurred 
such expenses relating to the natural gas balancing position on wells in which we have an imbalance are not material 
drilling equipment  transportation equipment and other property and equipment are carried at cost 
renewals and betterments are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed 
realization of the carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
assets are determined to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows directly related to the asset including disposal value if any  is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if any asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
an estimate of fair value is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets 
changes in such estimates could cause us to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment 
we recognize revenues and expense generated from daywork drilling contracts as the services are performed  since we do not bear the risk of completion of the well 
under footage and turnkey contracts  we bear the risk of completion of the well  so revenues and expenses are recognized when the well is substantially completed 
under this method  substantial completion is determined when the well bore reaches the negotiated depth as stated in the contract 
the entire amount of a loss  if any  is recorded when the loss can be reasonably determined  however  any profit is recorded only at the time the well is finished 
the costs of uncompleted drilling contracts include expenses incurred to date on footage or turnkey contracts  which are still in process at the end of the period  and are included in other current assets 
effects of inflation the effect of inflation in the oil and natural gas industry is primarily driven by the prices realized for oil and natural gas 
increased commodity prices increase demand for contract drilling rigs and services which support higher rig activity 
this in turn affects the overall demand for our rigs and the dayrates we can obtain for our contract drilling services 
before  the effect of inflation on our operations was minimal due to low inflation rates  relatively low natural gas and oil prices and moderate demand for our contract drilling services 
over the last four years natural gas and oil prices have been more volatile  and during periods of higher utilization we have experienced increases in labor cost and the cost of services to support our rigs 
during this same period when commodity prices did decline labor rates did not come back down to the levels incurred before the increases 
if natural gas prices increased substantially for a long period  shortages in support equipment such as drill pipe  third party services and qualified labor could occur resulting in additional corresponding increases in our material and labor costs 
these conditions may limit our ability to realize improvements in operating profits 
how inflation will affect us in the future will depend on additional increases  if any  realized in our drilling rig rates and the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas 
new accounting pronouncements on january  we adopted financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas establishes an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
we own oil and natural gas properties which require expenditures to plug and abandon the wells when the oil and natural gas reserves in the wells are depleted 
these expenditures under fas are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred at the time the wells are drilled or acquired 
we do not have any assets restricted for the purpose of settling the plugging liabilities 
the effect of this change increased net property  plant and equipment by million and liabilities  including deferred tax liabilities  by million at january  and decreased net income for the year ended december  by  per share 
the financial statements for the year ended december  have not been restated and the cumulative effect of the change of million net of tax per share is shown as a one time addition to income in the first quarter of on january   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin  as amended  was effective for us in the fourth quarter of as it applies to entities created after february  the adoption of fin with respect to these entities  did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
for entities created prior to february   which are not special purpose entities  as defined in fin  we will have to adopt fin  as amended  in the quarter ending march  we are still evaluating fin with regard to these types of entities in which we have an ownership interest  primarily our oil and gas partnerships and our equity investment in superior pipeline 
fin may require full consolidation of these entities which would increase our total assets with an offsetting minority interest for the percentage not owned by unit 
there will be no net impact to our results of operations from the adoption of fin statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas and statement of financial accounting standards  no 
 goodwill and intangible assets fas were issued by the fasb in june and became effective for us on july  and january   respectively 
fas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
additionally  fas requires companies to disaggregate and report separately from goodwill certain intangible assets 
fas establishes new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under fas  goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized  but rather are reviewed annually for impairment 
depending on how the accounting and disclosure literature is applied  oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract oil and natural gas reserves for both undeveloped and developed leaseholds may be classified separately from oil and gas properties  as intangible assets on our balance sheets 
in addition  the notes to our financial statements would include the disclosures required by fas and regarding intangibles 
to date  we  like many other oil and gas companies  have included oil and gas extraction rights as part of the oil and gas properties  even after fas and became effective 
our results of operations and cash flows would not be affected  since these oil and gas mineral extraction rights would continue to be amortized in accordance with full cost accounting rules 
at december  and  we had undeveloped leaseholds of approximately million and million  respectively that would be classified on our balance sheets as intangible undeveloped leasehold and developed leaseholds of an estimated million and million  respectively that would be classified as intangible developed leasehold if the interpretations were applied 
this classification would require us to make the disclosures set forth under fas related to these interests 
we intend to continue to classify our oil and gas mineral extraction rights as tangible oil and gas properties until further guidance is provided

total operating cost increased primarily from higher gross production taxes resulting from higher revenues

operator demand for our rigs increased gradually throughout as natural gas prices increased in versus and resulted in higher rig use and dayrates for our rigs 
higher dayrates were offset by higher rig expense as we experienced a increase in ad valorem taxes on our rigs and a increase in worker s compensation expense 
we expect both of these expenses  along with increased demand for quality labor within the industry  to keep upward pressure on rig costs throughout approximately of our total drilling revenues in came from footage and turnkey contracts  which had profit margins lower than our daywork contracts 
nine percent of our total drilling revenues came from footage and turnkey contracts in contract drilling depreciation increased due to the acquisition of rigs in august of and additional rig use 
general and administrative expense was higher in due to an increase in general liability insurance  director and officer insurance and increased corporate administrative cost

total dd a on our oil and natural gas properties increased due to the increase in the dd a rate in  which resulted from higher development drilling cost per equivalent mcf 
the increase would have been larger  but included in dd a was the write down of our investment in shenandoah resources ltd 
in shenandoah started experiencing financial difficulties and its stock price declined  so we took a write down in our investment of million to reduce the carrying value to the market value of shenandoah s stock 
in august  the assets of shenandoah were liquidated for the benefit of the secured creditors and  as a result  our remaining investment of  in shenandoah was written off 
reduced natural gas prices  especially in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  caused decreases in operator demand for contract drilling rigs within our working area and resulted in lower rig use and dayrates for our rigs 
total drilling operating costs were relatively unchanged between the two years 
approximately of our total drilling revenues in came from footage and turnkey contracts  which had profit margins lower than our daywork contracts 
one percent of our total drilling revenues came from footage and turnkey contracts in contract drilling depreciation increased due to the acquisition of rigs in august of the increase was partially offset by lower rig use 
general and administrative expense was higher in due to increases in labor cost  insurance expense and outside contract services 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million in additional employee benefit expenses for the present value of a separation agreement made in connection with the retirement of king kirchner from his position as chief executive officer 
the liability associated with this expense plus accrued interest will be paid in  monthly payments starting in july and continuing through june our total interest expense is lower due to lower interest rates along with a substantial reduction in our long term debt 
income tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk 
our major market risk exposure is in the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
the price we receive is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and market prices applicable to our natural gas production 
historically  prices we received for our oil and natural gas production fluctuated and such fluctuation is expected to continue 
the price of natural gas also effects the demand for our rigs and the amount we can charge for the use of the rigs 
based on our production  a 
per mcf change in what we are paid for our natural gas production would result in a corresponding  per month  annualized change in our pre tax cash flow 
a per barrel change in our oil price would have a  per month  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow
