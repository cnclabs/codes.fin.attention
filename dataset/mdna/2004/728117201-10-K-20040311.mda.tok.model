item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception in as the publisher of playboy magazine  we have become a world leader in the development and distribution of multimedia entertainment for adult audiences 
today  our businesses are classified into four reportable segments entertainment  publishing  online and licensing 
we formerly operated a catalog segment  which we exited in we operate in competitive industries and seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition by leveraging our worldwide brand strength into multiple media and by developing and delivering unique high quality content which becomes part of our extensive libraries of photo images  print and internet editorial content and original movies and television programs 
another important aspect of our businesses consists of the licensing of our trademarks for the worldwide manufacture  sale and distribution of various consumer products and services 
our trademarks  which are renewable periodically and which can be renewed indefinitely  include playboy  the rabbit head design  playmate and spice 
we also own numerous domain names related to our online business 
our entertainment group represents the largest portion of our operating income  our online group is the fastest growing group  and the brand is driven by our licensing group as well as playboy magazine domestically and worldwide 
our strategic focus has not changed over the last several years 
we develop unique playboy style content that can be leveraged across our various media platforms and across geographic boundaries 
utilizing multiple technology and distribution channels  we will seek to extend our audience reach and related revenues primarily in our high margin electronic businesses of television and the internet 
our th anniversary and the new look of our magazine has developed momentum in our publishing group via advertising and newsstand sales and we will make efforts to continue that momentum in order to increase profitability and brand equity 
we continue to face a number of challenges in our efforts to profitably grow our businesses and to realize our strategies  including the continued industry consolidation of cable and satellite distributors  piracy and theft of service in the television arena  free internet content  as well as consolidation of newsstand wholesalers  all of which have the potential to exert pressure on our margins 
revenues we generate most of our entertainment group revenues from ppv and subscription fees for our television network offerings  including playboy tv and spice branded domestic and international networks 
our network revenues are affected by marketing and retail price  which are controlled by the distributors  our revenue splits with distributors  which are negotiated  and the demand for our programming 
a small portion of the entertainment group revenue is from the sale of dvds and home videos  which stem primarily from our network programming 
the majority of our publishing group revenues are derived from consumers via subscription and newsstand sales of playboy magazine and special editions 
additionally  the group generates advertising sales  as well as royalties on circulation and advertising  from our licensed international editions 
our subscription revenues are fairly consistent  while newsstand sales fluctuate and are typically higher for issues containing celebrity pictorials or other special content  such as articles or interviews 
the group s revenues fluctuate with the general condition of the local and national economy  which impacts newsstand sales as well as advertising buying patterns 
revenue can also fluctuate when we increase the price of issues containing major celebrities  holiday or other special issues such as our th anniversary issue 
the principal sources of our online group revenues are subscription revenues from our multiple club websites  which offer unique playboy or spice branded content  and from e commerce sales of playboy branded and other consumer products both online and through direct mail 
we also generate revenue through licensing fees from playboy 
com websites outside of the united states as well as from advertising and online gaming 
e commerce revenues are typically higher during the holiday buying season and subscription revenues are lower during the summer months due to decreased internet traffic 
licensing group revenues are principally generated from royalties received for the international and domestic licensing of our branded consumer products plus periodic auction sales of small portions of our art and memorabilia collection 
costs and operating expenses entertainment group expenses include programming amortization  network distribution  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
amortization expenses relate primarily to the expenditures associated with the creation of playboy programming and licensing of third party programming for our movie networks 
publishing group expenses include manufacturing  subscription promotion  editorial  shipping and general and administrative expenses 
manufacturing expenses  which include the production of the magazine  represent the largest operating expense of the group and fluctuate by issue due mainly to the cost of paper and the size of the magazine 
postage is also a major cost 
online group expenses consist of trademark license and administrative fees to the parent company  content  product fulfillment  sales and marketing  hosting and general and administrative expenses 
licensing group expenses include promotional expenses and general and administrative expenses 
corporate administration and promotion expenses include general corporate costs such as technology  legal  security  human resources  finance  investor relations and company wide marketing  communications and promotion  including the expenses related to the playboy mansion

higher newsstand and advertising revenues for the th anniversary issue  higher online subscription and e commerce  and higher licensing revenues also contributed to the overall increase 
operating income improved million  more than double the prior year  largely due to the swing to profitability of the online group as a result of growth in high margin subscription revenues 
increased playboy magazine revenues also contributed to the improvement 
the positive performance in the publishing  online and licensing groups was partially offset by expected lower revenues and operating income from our worldwide dvd home video business 
also affecting the comparison was a million restructuring charge taken in compared to a million restructuring charge in the current year 
net loss for the current year included an million charge related to a litigation settlement with logix as well as million of debt extinguishment expenses in connection with financing obligations  which were repaid upon completion of our debt offering in the first quarter of the prior year included a million non cash income tax charge related to our adoption of statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
entertainment group the following discussion focuses on the profit contribution of each of our entertainment group businesses before programming expense 
revenues from our domestic tv networks business increased million  or  for the year 
the increase was due  in part  to increases in digital home coverage  however  we believe that revenues continue to be negatively impacted by theft of service  which we also believe is an area of focus for the dth and cable operators 
we also believe that revenues have been impacted by customer resistance to increases in total prices for services and the resulting dissatisfaction with the overall value of digital service 
in general  our networks are digital services  carried by dth and cable operators  and we are therefore negatively affected by customer churn in digital cable 
the year reflects higher revenues related to playboy tv en espanol  which we now own and operate as part of our domestic television operation 
profit contribution for our domestic tv networks increased million  or  for the year  which was impacted by lower amortization of intangibles acquired in the acquisition described below  offset in part by higher distribution costs and overhead related to our first year in our new production facility 
in  we anticipate growth opportunities in our domestic tv business  from expected increases in digital home coverage  from technologies like svod and vod combined with marketing  in spite of the difficult negotiating environment with the cable and satellite distributors resulting from industry consolidation 
we are also utilizing our studio to provide playback  production control and origination services for third parties  which helps bring efficiencies and allows us to spread our fixed costs to operate the facility 
in july  we acquired the hot network  the hot zone and the related television assets of califa entertainment group  inc  or califa  and the vivid tv network and related television assets of vod  inc  which we refer to as the califa acquisition 
the following table illustrates certain information regarding approximate household units for our networks in millions household units dec

a single household can represent multiple household units if two or more of our networks and or multiple platforms ie digital and analog are available to that household 
in december  we completed the restructuring of the ownership of our international tv joint ventures with claxson 
the restructuring resulted in our acquiring full ownership of playboy tv and movie networks outside of the united states and canada  other than latin america and iberia 
the operating results of these networks are now consolidated in our operating results 
prior to the restructuring  we recorded only revenues from licensing and other fees in our operating results 
under the terms of the restructuring transaction  we increased our equity interest in networks in europe and the pacific far east 
we retained our existing ownership interest in the playboy tv and spice branded networks in latin america and iberia and acquired the equity in two japanese networks previously owned by ptvi 
profit contribution from our international tv business increased on revenue increases of million due to the impact of revenue consolidation from the restructuring 
the prior year included million in licensing fees from the ptvi joint venture  in which we held a minority interest 
we believe growth in our international tv business will come from both existing markets and new territories as the number of available household units and technology available to deliver television programming grows 
profit contribution from our worldwide dvd home video business decreased  as expected  on a revenue decrease of million  or 
the year reflected a decrease in domestic sales of million due to fewer titles released in the current year  reduced distribution outlets  the absence of a continuity series and a large sale of backlist titles in the prior year 
international revenue from dvd home video sales decreased million primarily due to the absence of revenues from a large korean contract  which were recorded in the prior year 
the group s administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher legal expenses related to the litigation with logix in the current year that were incurred prior to the settlement 
publishing group playboy magazine revenues increased million  or  for due to higher newsstand and advertising revenues 
newsstand revenues were million higher principally due to a increase in the number of us and canadian newsstand copies sold in the current year 
advertising revenues increased million  or  due to the sale of more ad pages  primarily from our th anniversary issue  combined with higher average net revenue per page 
advertising sales for the first quarter magazine issues are closed  and we expect to report more ad pages and higher ad revenues compared to the first quarter 
subscription revenues were essentially flat in compared to other domestic publishing revenues increased million  or  for compared to the prior year primarily due to higher revenues from sales of special editions resulting from the full year impact of the price increases  which more than offset a decline in average copies sold per issue 
the group s segment income nearly doubled from million in to million in partially offsetting the revenue increases stated above were higher magazine editorial costs due to celebrity pictorials and higher advertising and promotion costs related to the th anniversary issue  combined with the costs associated with moving playboy s editorial functions from chicago to new york 
in  we intend to capitalize on the momentum from the redesign of the magazine and the th anniversary with increased profitability for the group

online group online group revenues for increased million  or  to million 
subscription revenues represented the largest growth area  which increased million  or  due to growth in members  higher pricing of our various clubs  as well as the launch of new clubs 
e commerce revenues increased million  or  partly due to increased catalog circulation and improved marketing strategy for the spice catalog  combined with increased email campaigns and special offers for playboystore 
com 
other revenues were down million  or  primarily as a result of lower advertising revenues  partially caused by our decision to internally utilize the premium advertising space to drive traffic to our revenue generating sites 
the group s segment performance increased million mainly due to the higher revenues 
in accordance with an agreement  the group s results included trademark fees paid to the parent company of million in and the group will pay the same amount in we expect continued growth in profitability for the group in principally through anticipated growth of our subscription business with our current playboy and spice clubs as well as through affiliate and third party distribution deals  coupled with the increased use of broadband technology and continued profitable growth in e commerce 
licensing group segment income for from the licensing group increased million  or  on a revenue increase of million  or 
higher brand licensing royalties from our international and entertainment products businesses contributed to the revenue increase 
revenues from the th anniversary auctions of a portion of our collection of art  manuscripts  cartoons  photographs and memorabilia  and the earlier auction of an original painting by salvador dali  resulted in combined higher art revenues of million in compared to million in we intend to grow our royalty revenues in by expanding our product lines and distribution outlets  including the opening of additional retail stores through licensing arrangements  and continuing to partner with new companies to reach our targeted younger audience 
we do not expect significant art revenues in corporate administration and promotion corporate administration and promotion expenses for increased million  or

nonoperating income expenses in  we recorded total nonoperating expense of million compared to million in the prior year 
the most significant component was interest expense of million  a million increase from the prior year due primarily to an overall increase in our debt at a higher interest rate  partially offset by additional cash on our balance sheet as a result of the bond issuance

critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are the more complex and critical areas 
for additional information about our accounting policies  see note a summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition playboy magazine our playboy magazine revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  of which and were derived from newsstand sales in the respective year 
our print run  which is developed with input from warner  varies each month based on expected sales 
our expected sales are based on historical analyses of demand based on a number of variables  including content  time of year and the cover price 
we record our revenue for each month s issue utilizing our expected sales 
our revenues are recorded net of a provision for estimated returns 
substantially all of the magazines to be returned are returned within days of the date that the subsequent issue goes on sale 
we adjust our provision for returns based on actual returns of the magazine 
historically  our annual adjustments to playboy magazine newsstand revenues have not been material and are driven by differences in consumer demand as compared to expected sales 
at any point  our exposure to a material adjustment to revenue is mitigated because generally only the most recent two to three months would not have been fully adjusted to actual based on actual returns received 
domestic television our domestic television network revenue for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
in order to record our revenues  we estimate the number of ppv buys and monthly subscriptions 
we base our estimate of revenue on a number of factors including  but not exclusively  the average number of buys and subscriptions in the prior three months based on actual payments received and historical data by geographic location 
upon recording the revenue  we also record the related receivable 
we have reserves for uncollectible receivables based on our experience and monitor these reserves on an ongoing basis 
at december  and  we had receivables of million and million related to domestic television 
we record adjustments to revenue on a monthly basis as we obtain actual payments from the providers 
actual subscriber information and payment is generally received within three months 
historically  our adjustments have not been material 
at any point  our exposure to a material adjustment to revenue is mitigated because generally only the most recent two to three months would not have been fully adjusted to actual based on payments received 
trademarks our trademarks are critical to the success and potential growth of all of our businesses 
we actively protect and defend our trademarks throughout the world and monitor the marketplace for counterfeit products 
consequently  we initiate legal proceedings from time to time to prevent their unauthorized use  and we incur costs associated with acquisition  defense  registration and or renewal of our trademarks 
prior to the implementation of statement  goodwill and other intangible assets  in  trademark acquisition costs were capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over years  and trademark defense  registration and or renewal costs were capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over years 
beginning in  trademark related costs are no longer being amortized  since our trademarks have indefinite lives  but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the new accounting standard 
for periods after  capitalized amounts related to our trademarks are generally higher than they would have been had the old accounting standards continued to apply 
deferred revenues as of december   million and million of deferred revenues related to playboy magazine subscriptions and online subscriptions  respectively 
sales of playboy magazine and online subscriptions  less estimated cancellations  are deferred and recognized as revenues proportionately over the subscription period 
our estimates of cancellations are based on historical experience and current marketplace conditions and they are adjusted monthly on the basis of actual results 
we have not experienced significant deviations between estimated and actual results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to manage the risk associated with our exposure to such fluctuations  we enter into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we have derivative instruments that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  which are entered into in order to hedge the variability of cash flows to be received related to forecasted royalty revenues denominated in foreign currencies  primarily japanese yen and the euro 
we hedge these royalties with forward contracts for periods not exceeding months 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions 
we link all hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions 
we also assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items 
hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
effective with the refinancing of our financing obligations  which occurred on march   we no longer have any floating interest rate exposure 
all of our current debt is represented by the senior secured notes  which are fixed rate obligations 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that was scheduled to mature in may that effectively converted million of our floating rate debt to fixed rate debt  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
in march  in connection with the termination of our former credit facility  we also terminated this swap agreement for million 
we prepared sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of a hypothetical devaluation of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies of the countries to which we have exposure  primarily japan and germany 
based on our sensitivity analyses at december  and  such a change in foreign currency exchange rates would affect our annual consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows by approximately million for both periods
