safe harbor statement under the securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in our management s discussion and analysis are forward looking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results 
the words believes  expects  estimates  anticipates  will be  should and similar words or expressions identify forward looking statements made on behalf of caterpillar 
uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses  as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves 
world economic factors a worldwide economic recovery is now underway and further strengthening should occur this year 
economic growth is expected to exceed percent in  or about percentage point more than in low interest rates initiated economic recoveries and low inflation rates likely will encourage central bankers to be cautious about implementing any interest rate hikes 
if  however  central bankers decide to raise interest rates significantly  the recovery would be less robust than assumed  likely weakening machinery and engine sales 
page the us economy ended on a strong note and the continuation of low interest rates in should ensure a very good year for the economy 
we project us growth of at least percent and the canadian economy should rebound from s slowdown  growing more than percent in this environment should allow the recovery in machinery and engines sales that developed last year to strengthen further this year 
low interest rates  the tax cuts and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar have all helped the economy and our sales 
should any of these factors change substantially  such as a significant increase in interest rates  both economic growth and our sales probably would be weaker than assumed 
european economies recovered slowly in the last half of and current low interest rates should allow further strengthening this year 
we expect the european economies will grow percent in  fast enough to allow some improvement in construction activity 
favorable energy prices  plus much higher commodity prices  will promote another year of good economic growth in both africa middle east and the cis 
as a result  we project some improvement in eame sales in however  the european recovery is fragile and developments such as a much stronger euro or modest interest rate hikes could cause economic growth to falter 
in that case  the modest recovery in sales would be in jeopardy 
the japanese economy has grown for seven consecutive quarters and our outlook assumes that measures employed by the bank of japan zero interest rates  the maintenance of high levels of reserves in the banking system and the purchase of long term government bonds will allow this recovery to strengthen 
we project economic growth of percent in  up more than percentage point from and the best year since the economy remains vulnerable to any tightening in financial conditions and should that occur  the recovery could stall 
slower economic growth would further reduce our sales in that country and could have a negative impact on other economies  particularly those in the region 
our outlook assumes that the asia pacific region will again lead the world in economic growth  improving to over percent growth in we expect china s booming economy will slow a bit in response to modest tightening in economic policies  but better growth in most other countries will more than pick up the slack 
strong domestic economies and low local interest rates will boost construction and the region s sizeable mining sector will benefit from higher prices 
the principal risks that could disrupt economic growth and our sales are significant policy tightening in china and intensified trade frictions that slow exports from the region 
we expect latin american economic growth to improve to about percent in  much better than the percent rate experienced in we expect that the region will benefit from the worldwide economic recovery  reductions in local interest rates and a rebound in foreign direct investment inflows 
better economic growth should boost our sales  however  should the economic recovery not materialize as expected  our sales could continue to decline 
commodity prices commodities represent a significant sales opportunity  with prices and production as key drivers 
prices have improved sharply over production the past year and our outlook assumes continued growth in the world economy will cause metals prices to increase further in any unexpected weakening in world industrial production  however  could cause prices to drop sharply to the detriment of our results 
while coals stocks are high and prices have been soft  our outlook assumes production and prices will improve in if coal production and prices do not improve  our results could be negatively affected 
oil and natural gas prices have continued fairly high into due to strong demand and tight inventories 
our outlook assumes that increased production will ease shortages in both oil and natural gas  allowing prices to ease some 
we do not yet view higher energy prices as a threat to economies since it is strong demand that is boosting prices 
however  should significant supply cuts occur  such as from opec production cuts or political unrest in a major producing country  the resulting price spikes likely would slow economies  potentially with a depressing impact on our sales 
page monetary and fiscal policies for most companies operating in a global economy  monetary and fiscal policies implemented in the us and abroad could have a significant impact on economic growth  and accordingly  demand for a product 
in general  higher than expected interest rates  reductions in government spending  higher taxes  significant currency devaluations  and uncertainty over key policies are some factors likely to lead to slower economic growth and lower industry demand 
while economic data are looking more favorable  central banks in most developed countries are still holding interest rates steady 
two reserve bank of australia and bank of england have implemented modest interest rate increases 
our outlook assumes that central banks will take great care to ensure that economic recoveries continue and that interest rates will remain low throughout should central banks raise interest rates too aggressively  both economic growth and our sales could suffer 
budget deficits in many countries have increased  which has limited the ability of governments to boost economies with tax cuts and more spending 
our outlook assumes that governments will not aggressively raise taxes and slash spending to deal with their budget imbalances 
such actions could disrupt growth and negatively affect sales to public construction 
political factors political factors in the united states and abroad have a major impact on global companies 
our outlook assumes that there will be no significant military conflict in north korea or the middle east in the forecast period 
such a military conflict could severely disrupt sales into countries affected  as well as nearby countries 
our outlook also assumes that there will be no major terrorist attacks 
if there is a major terrorist attack  confidence could be undermined  causing a sharp drop in economic activities and our sales 
attacks in major developed economies would be the most disruptive 
our outlook further assumes that efforts by countries to increase their exports will not result in retaliatory countermeasures by other countries to block such exports  particularly in the asia pacific region 
currency fluctuations the company has costs and revenues in many currencies and is therefore exposed to risks arising from currency fluctuations 
many currency positions are fairly closely balanced  which  along with the diversity of currency positions  helps diminish exchange rate risks 
the company s largest manufacturing presence is in the united states 
so any unexpected strengthening of the dollar tends to raise the foreign currency value of costs and reduce our global competitiveness 
the stronger euro had a favorable impact on translating european sales into u 
s 
dollars for the full year 
the outlook assumes similar benefits in the future 
should the euro collapse  our results could be negatively impacted 
dealer practices the company sells primarily through an independent dealer network 
dealers carry inventories of both new and rental equipment and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs 
such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively 
the current outlook assumes dealers will reduce inventories slightly in  more drastic reductions would adversely affect sales 
other factors the rate of infrastructure spending  housing starts  commercial construction and mining play a significant role in the company s results 
our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease in the united states or abroad  demand for our products may be significantly impacted 
the us government is under pressure by the world trade organization to repeal extraterritorial eti income tax benefits 
our outlook assumes that if eti is repealed  we will not be materially impacted in due to the transition relief currently included in all bills under consideration by congress 
page pursuant to a consent decree caterpillar entered into with the epa  the company was required to meet certain emission standards by october the consent decree provided for the possibility that diesel engine manufacturers may not be able to meet these standards exactly on that date  and allows companies to continue selling non compliant engines if they pay ncps on those engines 
the company began shipping lower emission on highway engines in october as a bridge until the fully compliant acert engines were introduced in these bridge engines required the payment of ncps 
at year end  caterpillar was in production of all models of its medium heavy duty and heavy duty compliant acert engines 
therefore  our outlook for assumes that we will not pay ncps beyond our outlook is also subject to assumptions regarding price increases and sales volumes 
our net price increase for heavy duty on highway bridge engines was successfully implemented on october   this increase was competitive with price increases implemented by other engine manufacturers on that date 
we implemented an additional price increase in to truck manufacturers that purchase our heavy duty acert engines and implemented a price increase on january   for medium heavy duty acert engines 
these increases are based on the additional value that we expect truck owners to receive from acert engines compared to our competitors as a result of better fuel economy  less maintenance and greater durability 
the ultimate net price increase we are able to achieve for our acert engines is dependent upon marketplace acceptance of these engines versus competitive alternatives 
while we estimate volume to the best of our ability  industry volume is an issue out of our control 
if our assumptions regarding ncps  market acceptance of the price increases and or engine volume are not realized  company performance could be negatively impacted 
projected cost savings or synergies from alliances with new partners could also be negatively impacted by a variety of factors 
these factors could include  among other things  higher than expected wages  energy and or material costs  and or higher than expected financing costs due to unforeseen changes in tax  trade  environmental  labor  safety  payroll or pension policies in any of the jurisdictions where the alliances conduct their operations 
results may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix 
our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales 
if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales  our results could be negatively impacted 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the company s share of industry sales 
an unexpected reduction in that share could result from pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors  unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties  a failure to price the product competitively  or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer owned rental fleets  leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and or used equipment prices 
the environment also remains very competitive from a pricing standpoint 
additional price discounting would result in lower than anticipated price realization 
inherent in the operation of the financial products division is the credit risk associated with its customers 
the creditworthiness of each customer  and the rate of delinquencies  repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors  including  but not limited to  relevant industry and economic conditions  the availability of capital  the experience and expertise of the customer s management team  commodity prices  political events  and the sustained value of the underlying collateral 
additionally  interest rate movements create a degree of risk to our operations by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed rate debt 
our match funding policy manages interest rate risk by matching the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio within certain parameters 
to achieve our match funding objectives  we issue debt with similar interest rate profile to our receivables and also use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower our cost of borrowed funds 
if interest rates move upward more sharply than anticipated  our financial results could be negatively impacted 
with respect to our insurance and investment management operations  changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of our investment portfolio  thus requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 
page in general  our results are sensitive to changes in economic growth  particularly those originating in construction  mining and energy 
developments reducing such activities also tend to lower our sales 
in addition to the factors mentioned above  our results could be negatively impacted by any of the following any sudden drop in consumer or business confidence delays in legislation needed to fund public construction regulatory or legislative changes that slow activity in key industries  and or unexpected collapses in stock markets 
this discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook 
obvious factors such as general economic conditions throughout the world do not warrant further discussion  but are noted to further emphasize the myriad of contingencies that may cause the company s actual results to differ from those currently anticipated
