the increase in allowance in fiscal was primarily due to the overall business environment of our customers 
no particular customer was a cause of the changes in allowances 
we had no significant changes in our collection policies or payment terms impairment of long lived assets the company reviews assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
a determination of impairment is made based on estimates of future cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment is based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the assets 
goodwill and purchased intangibles with indefinite lives are reviewed annually for impairment 
a determination of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the reporting entity 
impairment of marketable securities available for sale an impairment charge is recorded if a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost is deemed to be other than temporary 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
the company considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
to the extent a deferred tax asset cannot be recognized under the preceding criteria  a valuation allowance is established 
the judgments used in applying the above policies are based on management s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements
