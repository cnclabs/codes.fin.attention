a significant portion of the company s revenues is derived from licensing the rights to use its fax software products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers 
the company resells  from third party vendors  certain hardware products  including intelligent fax boards and fax modems  to its customers 
hardware sales are undertaken as a convenience to the company s customers and hardware is not required to be purchased from the company and can be alternatively obtained from a third party vendor 
the fax boards and fax modems that are resold are not functional without the company s software and the company is not in the business of selling fax boards and modems 
the company purchases these hardware products as needed to ship to its customers and the company maintains a minimal inventory of these hardware products 
management believes that it has a good business relationship with suppliers of these products and that supply of these products is stable 
service and other revenues have consisted primarily of the sale of support contracts 
revenue from support contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract period 
the company generates a smaller portion of its service and other revenues from consulting  training and installation services 
the company s financial results for improved from as the net loss was reduced from million in to million in the company also recorded a net profit of  for the quarter ended december  quarterly revenue for the last three quarters of was higher than it was for the same three quarters of however  annual revenue for was lower than it was for due to a weak first quarter in the company s revenue however has grown in each subsequent quarter 
the company believes that there has been some improvement in the demand for enterprise software solutions over this period which has led to an increase in information technology spending 
the sales growth the company has been experiencing in the last three quarters of is a result of a steady improvement of sales transactions over the same time period 
the current expected level of sales transactions and resulting revenues for combined with lower annual expenses resulting from the third quarter of restructuring charge leads management to believe that its results of operations will be better in each quarter in than in the comparable quarter of however  this expectation is subject to change if the current economic environment changes and the general softness in information technology spending returns or if the company s products do not achieve market acceptance 
as a result of the losses incurred in the first three quarters of  the company reduced its work force and office space in september to lower the overall cost of operations 
although the company s operating cash flow for the year ended december  resulted in a use of cash of million  the company s cash and cash equivalents at december  were approximately million 
as such  the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next year 
although the company believes that recently there has been some improvement in the demand for enterprise software solutions  it cannot predict when that market will change 
when the market does change  the company cannot predict whether  and to what extent  the demand for its products will increase or decrease 
any decrease in demand for the company s products would most likely result in decreased revenue which would in turn have a significant impact on the company s financial results  particularly because a significant portion of the company s operating costs such as personnel  rent and depreciation are fixed in advance of a particular quarter 
as a result  despite cost savings realized from the company s september restructuring  the company s costs for sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative could continue to increase as a percentage of revenues  thereby affecting the company s operating results 
the company s future revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the number and size of sales transactions the company enters into with customers  the adequacy of provisions for losses  general economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  revenues from a large order may constitute a significant portion of the company s total revenues in a particular quarter 
the company has historically derived a majority of its total revenues from sales within north america 
sales outside of north america primarily in europe represented approximately  and of the company s total revenues in  and  respectively 
the company s gross profit on these sales approximates the gross profit on sales within north america 
the company s strategy is to expand its international presence primarily in europe and to increase its investment in sales and marketing efforts directed toward international markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international sales of its products  and the failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s united kingdom subsidiary transacts business primarily in its local currency 
the company manages its foreign exchange exposure by monitoring its net monetary position using natural hedges of its assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies 
there can be no assurance that this policy will eliminate all currency exposure 
foreign currency exposure has not been material to the company s financial position or results of operations to date 
if the company s business denominated in foreign currencies increases  the company may be required to use derivatives to hedge foreign currency exposure 
the company will continue to leverage its existing distribution channels where appropriate to broaden its reach to the target vertical markets and further penetrate its installed base 
the company is pursuing sales opportunities via its solution reseller channel as well as focusing sales efforts on specific market segments in order to facilitate product acceptance 
sales through the company s indirect distribution channels represent approximately  and of the company s total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has identified the policies and estimates below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
note that the company s preparation of this form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable reserves 
the company derives its revenue from primarily two sources i product revenue  which includes software license and hardware revenue and ii services and support revenue  which includes software maintenance and support  installation  training and consulting revenue 
the company licenses its software products on a perpetual basis 
the company generates revenue from licensing the rights to use its software products and sales of hardware directly to end users and indirectly through resellers 
the company s resellers order products from the company based on purchase orders received from end users and do not order stock 
the company s products are sold to resellers and directly to end users without any specifically stated rights of return 
occasionally  however  the company  at its sole discretion  will accept a product return if the end user finds that the product does not fit its needs 
the company also sells hardware products  which are provided by a third party  on a pass through basis  plus an additional mark up  to end users and indirectly through resellers 
the hardware products that are resold are not functional without the company s software 
to support its software products  the company sells software maintenance and support  installation  training and consulting services to end users and indirectly through resellers 
the company applies the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of multiple elements including software  hardware and service revenue 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  with respect to providing for potential future product returns 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of the company s revenue if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software products and hardware to both end users and resellers when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products have been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and there are no customer acceptance provisions 
the company maintains a reserve for potential product returns 
software maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the related maintenance period 
typically this is a one year period  but occasionally the company sells multiple year maintenance contracts in which case  the associated revenue is recognized over the multiple year term of the contract 
other services revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  the company will defer all revenue until the customer accepts the products 
acceptance generally occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
the company s transactions frequently involve the sales of software  hardware and related services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated to each element under the residual method  in accordance with sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under this method  revenue is allocated first to all undelivered elements  such as services  based on the fair value of those elements  which is the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by other elements 
the company s services are not essential to the functionality of the software as these services do not alter the capabilities of the software and do not carry a significant degree of risk to perform 
the amount allocated to the delivered elements  such as software license and hardware revenue  is the difference between the total arrangement value and the amount allocated to the undelivered elements 
if the delivered elements include both software and hardware  the amount allocated to hardware revenue is based on the price charged to the company by the third party vendor plus an additional mark up  with the remainder allocated to software revenue 
to the extent that a discount is offered in the arrangement  the entire discount is allocated to the delivered element or elements 
if the delivered elements include hardware and software  the discount is allocated to the hardware and software based on their respective list prices 
for all sales  the company uses a binding purchase order  a signed contract or a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through the company s resellers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders  on a transaction by transaction basis 
at the time of the transaction  the company assesses whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
if a significant portion of a fee is due beyond the company s normal payment terms  which are thirty to sixty days from invoice date  the company accounts for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  the company recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
the company assesses collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company reviews d b credit reports for all of its resellers and adjusts its credit limits with those resellers accordingly 
if the reseller does not have a favorable report or the company does not have enough credit information to distinguish if the reseller is credit worthy then the company predominantly sells to such resellers on cod terms 
the company does not request collateral from its customers 
if the company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
the company reserves for potential product returns and makes adjustments to the reserve as needed  based on historical product return rates  and considers the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand and acceptance of the company s products 
management s calculation of the estimated return reserve is based upon an account specific review of potential returns  where a return probability is known  and a general estimate based upon past historical returns as a percentage of revenue 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns reserve in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
similarly  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of the company s accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management s calculation of the estimated accounts receivable reserve is based upon an account specific review of potential uncollectible accounts  where a bad debt probability is known  and a general estimate based upon past historical bad debts as a percentage of accounts receivable 
the company s combined accounts receivable and returns reserve was approximately  and  at december   and  respectively 
both components of calculating the estimated reserve  specific identification and historic experience  are material judgments 
these judgments are based on historic trends  taking into consideration current business and economic conditions  which could change materially  thus changing the required reserve level materially 
the potential change could be positive  in the event the reserve estimate proves unnecessary  or negative  if the reserve proves inadequate 
the company s deferred revenue is comprised mainly of revenue that is deferred for software maintenance and support contracts 
the other components of deferred revenue are the amounts from sales transactions that were deferred because they did not meet all of the provisions of the company s revenue recognition policy 
software development costs 
software development costs are considered for capitalization when technological feasibility is established in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the company sells software in a market that is subject to rapid technological change  new product introductions and changing customer needs 
accordingly  the company has determined that it cannot determine technological feasibility until the development state of the product is nearly complete 
the time period during which cost could be capitalized from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very short and  consequently  the amounts that might be capitalized are not material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
therefore  the company charges all software development costs to operations in the period incurred 
taxes 
the company is required to estimate its income and state sales taxes 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax obligations together with assessing differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities and accrued state sales tax liabilities 
the company has deferred income tax assets and liabilities and accrued state sales tax liabilities included within its balance sheet 
the company s deferred tax assets are assessed for each reporting period as to whether it is more likely than not that they will be recovered from future taxable income  including assumptions regarding on going tax planning strategies 
to the extent the company believes that recovery is uncertain  the company must establish a valuation allowance for assets not expected to be recovered 
changes to the valuation allowance are included as an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
during the quarter ended june   the company recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately million against all of its net deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires a valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of the downturn in the economy  the company incurred significant and previously unanticipated losses in the first half of  and the outlook indicated that significant uncertainty would continue into these cumulative losses  together with the company s prior losses  resulted in management s decision that it was more likely than not that all of its deferred tax assets would not be realized in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  the remaining net deferred tax asset was written off in the second quarter of significant judgment was involved in management s decision to write off its net deferred tax assets 
if management had concluded differently  the company s net loss for the year ended december  would have been materially different 
the company will continue to provide a valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax assets until it returns to an appropriate level of taxable income 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets depends upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
if the company is successful in generating sufficient future taxable income  the company will reduce the valuation allowance through a reduction in income tax expense in the future 
accrued state sales taxes are estimated for each reporting period based on tax rates in effect for the reporting periods in each of the states where the company has potential nexus and the time period that the company has nexus 
the assumptions and estimates used to determine this liability are subject to change as they are difficult to measure or value 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the company s state sales taxes expense could be materially impacted

the increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues is due to decreased revenue combined with an increase in state sales tax accruals for the year 
the company expects general and administrative expenses are likely to decrease in absolute dollars 
interest and other income 
interest and other income consists principally of interest income earned on excess cash 
interest and other income was  for the fiscal year ended december  and  for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease of is due to changes in principal balances and lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the company recorded a provision of million against the valuation of its net deferred tax asset during the year ended december  sfas no 
requires a valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of the downturn in the economy  the company incurred significant and previously unanticipated losses in the first half of the  and the outlook indicated that significant uncertainty would continue into the next fiscal year 
these cumulative losses  together with the company s prior losses  resulted in management s decision that it was more likely than not that all of its deferred tax assets would not be realized in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  the remaining deferred tax asset of million was written off in the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources since  the company has financed its operations primarily through cash flow from operations  the private sales of preferred stock and the company s initial public offering of common stock completed in august at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company s operating activities used cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
management restructured the organization in september to reduce operating expense and help preserve cash 
management believes that these reductions  which are anticipated to total approximately million annually  along with the revenue assumptions used for the company s budget will lead to sufficient cash for at least the next twelve months 
net cash used during the year ended december  consisted primarily of a net loss from operations and decreases to the accounts receivable reserve  accrued state sales tax  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the decrease in the accounts receivable reserve is due to the release of reserves relating to specific accounts where the risk of a return is no longer considered to be present 
the decrease in accounts payable is due to the timing of vendor payments 
the decrease to accrued state sales tax is due to payments made to settle taxes due to certain states during the year 
the company expects to continue to settle state sales taxes with other states in but cannot predict with any certainty the overall negative effect this might have on cash 
the decrease to the accrued liabilities is due to the timing of the company s year end payroll and to a reduction in accrued professional fees 
the uses of cash were offset by the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization  along with decreases to accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and inventory and an increase in accrued restructuring 
the decrease in accounts receivable is due to management s increased focus on improving working capital by decreasing days sales outstanding 
net cash used during the year ended december  consisted primarily of a net loss from operations and a decrease to accrued liabilities due to timing of the company s year end payroll and fewer accruals for bonuses in than in this was offset by a write off of the deferred tax asset as discussed in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements  depreciation and amortization  an increase in accrued state sale tax and accounts payable and decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid and other current assets 
investing activities provided cash of million and used cash of  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash proceeds in were from the sale of short term investments offset by the purchases of short term investments and purchases of property  plant and equipment 
the company s investments are professionally managed and the company has instructed its broker to earn the highest interest rate possible for low risk securities 
the company s broker primarily purchases cash equivalent securities but may  on occasion  purchase short term investments 
property and equipment purchases were predominately of computer related software and hardware products 
the principal uses in were purchases of short term investments and property and equipment  offset by proceeds from the sale of short term investments 
financing activities provided cash of  and used cash of  during the years ended december  and cash provided by financing activities in consists of proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock for stock option exercises 
cash used by financing activities in is due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock for stock option exercises offset by the purchases of treasury stock 
based on its fourth quarter performance and current expectations  the company believes that the cash  cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will satisfy its working capital needs  capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with its operations through at least the next twelve months 
the company expects that principal uses of cash will be for operations  working capital  payment of sales taxes and purchases of property and equipment 
management currently has no plan to obtain additional financing if these expectations are not met 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the following table represents the approximate amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating lease obligations   total obligations   operating lease requirements consist mainly of lease payments for the company s offices in salem  new hampshire and london  england see item  properties  of this form k for more information regarding the company s leases 
as of december   the company did not have any long term debt obligations  capital lease obligations  or other long term liabilities for which payments are required 
certain factors affecting future operating results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results 
information provided by the company from time to time including statements in this form k which are not historical facts are so called forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in particular  statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning the plans and objectives of management  expectations for sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses  developments relating to the company s product and service offerings  markets and acquisitions  anticipated trends in the company s business  the company s strategic alliances  changes in the regulatory environment  the company s expected liquidity and capital resources and the company s critical accounting policies may constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees  but are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations set forth in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below  and the other risks discussed from time to time in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
future operating results uncertain 
the company incorporated and shipped its initial facsimile software products in in the years ending december   and  the company had operating losses and decreasing revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its level of revenues or return to profitability in the future  as the company s operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
increases in operating expenses may occur and  together with pricing pressures and a decline in the growth rate of the overall us economy  may result in a continued decrease in operating income and operating margin percentage 
the company s ability to improve its operating results will depend upon  among other things  its ability to increase sales of the accuroute  genifax and genidoc software products to new customers as well as increased product penetration into existing customers 
the company recently commenced its strategic expansion into document routing and distribution software  and has limited financial and operating data and a limited operating history relevant to this solution 
accordingly  it is difficult to evaluate the prospects for the level of acceptance of this solution 
future operating results will depend on many other factors  including  without limitation  the degree and rate of growth of the markets in which the company competes  the level of acceptance of the windows nt  windows and windows xp operating systems  the level of product and price competition  the ability of the company to establish strategic relationships and develop and market new and enhanced products and to control costs  the ability of the company to expand its direct sales force and indirect distribution channels both domestically and internationally and the ability of the company to attract and retain key personnel 
as a result  it is possible that in the future the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
product concentration 
to date  much of the company s revenues have been attributable to licenses of the company s facsimile based enterprise solutions and related products and services 
the company expects such products and related services to continue to account for much of the company s future revenues 
however  recently the amount of revenues attributable to the licenses of such products has declined and there can be no assurances that such decline will not continue 
furthermore  the company introduced its secure business to business electronic document exchange products  genidocs and genifax  to the market in the fourth quarter of and it introduced its proprietary document and routing software  accuroute  in the second quarter of to date  the company has not recognized a significant amount of revenues from its genidocs and accuroute products 
the company expects that its genidocs and accuroute products may account for an increasing portion of future revenues 
however  there can be no assurances that the genidocs and accuroute products will be financially successful or result in any significant revenues 
factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for such products  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies dependent upon operating revenues from a new product line in an emerging and rapidly evolving market 
new products and technological change 
the markets for the company s products are relatively new and are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and respond to evolving end user requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product enhancements on a timely basis  or that new products or product enhancements developed by the company  such as the genidocs  genifax and accuroute products will achieve market acceptance 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
from time to time  the company and its competitors may announce new products  capabilities or technologies that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing product offerings 
there can be no assurance that announcements of new product offerings by the company or its competitors will not cause customers to defer or forego the licensing of the company s existing or planned products and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market risks for secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions 
the market for genidocs  the company s secure business to business electronic document exchange solution is new and evolving rapidly 
the company s success will depend upon the adoption and use by current and potential customers of secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions 
the company s success will also depend upon acceptance of its technology as the standard for providing these solutions 
the adoption and use of the company s secure business to business electronic document exchange solution will involve changes in the manner in which businesses have traditionally exchanged information 
the company s ability to influence usage of its secure business to business electronic document exchange solution by customers is limited 
the company intends to spend considerable resources educating potential customers about the value of secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions 
it is difficult to assess  or to predict with any assurance  the present and future size of the potential market for the company s secure business to business electronic document exchange solution  or its growth rate  if any 
moreover  the company cannot predict whether the company s secure business to business electronic document exchange solution will achieve any market acceptance 
any future products or future product enhancements that are not favorably received by customers may not be profitable and  furthermore  could damage the company s reputation or brand name 
dependence on genifax product line and the windows xp environment 
the company currently derives a significant portion of its revenues from licenses of the genifax product and related services and resale of related hardware 
continued market acceptance of the genifax product is critical to the company s future success 
as a result  any decline in demand for or failure to maintain broad market acceptance of the genifax product line as a result of competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future financial performance will depend in large part on new and enhanced versions of the genifax product 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in marketing the genifax product or any new or enhanced versions of the genifax product 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing products for new or enhanced operating systems such as windows or windows xp  or that such systems will not obviate the need for the company s products 
if any new or enhanced operating system gains widespread use and the company fails to develop and provide its products for this operating system on a timely basis  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on client server environment 
the company s enterprise  client server facsimile software products are intended to help organizations efficiently manage their facsimile communications  utilizing a client server computing environment 
the client server market is relatively new and there can be no assurance that organizations will move away from the use of stand alone fax machines or continue to adopt client server environments  or that customers of the company that have begun the migration to a client server environment will broadly implement this model of computing 
the company s future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the market for client server applications  which in turn will depend in part on the growth in the number of organizations implementing client server computing environments 
there can be no assurance that these markets will continue to grow or that the company will be able to respond effectively to the evolving requirements of these markets 
if the market for client server application products and services does not grow in the future  grows more slowly than the company anticipates  or if the company fails to respond effectively to evolving requirements of this market  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
risks associated with listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in august  the nasdaq national market nasdaq informed the company that its common stock had traded for consecutive trading days below the minimum bid price and that the company had until november   to demonstrate compliance with nasdaq s listing requirements by maintaining a bid price for its common stock of at least for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days 
the company did not regain compliance and on october   the company applied to transfer from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
on november   the company transferred to the nasdaq smallcap market and it was afforded the remainder of this market s calendar day grace period  or until february   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price per share requirement 
on january   omtool s board of directors voted a one for seven stock split of the company s common stock effective january  pursuant to a special meeting of stockholders that was held on the same day approving an amendment to the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the company to effect a reverse stock split 
on february   the company was notified by nasdaq that it had regained compliance 
the company cannot predict the impact  if any  of a change in listing to the smallcap market 
in addition  the company cannot predict the continuance of its listing status in the future including the possibility of delisting from the nasdaq small cap market 
the delisting of the company s common stock from nasdaq may materially impair the stockholder s ability to buy and sell shares of the company s common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of  and the efficiency of the trading market for  the company s common stock 
furthermore  the delisting of the company s common stock could significantly impair the company s ability to raise capital should it desire to do so in the future 
intense competition 
the document routing and distribution software  secure business to business electronic document exchange solution and enterprise  client server facsimile solution markets are intensely competitive and rapidly changing and the company expects competition to continue to increase 
the company believes its ability to compete successfully depends upon a number of factors both within and beyond its control  including product performance  reliability and features  product adoption  ease of use  product scalability  quality of support services  price performance  timeliness of enhancements and new product releases by the company and its competitors  the emergence of new computer based facsimile and secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions and standards  name recognition  the establishment of strategic alliances with industry leaders and industry and general economic trends 
the company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors in the secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions market  and the competitive pressures the company faces could harm its business and prospects 
in the intensely competitive and rapidly changing business to business secure document exchange market  the company competes directly with authentica  sigaba  tumbleweed  and zixit and a number of other providers 
there are also other categories of technology solution that overlap and compete in certain ways with aspects of the company s products 
these include document management solutions from vendors such as documentum  hummingbird and imanage whose electronic collaboration solutions compete with certain aspects of the company s solutions  electronic forms and electronic signature solutions from vendors such as adobe  pureedge  createform and silanis that offer the creation of electronic documents with electronic signatures  and security infrastructure solutions from vendors such as verisign and entrust whose solutions can be used to build applications that enable secure document communications 
the company expects the competition in the business to business secure document exchange market to increase over time 
the company competes directly with a large number of vendors of facsimile products  including providers of facsimile software products for client server networks such as rightfax a subsidiary of captaris  fenestrae  topcall international and biscom 
the company also competes with providers offering a range of alternative facsimile solutions including outsourcing network facsimile solutions  such as easylink services  operating systems containing facsimile and document e mail features  low end fax modem products  providers of desktop fax software  single platform facsimile software products  and customized proprietary software solutions 
in addition  providers of operating systems or business software applications may bundle competitive facsimile solutions as part of their broader product offerings 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and market acceptance of their products and technologies than the company 
in addition  there are relatively low barriers to entry in the markets in which the company operates and intends to operate  and new competition may arise either from expansion by established companies or from new emerging companies or from resellers of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that current or potential competitors of the company will not develop products comparable or superior in terms of price and performance features to those developed by the company  adapt more quickly than the company to new or emerging technologies and changes in market opportunities or customer requirements  establish alliances with industry leaders  or take advantage of acquisition opportunities more readily than the company 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the company will not be required to make substantial additional investments in connection with its research  development  engineering  marketing  sales and customer service efforts in order to meet any competitive threat  or that such required investments will not have a material adverse effect on operating margins 
changes in government laws and regulations may also affect our ability to maintain competitiveness 
increased competition may result in reduction in market share  pressure for price reductions and related reductions in gross margins  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s ability to achieve its financial and business goals 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations  seasonality 
the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely fluctuate significantly in the future 
causes of such fluctuations have included and may include  among others  the demand for the company s products and services  the size and timing of orders  the number  timing and significance of new product announcements by the company and its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  introduce  market and ship new and enhanced versions of the company s current and planned products on a timely basis  the level of product and price competition  changes in operating expenses  changes in average selling prices and mix of the company s products  changes in the company s sales incentive strategy  the mix of direct and indirect sales  and general economic factors  including a continued decline in the growth rate of the overall us economy 
in addition  the sale of the company s products often involves delays because customers tend to implement the products on a large scale and they also must establish certain minimum hardware capabilities 
the company s products therefore often have a lengthy sales cycle while the customer evaluates and receives approvals for the purchase of the company s products 
during such sales cycles  the company may expend substantial funds and management efforts yet receive no revenues 
it is difficult to accurately predict the sales cycle of any large order 
if one or more large orders fail to close as forecasted in a fiscal quarter  the company s revenues and operating results for such quarter could be materially adversely affected 
any one or more of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the potential occurrence of any one or more of these factors makes the prediction of revenues and results of operations on a quarterly basis difficult and performance forecasts derived from such predictions unreliable 
in general  revenues are difficult to forecast because the market for secure business to business electronic document exchange  enterprise client server facsimile solutions software and routing and distribution software is evolving rapidly and the company s sales cycle from the customer s initial evaluation through purchase of licenses and the related support services varies substantially from customer to customer 
license fee revenues in any quarter depend on orders received and shipped in that quarter with an increasing percentage of orders in any quarter being received in the last weeks of the quarter 
license fee revenues from quarter to quarter are difficult to forecast  as no significant order backlog exists at the end of any quarter because the company s products typically are shipped upon receipt of customers orders 
a substantial portion of the company s operating expense is related to personnel  facilities  equipment and marketing programs 
the level of spending for such expense cannot be adjusted quickly and is therefore fixed in the short term 
the company s expense levels for personnel  facilities  equipment and marketing programs are based  in significant part  on the company s expectations of future revenues on a quarterly basis 
if actual revenue levels on a quarterly basis are below management s expectations  results of operations are likely to be adversely affected by a similar amount because a relatively small amount of the company s expense varies with its revenue in the short term 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future periods the company s results of operations will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
expansion of indirect channels  potential for channel conflict  strategic alliances 
the company markets its products and services directly through telesales and indirectly through marketing channels such as value added resellers vars  systems integrators  distributors and strategic business partners 
although the company has historically focused its efforts on marketing through its sales force  the company continues to utilize resources to develop and expand indirect marketing channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified vars  systems integrators  distributors and strategic business partners to successfully market the company s products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s resellers and strategic business partners will not develop  acquire or market computer based facsimile products that are competitive with the company s products 
the failure to retain its vars  systems integrators  distributors and strategic partners could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the distributor agreements generally provide that either party may terminate the agreement without cause upon days written notice to the other party 
the company also resells its products on a purchase order basis through other vars  systems integrators and distributors 
either party may terminate such relationships  at any time  and therefore there can be no assurance that any var  systems integrator or distributor will continue to represent the company s products 
furthermore  the company s strategic alliances may be terminated by either party  at any time  there can be no assurances that such strategic alliances will continue 
the inability to retain certain vars  systems integrators  distributors or strategic business partners  or the development or marketing by vars  systems integrators  distributors or strategic business partners of competitive offerings  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
selling through indirect channels may limit the company s contacts with its customers 
as a result  the company s ability to accurately forecast sales  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered 
the company s strategy of marketing its products directly to end users and indirectly through vars  systems integrators and distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts 
the company s direct sales efforts may compete with those of its indirect channels and  to the extent different resellers target the same customers  resellers may also come into conflict with each other 
as the company strives to expand its indirect distribution channels  there can be no assurance that emerging channel conflicts will not materially adversely affect its relationships with existing vars  systems integrators or distributors or adversely affect its ability to attract new vars  systems integrators and distributors 
ability to obtain additional financing 
we expect our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will meet our normal working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to raise additional funding at that time or earlier if we decide to undertake more rapid expansion  including acquisitions of complementary products or technologies  or if we increase our marketing and or research and development efforts in order to respond to competitive pressures 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we may obtain additional financing by issuing shares of our common stock  which could dilute our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  or at all  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products or respond appropriately to competitive pressures  which would seriously harm our business 
risks associated with acquisitions 
the company may augment its internal growth with acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that could complement or expand the company s business 
certain of these businesses may be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
in order to achieve anticipated benefits from these acquisitions  the company must successfully integrate the acquired businesses with its existing operations and no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in this regard 
the company has limited experience in integrating acquired companies into its operations  in expanding the scope of operations of required businesses  in managing geographically dispersed operations and in operating internationally 
in the past the company has incurred one time costs and expenses in connection with acquisitions and it is likely that similar one time costs and expenses would be incurred in connection with future acquisitions 
in addition  attractive acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including competition among prospective buyers and the possible need to obtain regulatory approval 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete future acquisitions 
in order to finance such acquisitions  it may be necessary for the company to raise additional funds either through public or private financings  including bank borrowings 
any financing  if available at all  may be on terms which are not favorable to the company 
the company may also issue shares of its common stock to acquire such businesses  which may dilute the company s existing stockholders 
ability to manage growth 
the company may expand its operations and anticipates that expansion may be required in order to address potential market opportunities 
the company may increase the size of its sales and marketing and research and development expenditures as necessary 
there can be no assurance that such expansion would be completed successfully or that it would generate sufficient revenues to cover the company s expenses 
the company will need to continue to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain or continue to hire such personnel in the future 
the inability of the company to effectively expand operations and manage growth  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with the use of arthur andersen as independent auditors 
arthur andersen llp andersen  the company s former independent public accountants that audited the company s financial statements until june   was found guilty by a jury on june  of federal obstruction of justice in connection with the government s investigation of enron corporation 
andersen ceased practicing before the sec effective august  although the company has no reason to believe that those financial statements are incorrect  it is possible that events arising out of the indictment may adversely affect andersen s ability to satisfy any claims arising from its provision of auditing and other services to the company  including claims that may arise out of andersen s audit of the company s financial statements 
the sec has indicated that it will continue accepting financial statements audited or reviewed by andersen provided that the company comply with the applicable rules and orders issued by the sec in march for such purpose 
risks associated with international expansion 
an element of the company s strategy is to increase its international sales 
the company expects to face competition from secure business to business electronic document exchange solutions and local facsimile product providers in their native countries 
to successfully maintain international sales  the company needs to recruit and retain additional international resellers and distributors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain international sales of its products or that the company s international distribution channels will be able to adequately market  service and support the company s products 
international operations generally are subject to certain risks  including dependence on independent resellers  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements  variability of foreign economic conditions and changing restrictions imposed by united states export laws 
additional risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the company has a sales office outside of the united states  such operations are subject to certain additional risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing such operations and potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  a majority of the company s sales have been made in united states dollars and the company has not engaged in any hedging transactions through the purchase of derivative securities or otherwise 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future performance depends  in significant part  upon the continued service of its key technical  sales and senior management personnel  most of who are not bound by an employment agreement or by a noncompetition agreement 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and the company has experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified technical personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain or continue to hire key technical  sales and managerial personnel in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments as of december   the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required 
all of the company s investments consist of money market funds and commercial paper that are carried on the company s books at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s current investment portfolio of cash equivalents is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of its united kingdom subsidiary are almost exclusively conducted in its local currency 
the united kingdom subsidiary operating results are translated into us dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on intercompany transactions was immaterial for the year ended december  currently  the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
