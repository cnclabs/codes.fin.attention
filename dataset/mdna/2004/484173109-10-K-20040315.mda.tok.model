off balance sheet transactions the company was not a party of any off balance sheet transactions at december   or for any of the years ended december   and critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal to the company s financial position and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s most critical accounting policies pertain to impairment of property and equipment and environmental costs 
the carrying value of kpp s property and equipment is periodically evaluated using management s estimates of undiscounted future cash flows  or  in some cases  third party appraisals  as the basis of determining if impairment exists under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or the disposal of long lived assets  which was adopted effective january  to the extent that impairment is indicated to exist  an impairment loss is recognized by kpp under sfas no 
based on fair value 
the application of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the results of operations of kpp for the years ended december  or however  future evaluations of carrying value are dependent on many factors  several of which are out of kpp s control  including demand for refined petroleum products and terminaling services in kpp s market areas  and local  state and federal governmental regulations 
to the extent that such factors or conditions change  it is possible that future impairments might occur  which could have a material effect on the results of operations of kpp 
kpp environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations  and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation  are expensed 
liabilities are recorded by kpp when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable  and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
generally  the timing of these accruals coincides with the completion of a feasibility study or kpp s commitment to a formal plan of action 
the application of kpp s environmental accounting policies did not have a material impact on the results of operations of kpp for the years ended december   or although kpp believes that its operations are in general compliance with applicable environmental regulations  risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline and terminaling operations 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  and legal claims for damages to property or persons resulting from the operations of kpp could result in substantial costs and liabilities  any of which could have a material effect on the results of operations of kpp
