executive summary the company  through its wholly owned bank subsidiary  operates a single line of business encompassing general retail and commercial banking business primarily in the chicago metropolitan area 
the company is located in a highly competitive market  facing competition for banking and related financial services from many financial intermediaries 
competition amongst financial intermediaries is generally expressed in terms of interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits  the price of products and services a bank can offer and the variety of financial services offered 
the company offers a full range of banking services such as demand  savings and time deposits  corporate treasury management services  merchant credit card processing  commercial lending products and personal lending products 
the company also maintains a full service investment management and trust department  and in  formed an investment sales division to execute customer investment transactions in us treasury  us government agency  corporate and municipal securities primarily for commercial businesses  not for profit organizations  governmental entities and high net worth families 
the profitability of the company s operations depends on net interest income  provision for loan losses  noninterest income  and noninterest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of interest earning assets as compared to the amounts and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of the company s asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio  management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  loss experience  as well as economic and market factors 
noninterest income consists primarily of treasury management  merchant and trust fee income  and to a lesser extent  fees for ancillary banking services 
noninterest expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of internal operations 
the company s growth directly affects the majority of the company s expense categories 
the company opened three new branches in fiscal year  one each in countryside  graue mill and st 
charles  which added new deposits and increased noninterest expenses 
the company s primary growth strategy continues to revolve around the expansion of branch locations in the chicago metropolitan area while maintaining a strong capital position to enhance the confidence of our customers  shareholders and banking regulators

see results of operations for further explanation of the company s performance 
application of critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience  projected results and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
the company believes the policies that govern the allowance for loan losses and the deferred tax assets and liabilities are critical accounting policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents allowance for loan losses management of the bank prepares a detailed analysis  at least quarterly  reviewing the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses and  when appropriate  recommends an increase or decrease in its provision for loan losses 
the quarterly analysis is divided into two segments the allocated portion for specific loans and loan categories and the unallocated portion which is not specifically related to any specific segment of the portfolio 
the analysis to determine the allocated portion of the allowance is again divided into two parts 
the first part involves primarily an estimated calculation of losses on loans on the management watch list 
the company s management watch list includes all nonaccrual loans  commercial nonperforming loans and potential problem loans and related commitments 
although the management watch list includes the company s property in oreo  this asset is reviewed individually and not included in the allowance for loan loss calculation see asset quality 
loans on the management watch list are classified as special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss 
an asset is classified as substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and requiring charge off 
assets that do not currently expose the company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess weaknesses that may or may not be within the control of the customer are deemed to be special mention 
the second part of the allocated portion involves primarily a calculation of the bank s actual net charge off history excluding the apparent fraud loss in averaged with industry net charge off history by major loan categories 
the bank also employs a rating system for loans in its commercial lending and commercial real estate departments 
loans that are rated in certain categories may require a higher allocation 
the unallocated portion of the reserve involves a higher degree of subjectivity in its determination 
the bank considers its portfolio composition  loan growth  management capabilities  economic trends  credit concentrations  industry risks  underlying collateral values and the opinions of bank management 
accordingly  because each of these criteria is subject to change  the allocation of the allowance is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
in order to identify potential risks in the loan portfolio and determine the necessary provision for loan losses  detailed information is obtained from the following sources monthly reports prepared by the bank s management and reviewed by the loan committee which contain information on the overall characteristics of the loan portfolio  including delinquencies  nonaccruals and specific analysis of potential problem loans that require special attention ie management watch list  examinations of the loan portfolio of the bank by federal and state regulatory agencies  including shared national credit reviews of syndicated loans  reviews by third party credit review consultants 
for additional disclosures regarding the allowance for loan losses  refer to the section titled allowance for loan losses in this form k 
income taxes the company accounts for income tax expense by applying an estimated effective tax rate to its pre tax income 
the effective tax rate is based on management s judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes 
in addition  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on management s 
table of contents judgments and estimates regarding temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is unlikely 
in making this assessment  management must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years  the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income  and the possible application of future tax planning strategies 
while the company has determined that a valuation allowance is not required for all deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee that these assets are realizable 
for additional disclosures on income taxes  see the section titled income tax expense in addition to note to item of this form k 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans  investments  and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest spread is the difference between the average rates on interest earning assets and the average rates on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate margin represents net interest income divided by average earning assets 
since a significant portion of the company s funding is derived from interest free sources  primarily demand deposits and shareholders equity  the effective rate paid for all funding sources is lower than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities alone 
versus net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased  or  as compared to this increase is primarily attributable to a increase in average earning assets partially offset by an basis point decrease in the net interest margin to for from for since the company s average deposits grew by million  loan payoffs were high and loan demand was soft throughout much of  the growth in earning assets came primarily from investment securities 
the changes in net interest income and the net interest margin were primarily the result of the following rate the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points to  while the cost of deposits and other borrowed funds decreased basis points to for the federal reserve reduced interest rates by basis points late in and another basis points late in june  resulting in an average prime rate for of as compared to for although the company uses various indexes including prime to price loans  this decrease in prime was indicative of the general interest rate environment 
as a result of the low interest rate environment  the expected margin compression was partially offset by increases in loan fees of  in as compared to although loan fee income is a normal part of the business  the fees associated with the prepayment of loans and contingent fee arrangements are less predictable and can result in a spike in earnings since these fees are recorded in income when received 
the margin was also boosted by accretion income of  on security calls 
since the company s policy is to accrete discounts to maturity  any remaining discount on a called security is immediately accreted to income 
volume total average earning assets increased million  or  as compared to the company s average securities portfolio increased by million  or  and consists of increases in us government agency securities million  us treasury securities million  and corporate and other securities million  offset by a decrease in municipal securities million

see investment securities for further analysis 
average loans for decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease is primarily attributable to high payoffs resulting in decreases in construction loans million  commercial loans million  and residential mortgage loans million  offset by growth in home equity loans million and indirect vehicle loans million

versus net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased  or from this increase is due to a increase in average earning assets and an basis point increase in the net interest margin to in from in the increase in net interest income and the net interest margin was primarily the result of the following rate for  the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points to  while the cost of deposits and other borrowed funds decreased basis points to 
the federal reserve reduced interest rates by basis points late in and basis points throughout  resulting in an average prime rate of for the year ended december  as compared to for in  the net interest margin continued to benefit from the federal reserve interest rate reductions since the company s deposits and other interest bearing liabilities repriced downward more quickly than its loans and investments

financial condition liquidity effective management of balance sheet liquidity is necessary to fund growth in earning assets  to meet maturing obligations and depositors withdrawal requirements  to pay shareholders dividends and to purchase treasury stock under stock repurchase programs 
the company has numerous sources of liquidity including a portfolio of shorter term loans  readily marketable investment securities  the ability to attract retail and public time deposits and purchase brokered time deposits  and access to various borrowing arrangements and capital resources 

table of contents available borrowing arrangements are summarized as follows the bank fed funds lines aggregating million with five correspondent banks  subject to continued good financial standing of the bank 
as of december   all million was available for use under these lines 
reverse repurchase agreement lines aggregating million with five brokerage firms based on the pledge of specific collateral and continued good financial standing of the bank 
as of december   all million was available for use under these lines  subject to the availability of collateral 
advances from the fhlb of chicago based on the pledge of specific collateral and fhlb of chicago stock ownership 
as of december   advances totaled million and approximately million remained available to the bank under the fhlb of chicago agreements without the pledge of additional collateral 
additional advances can be obtained subject to the availability of collateral 
the bank has a borrowing line of approximately million at the discount window of the federal reserve bank  subject to the availability of collateral 
the line was unused at december  as of december   the bank has excess collateral totaling approximately million available to pledge towards reverse repurchase agreements or fhlb of chicago advances 
parent company the company has a revolving credit arrangement for million 
the line was unused at december  the maturity date of the line is april  and is anticipated to continue to be renewed annually 
the company also has cash  short term investments and other marketable securities totaling million at december  interest rate sensitivity the business of the company and the composition of its balance sheet consist of investments in interest earning assets primarily loans and investment securities which are primarily funded by interest bearing liabilities deposits and borrowings 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market rates of interest 
the net income of the company depends  to a substantial extent  on the differences between the income the company receives from loans  investment securities  and other earning assets and the interest expense it pays to obtain deposits and other liabilities 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the company  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
in addition  since the company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities are customer deposits  the company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer preferences and local competition in the market areas in which the company operates 
the company manages its overall interest rate sensitivity through various measurement techniques including rate shock analysis 
in addition  as part of the risk management process  asset liability management policies are established and monitored by management 
the policy objective is to limit the change in annual net interest income to from an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates of plus or minus basis points 
at december  and  the company was within policy objectives based on its models 
rate shock analysis assesses the risk of changes in annual net interest income in the event of an immediate and sustained parallel change in market rates of plus or minus to basis points 
the interest rate sensitivity presented includes assumptions that i the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at period end will remain constant over the twelve month measurement period and ii that changes in market interest rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve 
this 
table of contents analysis is limited by the fact that it does not include any balance sheet repositioning actions the company may take should severe movements in interest rates occur  such as lengthening or shortening the duration of the securities portfolio 
these repositioning actions would likely reduce the variability of net interest income shown in the extreme interest rate shock forecasts 
as a result of absolute interest rates being so low at december  and  rates on fed funds  the three month treasury  libor and rates paid on certain core deposits were all below  the company assumed rates will probably not decline basis points 
the scale shown below reflects a more meaningful plus or minus and basis points in addition to a plus basis point rate shock 
these projections should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results that would be experienced if such interest rate changes occurred

the change in the risk profile from december  is primarily due to the changes in interest rates from year end levels as well as changes in the composition of the balance sheet 
the following gap analysis is prepared based on the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for selected time periods 
the mismatch between asset and liability repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the gap for that period 
the following table presents a static gap analysis as of december  which shows that the company s rate sensitive liabilities may reprice more quickly than its rate sensitive assets 
however  the gap report does not capture the true dynamics of interest rate changes including the timing and or degree of interest rate changes 
while most of the asset categories rates change when certain independent indices such as the prime rate change  most liability categories are repriced at the company s discretion subject  however  to competitive interest rate pressures 
also  the gap report does not reflect the call associated with certain investment assets  which if called  reduces the negative cumulative gap for the time periods of one year or less

capital resources one of the company s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to warrant the confidence of its customers  shareholders and bank regulatory agencies 
a strong capital base is needed to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities that arise and to provide assurance to depositors and creditors 
banking is inherently a risk taking activity requiring a sufficient level of capital to effectively and efficiently manage these risks 
the company s capital objectives are to maintain sufficient capital to support the risk characteristics of the company and the bank  and maintain capital ratios which meet and exceed the well capitalized regulatory capital ratio guidelines for the bank  thereby minimizing regulatory intervention and lowering fdic assessments 
at december   the company s shareholders equity totaled million 
the company s and the bank s capital ratios not only exceeded minimum regulatory guidelines  but also the fdic criteria for

r requires the deconsolidation of statutory trusts for financial statement presentation 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued a supervisory letter instructing bank holding companies to continue to include the trups in their tier capital for regulatory capital purposes until notice is given to the contrary 
the federal reserve intends to review the regulatory implications of any accounting treatment changes and  if necessary or warranted  provide further appropriate guidance 
there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will continue to allow the company to include trups in tier capital for regulatory purposes 
the company would still be considered well capitalized if trups are excluded from tier capital

we are currently working on opportunities that meet these criteria 
although this form of growth requires a significant investment in nonearning assets during the construction phase and start up costs for several years exceed revenues  the company believes its market warrants judicious office additions
