item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should also be read in conjunction with the information filed in response to item above and item below 
unless otherwise specified  any reference to a year is to a fiscal year ended june background we are among the largest providers of private post secondary education in north america  based on student enrollment and revenue  and have provided career oriented education for over years 
we deliver education to our students through traditional classroom settings as well as through online instruction 
our educational institutions offer a broad range of academic programs concentrated in the following areas media arts education design information technology fashion law and legal studies culinary arts business psychology and behavioral sciences health sciences we primarily offer academic programs through four educational systems the art institutes  argosy university  american education centers  and south university 
we acquired aec and south university during fiscal as of june   we had primary campus locations in states and two canadian provinces 
our program offerings culminate with the award of degrees ranging from associate s to doctoral degrees 
we also offer non degreed programs  some of which result in the issuance of diplomas upon successful completion 
prior to fiscal  the art institutes and argosy university were managed as separate operating segments 
during the first quarter of fiscal we shifted from an educational system approach to a centralized corporate structure utilizing divisions which have been aggregated into one operating segment 
we currently have three distinct operating divisions organized by geographic location within north america the eastern division  central division  and western division 
recent acquisitions on october   we acquired dubrulle international culinary hotel institute of canada dubrulle  located in vancouver  british columbia 
on october   we acquired bradley academy for the visual arts bradley  located in york  pennsylvania 
the aggregate purchase price for these two entities was approximately million 
dubrulle will allow us to expand on our current base of students in the vancouver area  while the purchase of bradley complemented our existing presence in pennsylvania 
bradley also allowed us to reach students interested in a suburban setting and also reach the more populous centers of baltimore  md and harrisburg  pa 
the pro forma information presented below does not include these two acquisitions 
on september   we acquired percent of the outstanding stock of american education centers  inc and related companies 
we paid approximately million in cash  an additional million in notes which were paid on september   and assumed million in debt 
the purchase of aec broadened our range of academic programs for working adults 
on july   we acquired percent of the outstanding stock of south university 
we paid approximately million in cash for south  which includes million held in escrow 
funds from this escrow account will be transferred to the previous owner if certain conditions are met 
these conditions primarily relate to the development and performance of certain health profession programs 
the purchase of south university broadened our program offerings in the health sciences 
the following table reports pro forma information as if the acquisitions of south university and aec had been completed at july  pro forma results for the year ended june  include million in expenses for aec pertaining to stock compensation payouts and costs incurred related to the acquisition by us 
these stock plans at aec are no longer in place and we do not expect to incur charges of this nature in future periods 
year ended june  unaudited  in thousands  except per share amounts net revenues as reported pro forma net income as reported pro forma diluted earnings per share as reported pro forma the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets we acquired and liabilities we assumed in connection with our acquisition of aec in thousands current assets property and equipment intangible assets goodwill total assets acquired current liabilities net assets acquired the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets we acquired and liabilities we assumed in connection with our acquisition of south university in thousands current assets property and equipment intangible assets goodwill total assets acquired current liabilities net assets acquired the following table presents the intangible assets with finite lives we acquired with the purchase of aec dollars in thousands amount amortization period years curriculum accreditation title iv student contracts and applications total the following table presents the intangible assets with finite lives we acquired with the purchase of south dollars in thousands amount amortization period years curriculum accreditation title iv student contracts and applications total on november   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of infocast digital arts inc  which operated ida institute of digital arts in richmond  british columbia  canada  for approximately million in cash 
this school was renamed the art institute of vancouver 
on october   we purchased assets and assumed certain liabilities of california design college  located in los angeles  california  for approximately million in cash 
on october   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of the center for digital imaging and sound cdis in burnaby  british columbia  canada for approximately million in cash 
this school was renamed the art institute of vancouver burnaby 
we acquired infocast digital arts  california design college and cdis as part of our strategy to enter new geographic areas we believe are attractive based on a number of factors and to solidify our presence in growing markets 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
the results of operations for each of the acquired entities have been consolidated as of the respective closing date 
the fair value for the material acquisitions described above has been determined by an independent appraisal by a third party 
any excess purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill and other intangible assets included in assets acquired 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information related to our acquisitions 
start up schools and smaller acquisitions are expected to incur operating losses during the first two to three years following their opening or purchase 
the combined operating losses of these newer schools were approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we expect to open up to five new start up campuses during fiscal results of operations net revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal income before interest and taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal acquisitions contributed approximately million and million  respectively  to our revenue growth and pre tax income during other than the acquisitions  the increase in average quarterly enrollment was primarily due to new education programs and additional school locations  along with expanded bachelor s degree offerings and online educational programs 
our largest source of revenue is tuition collected from our students which is presented after deducting refunds  scholarships and other adjustments 
we recognize revenue on a pro rata basis over the term of instruction or occupancy 
net revenues consist of tuition and fees  student housing fees  bookstore sales  restaurant sales in connection with culinary programs  workshop fees and sales of related study materials 
tuition revenue generally varies based on the average tuition charge per credit hour  type of program  specific curriculum and the average student population 
bookstore and housing revenue is largely a function of the average student population at our art institutes 
the average student population is influenced by the number of continuing students attending school at the beginning of a period and by the number of new students entering school during such period 
we believe that the size of our student population at our campuses is influenced by the number of graduating high school students  the attractiveness of our program offerings  the effectiveness of our marketing efforts  changes in technology  the persistence of our students  the length of the education programs  our overall educational reputation and general economic conditions 
the introduction of additional program offerings at existing schools and the establishment of new schools through acquisition or start up are important factors influencing our average student population 
tuition increases have been implemented in varying amounts in each of the past several years 
historically  we have been able to pass along cost increases through increases in tuition 
average tuition rates for schools owned for more than one year increased by approximately during both fiscal and fiscal tuition rates vary by geographic region  but are generally consistent from program to program at the respective schools 
the majority of our students rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  especially title iv programs  to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
for the years ended june   and approximately  and  respectively  of our net revenues were indirectly derived from title iv programs 
educational services expense consists primarily of costs related to the development  delivery and administration of our education programs 
major cost components are faculty compensation  administrative salaries  costs of educational materials  facility occupancy costs  information systems costs  bad debt expense and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 
general and administrative expense consists of marketing and student admissions expenses and certain central staff departmental costs such as executive management  finance and accounting  legal  corporate development and other departments that do not provide direct services to our students 
we have centralized many of these services to gain consistency in management reporting  efficiency in administrative effort and cost control 
depreciation is recognized using the straight line method over the useful lives or lease terms of the related assets for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax reporting purposes 
amortization of intangibles relates to the values assigned to identifiable intangible assets and write offs and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
these intangible assets arose principally from the acquisitions of schools 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship of certain statements of income items to net revenues 
year ended june  net revenues costs and expenses educational services general and administrative amortization of intangible assets income before interest and taxes interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended june  compared with year ended june  net revenues average quarterly student enrollment was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the previously mentioned acquisitions contributed of this growth in student population 
our net revenues increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to increases in student enrollment and tuition rates  as well as recent acquisitions 
in addition  our tuition increased by approximately over the prior year 
revenue from schools acquired during fiscal totaled million 
net housing revenues increased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and revenues from bookstore sales in fiscal grew by to million 
both increased primarily as a result of higher average student enrollment 
housing and bookstore revenue is generated primarily through the art institutes 
educational services our educational services expense increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to the incremental costs incurred to support higher student enrollment 
these costs include employee compensation  rent and other facility operating costs  cost of sales  bad debt  and depreciation and amortization 
educational services expense from schools acquired during fiscal totaled million 
overall  educational services expense as a percentage of revenue decreased approximately basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease is attributable primarily to leverage on our facilities and staff personnel expenses on higher enrollment levels 
these favorable items were offset  in part  by an approximately basis point increase in bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue was due in part to the addition of aec  which historically experienced higher bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue than our other schools 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal the increase over the prior fiscal year primarily reflects increases in marketing and admissions expenses  and salaries and benefits expenses including million related to newly acquired entities 
as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expense was flat compared to fiscal during fiscal  we experienced favorable results due to leverage of our facilities and telecommunications expenses which was offset by higher compensation expense for general and administrative employees as compared to the prior year and increased outside accounting  auditing and legal fees due primarily to sarbanes oxley implementation and a dispute with the aba over the provisional accreditation of western state university law school 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangibles increased by million  to million  in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase primarily resulted from million of amortization of intangible assets with schools acquired during fiscal interest expense  net net interest expense was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the increase of million or as compared to the prior year is primarily a result of borrowings incurred to fund acquisitions during fiscal the average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in average borrowings under the revolving credit facility was offset  in part  by a decrease in the average interest rate on the revolving credit facility from in fiscal to in fiscal in addition  we had borrowings under a mortgage obligation of approximately million and million at june  and june   respectively 
net interest expense includes  among other items  the amortization of million in fees paid in connection with the amendment of our revised credit agreement during fiscal  offset by million in interest and dividend income 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was for fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the change in the rate as compared to the prior year is due to an increase in the valuation allowance related to canadian deferred tax assets and the distribution of taxable income to states with higher tax rates 
in addition  no tax benefit was recorded on losses incurred by our canadian entities and the charge of million was recognized in the fiscal fourth quarter to increase the valuation allowance attributable to slower than expect growth at our canadian schools 
this reserve does not affect our ability to utilize and realize the deferred tax assets in the future 
net income net income increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is attributable to improved results from operations as well as recent acquisitions  partially offset by increased amortization of intangibles expense and a higher tax provision in fiscal year ended june  compared with year ended june  net revenues net revenues increased by to million in from million in primarily due to an increase of in student enrollment to  from  in the prior year accompanied by tuition increases 
increases in total enrollment were influenced by the higher number of potential students  including increasing numbers of high school graduates  new locations through start up or acquisition  and expansion of education programs 
the average academic year tuition increased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal average enrollment at locations operated by us for two years or more increased in to  compared to  in in addition to the growth at more established locations  acquisitions during fiscal have contributed approximately million or to the growth in net revenues 
fiscal includes a full year of revenue for miami international university of art design and iti information technology institute  neither of which we owned for the entire comparable prior year 
additionally  the art institute of vancouver burnaby and california design college were purchased in october and the art institute of vancouver was purchased in november net housing revenues increased by to million in from million in and revenues from bookstore sales in grew by to million 
both increased primarily as a result of higher average student enrollment 
we acquired argosy on december  and have incorporated their results from that date forward 
argosy does not have student housing revenue 
overall refunds increased to million in from million in educational services educational services expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to additional costs required to service higher student enrollment  accompanied by normal cost increases for wages and other services 
additionally  on april   we revised the estimated useful lives of several classes of fixed assets to more accurately reflect the current estimates on actual usage 
this change in accounting estimate increased educational services expense by million and included the write off of the net book value of certain fixed assets as of the start of fiscal fourth quarter 
the charge related solely to changing the estimated useful lives of certain fixed asset categories 
while the estimated useful lives of three classes of assets were extended  the shortening of the lives assigned to personal computers from five years to three years more than offset the impact of the extended lives 
educational services expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal approximately million of the increase in educational services expenses was attributable to schools owned by us prior to and million was attributable to schools added in fiscal and fiscal overall  the primary components of the increase included salaries  rent and operating expenses as well as increased depreciation associated with recent capital expenditures and the change in useful lives 
as a percentage of net revenues  educational services expense increased approximately basis points to as compared to in fiscal this increase reflects the increased investment in schools  including expenses such as deprecation  facility costs and instructional salaries  offset by improvement in bad debt expense 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by million or  to million in from million in primarily due to incremental marketing and student admissions expenses incurred to generate higher student enrollment at the schools 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expense improved as a result of increased leverage on certain fixed costs as well as marketing and admissions expense and corporate costs increasing at a lesser rate than net revenue 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangibles increased by approximately million to million in due to the incremental amortization associated with intangibles purchased  along with amortization of ongoing curriculum 
this increase was partially offset by several intangible assets that had been amortized in becoming fully amortized in additionally  during fiscal a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million was included with the amortization of intangible assets in connection with the planned closures of ncpt and of the halifax  nova scotia location of iti information technology institute 
interest expense  net we had net interest expense of million in as compared to million in our outstanding borrowings were reduced significantly at the end of the second quarter of fiscal due to proceeds received in a public offering of our common stock the offering 
the average outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were approximately million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal the average borrowing rate decreased approximately basis points  from in fiscal to in fiscal in addition  we had borrowings under a mortgage obligation 
net interest expense includes  among other items  the amortization of fees paid in connection with amendment of our credit agreement the credit agreement during fiscal provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in  compared to in the income tax provision for was reduced by approximately million resulting from a one time tax credit for the rehabilitation of the building occupied by the art institute of pittsburgh 
the effective rates differed from the combined federal and state statutory rates due to the net impact of goodwill and non deductible expenses 
at june   we had state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
a valuation allowance has been applied against million of the foreign net operating loss carryforward 
these expire at various dates beginning in fiscal through net income net income increased by million or to million in  from million in the increase resulted from improved operations at our schools  especially improved profitability at newer schools  the full year impact of the argosy acquisition  and reduced interest expense  all of which were partially offset by a higher effective tax rate 
quarterly financial results unaudited we have experienced seasonality in our results of operations primarily due to the pattern of student enrollment 
historically  our lowest quarterly revenues and income have been in the first quarter july to september of our fiscal year due to fewer students being enrolled during the summer months and expenses incurred in preparation for the peak enrollment in the fall quarter october to december 
we expect that this seasonal trend will continue 
the following table sets forth our quarterly results for fiscal and quarter ended sept 
summer dec 
fall mar 
winter june spring dollars in thousands  except per share data fiscal net revenues income before interest and income taxes income before income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted fiscal net revenues income before interest and income taxes income before income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted our board of directors declared a stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend  payable at the rate of one share of common stock for each outstanding share as of the close of business on december  the shares issued for the stock split were distributed on december  the share information for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million adjustment to employee benefit expense for lower than expected heath insurance claims for fiscal and a reserve of million to increase the valuation allowance related to our canadian net deferred tax assets 
the estimated of the incurred but not reported claims used during prior fiscal quarters was found to be higher than the amounts determined at the end of fiscal  leading to adjustment 
on april   we revised the estimated useful lives of several classes of fixed assets to more accurately reflect the current estimates on actual usage 
this change in accounting estimate increased educational services expense by million 
this charge related solely to changing the estimated useful lives of certain fixed asset categories 
while the estimated useful lives of three classes of assets were extended  the shortening of the lives assigned to personal computers from five to three years more than offset the impact of the extended lives 
earnings per share amounts for each quarter are required to be calculated independently and therefore may not total to the amount calculated for the year 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  cash generated from operations of million  proceeds from both the net increase in debt of million and the issuance of common stock of million were used primarily to fund the cash component of acquisitions of million and to invest million in property and equipment 
we had million of cash unrestricted on hand at june  the increase of million over the prior year s cash balance primarily represents the impact of acquisitions described above and the timing of income tax installment payments 
our current liabilities exceeded current assets by million at june   as compared to working capital of million and million at june  and june  respectively 
this change was primarily a result of the increase in borrowings under both the revolving credit facility and note payable issued in connection with the acquisition of aec 
net trade receivables increased by million from million at june  to million at june  the increase in net trade receivables relates primarily to higher student enrollment and the corresponding revenue increases 
the days sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso and other receivables decreased approximately day to days at june  as compared to last year 
we calculate dso by dividing net receivables by average revenue for the preceding quarter 
quarterly average revenue is determined by taking the total revenue for a quarter and dividing by the daily number of days in a quarter 
cash flow from operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flow from operations over the prior year was due to the increase in net income and the timing of receipt of student loan proceeds in fiscal federal regulations provide for transfer of student loan proceeds only within days before the start of classes 
the timing of the start of the summer academic quarter for the art institutes in fiscal allowed for receipt of the loan proceeds for the summer quarter in june of fiscal for the comparable academic quarter for and  the funds were received in july of the respective fiscal year 
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of cash flows include two changes from amounts presented in our august  earnings release 
cash flows from operations are approximately million higher and shareholders investment accumulated other comprehensive income is approximately million lower than reported in our earnings release 
these changes do not impact our consolidated statement of income 
the change to the balance sheet reflects an adjustment between accumulated other comprehensive income and deferred income tax liability related to the additional valuation allowance recorded to fully reserve the foreign operating loss carryforwards for our canadian schools 
the cash flow statement revision is a result of the reclassification referred to above and the presentation of stock based compensation as a non cash adjustment to net income within operating activities 
this amount was included with cash flow from financing activities when calculating the cash flow from operating activities disclosed in the earnings release 
capital expenditures were million  or of revenue for fiscal  compared to million  or of revenue  in fiscal the reduction in capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue is due in part to our focus on improving our capital efficiency and the effect of our acquisitions of aec  which has less intensive capital requirements than our other educational systems 
the expenditures relate to the investment in schools acquired or started during the previous several years and schools to be added in  continued expansion and improvements to current facilities  additional or replacement school and housing facilities  and classroom and administrative technology 
we expect fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately million 
we amended and restated our revolving credit facility credit agreement effective august  to increase allowable borrowings from million to million 
the credit agreement  which now expires august   contains customary covenants that  among other matters  require us to meet specified financial ratios  restrict the repurchase of common stock and limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the availability of borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
at june   we had borrowings of million under this facility and were in compliance with all covenants under the agreement 
we repaid all borrowings outstanding at june  in july borrowings under the credit agreement are available to us to finance acquisitions and fund seasonal working capital needs resulting from the seasonal pattern of cash receipts throughout the year 
the level of accounts receivable reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition and fees at the beginning of each academic quarter 
collection of these receivables is heaviest at the start of each academic quarter 
additionally  federal financial aid proceeds for continuing students can be received up to ten days prior to the start of an academic quarter 
our primary source of cash is tuition collected from our students 
we finance our operating activities primarily from cash generated from operations  acquisitions are primarily financed through cash generated from operations as well as credit facility borrowings 
we believe that cash flow from operations  supplemented from time to time by borrowings under the credit agreement  will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations  planned expansion to new locations  planned capital expenditures and debt service during the next twelve months 
borrowings under the credit agreement may be used by us primarily to fund acquisitions and working capital needs resulting from the seasonal pattern of cash receipts throughout the year 
we lease the majority of our facilities 
we anticipate that future commitments on existing leases will be paid from cash provided from operating activities 
we guarantee a significant portion of real estate lease obligations for our subsidiaries  including a mortgage on the building that the western state university college of law occupies  which had an outstanding balance of million at june  we would be required to perform under these guarantees if the subsidiary could not satisfy the obligations 
the following table describes our commitments at june  under various contracts and agreements in thousands total amounts committed payments due by period thereafter line of credit borrowings standby letters of credit mortgage obligation note payable operating leases other total commitments these borrowings were repaid in early july under the terms of our credit agreement  all outstanding borrowings become due at expiration of the facility in fiscal we do not anticipate these letters of credit will be drawn on 
amount paid on september  contingencies on december   the aba council of the section of legal education and admission to the bar notified western state university wsu that the council had adopted a motion to withdraw provisional approval and that the matter would be submitted to the aba house of delegates at its meeting in february on january   wsu and two wsu students filed a lawsuit against the aba in the united states district court for the central district of california seeking a preliminary injunction preventing the aba from reviewing the council s decision to withdraw provisional approval 
wsu and the aba subsequently reached an agreement pursuant to which wsu voluntarily relinquished aba approval as of august  in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement  wsu filed a new application for provisional approval by the aba on august  under the terms of the settlement agreement  the aba will perform a site inspection in the fall of following the site visit  the inspection team will issue an inspection report which will be most likely be acted upon by the accreditation committee of the section on legal education and admission to the bar in january and by the council and the house of delegates in february wsu continues to be eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs based on a separate accreditation by the senior commission of the western association of schools and colleges 
wsu is also accredited by the committee of bar examiners of the state bar of california 
regulations we indirectly derived approximately  and of our net revenues from title iv programs in  and  respectively 
us department of education regulations prescribe the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year 
lenders generally provide loan funds in multiple disbursements each academic year 
for first time students in their first academic quarter  the initial loan disbursement is generally received at least days after the commencement of that academic quarter 
otherwise  the first loan disbursement is received  at the earliest  ten days before the commencement of the student s academic quarter 
us department of education regulations require title iv program funds received by our schools in excess of the tuition and fees owed by the relevant students at that time to be  with these students permission  maintained and classified as restricted funds until they are billed for the portion of their education program related to those funds 
funds transferred through electronic funds transfer programs are held in a separate cash account and released when certain conditions are satisfied 
these restrictions have not significantly affected our ability to fund daily operations 
education institutions participating in title iv programs must satisfy a series of specific standards of financial responsibility 
the us department of education has adopted standards to determine an institution s financial responsibility to participate in title iv programs 
the regulations establish three ratios i the equity ratio  intended to measure an institution s capital resources  ability to borrow and financial viability  ii the primary reserve ratio  intended to measure an institution s ability to support current operations from expendable resources  and iii the net income ratio  intended to measure an institution s profitability 
each ratio is calculated separately  based on the figures in the institution s most recent annual audited financial statements  and then weighted and combined to arrive at a single composite score 
such composite score must be at least for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight 
regulations promulgated under the hea also require all proprietary education institutions to comply with the rule  which prohibits participating schools from deriving or more of total revenue from title iv programs in any year 
if an institution fails to meet any of these requirements  it may be deemed to be not financially responsible by the us department of education  or otherwise ineligible to participate in title iv programs 
we believe that all of our participating schools met these requirements as of june  critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  judgments and estimates are made about the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the financial reporting process  our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base judgments and develop estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
historical experience and available information are used to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
our management makes judgments and estimates on an ongoing basis that include  but are not limited to  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuations of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  valuations of acquired finite lived intangible assets and loss contingencies 
further description of how these estimates are developed is provided below 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and receivables our net revenues consist of tuition and fees  student housing fees  bookstore sales  restaurant sales in connection with culinary programs  workshop fees and sales of related study materials 
tuition revenue generally varies based on the average tuition charge per credit hour  type of program  specific curriculum and the average student population 
bookstore and housing revenue is largely a function of the average student population at our art institutes 
advance payments represent that portion of payments received but not earned and are reflected as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these payments are typically related to future academic periods and are for the most part  refundable 
we bill tuition and housing revenues at the beginning of an academic term and recognize the revenue on a pro rata basis over the term of instruction or occupancy 
for most of our programs  the academic and fiscal quarters are the same  therefore  unearned revenue is not significant at the end of a fiscal quarter 
however  argosy university and south university have educational programs with programs starting and ending dates that differ from our fiscal quarters 
therefore  at the end of the fiscal quarter  we have revenue from these programs that has not yet been earned in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
refunds are calculated and paid in accordance with federal  state and accrediting agency standards 
the trade receivable balances are comprised of individually insignificant amounts due primarily from students throughout the united states and canada 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts for most locations primarily by categorizing gross receivables based upon the enrollment status in school student vs 
out of school student of the student and establishing a reserve based on the likelihood of collection  which is based upon historical experience 
student accounts are monitored through an aging process whereby past due accounts are pursued 
when certain criteria are met primarily aging past the due date by approximately three or four months and internal collection measures have been taken without success  the account is placed with an outside collection agency 
student accounts in collection are fully reserved and evaluated on a case by case basis before being written off 
if current collection trends differ significantly from historic collections  an adjustment would be required to our allowance 
historically  however  the allowance has been within our estimate of uncollectible accounts 
use of estimates generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in circumstances include economic conditions or operating performance 
if such a circumstance existed  we would perform additional analysis based upon assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset 
if the projected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  we would determine the fair value of the asset based upon a discounted cash flow model 
if the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
we continually apply our judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
key to this process is the identification of indicators of impairment and accurately estimating cash flows 
the failure to identify an indicator or inaccurate cash flow estimates could result in unrecognized impairments 
to date  we believe our processes of identifying and estimating have produced timely and accurate recognition of impairments 
we evaluate the recoverability of the goodwill attributable to each reporting unit as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
individual campus components have been aggregated to form three distinct operating divisions by geographic location within north america 
these divisions are the eastern  central and western divisions and are considered reporting units 
the evaluation is performed at least annually and when potential impairment indicators exist as required by sfas no 
we continually apply our judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the financial projections used to assess the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair market value of the reporting units is estimated by applying multiples to earnings before interest  tax and depreciation 
to validate the multiples used  management compares the multiples to recent identified transactions where business similar to ours were sold 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities result from i temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and federal income tax reporting requirements  and ii differences between the recorded value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax basis 
at june   we had net state operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
these carryforwards expire at varying dates beginning in fiscal through we have recorded approximately million in deferred tax assets related to these state carryforwards 
no valuation allowance has been established against the state deferred tax assets  as we believe that these tax benefits will be realizable through tax carryforward availability and our demonstrated ability to produce taxable income 
at june   we had canadian net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and we had million in deferred tax assets related to our canadian entities 
we have established a valuation allowance equal to of our canadian deferred tax assets due to concerns related to the future use of the assets 
none of these foreign carryforwards have expired and we have approximately three years before they begin to expire 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether  based on all available evidence  the deferred income tax assets are realizable 
during the fiscal year ended june   we increased the valuation allowance by approximately million through a non cash charge to the income tax provision 
the recording of allowances against deferred tax assets does not affect our ability to utilize and realize the deferred tax assets in the future 
recently issued accounting standards we adopted fasb interpretation no 
r fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  for the quarter ended march  fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  relating to consolidation of certain entities 
fin requires identification of our participation in variable interest entities vie  which are identified as entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a standalone basis  or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
for entities identified as vie  fin sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to the vie  if any  bears a majority of the exposure to its expected losses  or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns 
fin also sets forth certain disclosures regarding interests in vie that are deemed significant  even if consolidation is not required 
the adoption of fin did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effect of inflation we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation 
risks related to our business the following risks  uncertainties  and other factors could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and growth prospects 
failure to comply with extensive and changing regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our business failure of our schools to comply with extensive regulations could result in financial penalties  restrictions on our operations  or loss of external financial aid funding for our students 
approximately of our revenues are derived from federal student financial aid programs overseen by the us department of education and various agencies 
for these programs to be available to our students  our schools must obtain and maintain approvals from state agencies  accrediting agencies recognized by the us department of education  loan guarantee agencies and certification by the us department of education 
as a result  our schools are subject to extensive regulation and review by these agencies which cover virtually all phases of our operations 
these regulations also affect our ability to acquire or open additional schools  add new educational programs  or change our corporate structure 
the agencies that regulate our operations periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements 
if one of our schools were to violate any of these regulatory requirements  we could suffer financial penalty  limitations on our operating activities or termination of the school s ability to grant degrees and certificates or the school s eligibility to receive federal student financial aid funds on behalf of its students 
a significant portion of our students rely on federal student financial aid funds to finance their education 
we cannot predict with certainty how all of these requirements will be applied or interpreted by the regulatory body  or whether each of our schools will be able to comply with all of the requirements in the future 
congress may change the law or reduce funding for federal student financial aid programs  which could harm our student population and revenue 
political and budgetary concerns can significantly affect the title iv programs and other laws governing the federal student financial aid programs 
congress must reauthorize the hea  which provides for federal student financial aid programs  approximately every six years and annually determines the funding level for each of these programs 
the next reauthorization of the hea is expected to take place in or  which may result in numerous legislative changes 
any action by congress that significantly reduces funding for the federal student financial aid programs or the ability of our schools or students to participate in these programs would have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
legislative action may also increase our administrative costs and require us to modify our practices in order for our schools to comply fully with applicable requirements 
if we do not meet specific financial responsibility ratios and tests established by the doe our schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
to participate in the federal student financial aid programs  an institution must either satisfy quantitative standards of financial responsibility  or post a letter of credit in favor of the us department of education and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in the federal student financial aid programs 
currently  none of our schools is required to post a letter of credit in favor of the us department of education or accept other conditions on its participation in the federal student financial aid programs due to failure to satisfy the numeric measures of financial responsibility 
however  the us department of education will periodically provide clarification of the calculation  which could adversely effect our compliance with the required ratios 
if we or our institutions fail to satisfy the numeric standards in the future  any required letter of credit  if obtainable  and any limitations on our participation in the federal student financial aid programs could adversely affect our net income and student population 
our inability to obtain a required letter of credit could also adversely affect our net income and student population 
an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the federal student financial aid programs if defaults by its students on their federal student loans exceed specified rates 
additionally  a school is ineligible to participate in the federal student financial aid programs if it derives more than of its revenue from these programs in any fiscal year 
though we believe all our schools do not exceed the specified rates for student default as of june  or percentage of revenue limitation test  loss of eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs by one of our schools could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
if regulators do not approve transactions involving a change of control or change in our corporate structure  we may lose our ability to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
if we experience a change of control under the standards of applicable state agencies  accrediting agencies or the us department of education  we or the schools governed by such agencies must seek the approval of the relevant agencies 
the failure of any of our schools to reestablish its state authorization  accreditation or us department of education certification would result in a suspension or loss of federal student financial aid funding  which could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue 
the us department of education  state agencies  or accrediting agencies may consider other transactions or events to constitute a change of control 
if the us department of education or any other regulatory agencies interpreted a particular sequence of events to constitute a change of control  we would be required to seek all necessary approvals to continue our participation in the federal student financial aid programs  and could at least temporarily lose access to financial aid funding on that basis 
some of these transactions or events  such as a significant acquisition of our common stock by someone not familiar with these rules  may be beyond our control 
if our schools do not maintain their state authorizations and accreditations  they may not operate or participate in federal student financial aid programs 
a school that grants degrees  diplomas  or certificates must be authorized by the relevant agencies of the state in which it is located and  in some cases  other states where the school is deemed to be operating 
state authorization and accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the doe also are required for an institution to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
the failure by one or more of our schools to maintain their state authorizations and accreditations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
government and regulatory agencies may conduct compliance reviews  bring claims or initiate litigation against us 
the post secondary education industry is highly regulated 
from time to time we may be subject to investigations  claims of non compliance  or lawsuits by governmental agencies or third parties  which may allege statutory violations  regulatory infractions  or common law causes of action 
if the results of the investigations are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against third party lawsuits  we may be required to pay material monetary damages or be subject to material fines  penalties  injunctions or other censure that could materially and adversely affect on business 
even if we adequately address the issues raised by an agency investigation or successfully defend a third party lawsuit  we may have to devote significant money and management resources to address these issues  which could harm our business 
loss of state grants could negatively impact our revenues from students state grants received by our students represented approximately of our revenue from our us schools in fiscal certain states in which we are operating are experiencing budgetary constraints which may lead to the state eliminating or significantly decreasing the amount of state aid to students at our schools 
the loss of access to these state grants by our students could have a material adverse effect to our business due to enrollment losses at our schools 
failure to comply with extensive canadian regulations could affect the ability of our schools in canada to participate in canadian financial aid programs 
our schools located in british columbia and ontario derive a significant percentage of their revenue from canadian governmental financial programs 
these schools must meet eligibility standards to administer these programs and must comply with extensive statutes  rules  regulations and requirements 
if our canadian schools cannot meet these and other eligibility standards or fail to comply with applicable requirements  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
additionally  the canadian and various provincial governments continuously review the legislative  regulatory and other requirements relating to student financial assistance programs due to political and budgetary pressures 
although we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in the funding for these programs  any change that significantly reduces funding or the ability of our schools to participate in these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation 
risks specific to our business could have a material adverse effect on us failure to keep pace with changing market needs and technology could harm our student population 
the success of our schools depends to a large extent on the willingness of prospective employers to employ our students upon graduation 
our schools must keep current with changing technological needs and skills demanded by prospective employers 
if we fail to respond to changes in industry requirements by offering new programs to our students or investing in new technology  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract students 
opening additional new schools and growing our online student programs could be difficult for us 
we anticipate continuing to open new schools during fiscal and in future years 
establishing new schools poses unique challenges and requires us to make investments in management  capital expenditures  marketing expenses and other resources 
when opening a new school  we may be required to obtain appropriate state or provincial and accrediting agency approvals 
in addition  to be eligible for federal student financial aid programs  such a school has to be certified by the us department of education 
our failure to effectively manage the operations of newly established schools or service areas  or any diversion of management s attention from our core career oriented school operating activities  could harm our business 
we anticipate significant future growth from online course we offer to students 
currently  the art institute online offers a broad suite of programs in the creative fields and south university online offers bachelor s degree programs in business administration and information technology 
during fiscal and in future years we will continue to roll out new online programs at the art institutes and south university along with online classes at argosy university and aec schools 
the success of our new online programs and classes depends in part on our ability to expand the content of our programs  develop new programs in a cost effective manner  and meet the needs of our students in a timely manner 
the expansion of our existing online programs  the creation of new online classes and the development of new online programs may not be accepted by students or the online education market 
failure to effectively manage our growth could harm our business 
our business has grown rapidly 
our continued rapid growth may place a strain on our management  operations  employees  or resources 
we may not be able to maintain or accelerate our current growth rate  effectively manage our expanding operations  or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may experience operating inefficiencies  and our net income may be materially adversely affected 
failure to integrate acquired schools could harm our business 
from time to time  we engage in evaluations of  and discussions with  possible acquisition candidates 
we may not continue to be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or to acquire any such schools on favorable terms 
additionally  we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired schools into our operations profitably 
continued growth through acquisition may also subject us to unanticipated business or regulatory uncertainties or liabilities 
acquired schools may not enhance our business and  if we do not successfully address associated risks and uncertainties  may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our growth and ability to compete 
in the event we decide to acquire an institution  the us department of education and most applicable state authorizing agencies and accrediting agencies consider that a change of ownership or control of the institution has occurred 
a change of ownership or control of an institution under the standards of the us department of education may result in the temporary suspension of the institution s participation in the federal student financial aid programs until the us department of education issues a temporary certification document 
if we were unable to promptly reestablish the state authorization  accreditation or us department of education certification of an institution we acquired  depending on the size of that acquisition  that failure could have a material adverse effect on our business 
competitors with greater resources could harm our business the post secondary education market is highly competitive 
our schools compete with traditional public and private two year and four year colleges and universities and other proprietary schools  including those that offer distance learning programs 
some public and private colleges and universities  as well as other private career oriented schools  may offer programs similar to those of our schools 
although tuition at private non profit institutions is  on average  higher than tuition at our schools  some public institutions are able to charge lower tuition than our schools  due in part to government subsidies  government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions and other financial sources not available to proprietary schools 
some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
our success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key personnel our success also depends  in large part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified faculty  school presidents and administrators and corporate management 
we may have difficulty locating and hiring qualified personnel  and retaining such personnel once hired 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms  could cause our business to suffer 
failure to obtain additional capital in the future could reduce our ability to grow 
we believe that funds from operations  cash  investments and borrowings under our million revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund our current operation plans for the foreseeable future 
however  we may need additional debt or equity financing in order to finance our continued growth 
the amount and timing of such additional financing will vary principally depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and new school openings  the sellers willingness to provide financing themselves for acquisitions  and the amount of cash flow from our operations 
to the extent that we require additional financing in the future and are unable to obtain such additional financing  we may not be able to fully implement our growth strategy 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and our stockholders rights plan could make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and our by laws contain provisions that may delay  defer  or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction 
for example  our articles of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock with such voting  conversion  and other rights  preferences  privileges  and restrictions as it determines  without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  our articles of incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes having staggered terms 
we have also implemented a stockholders rights plan  also commonly called a poison pill  that would substantially reduce or eliminate the expected economic benefit to an acquiror from acquiring us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors 
these and other impediments to a third party acquisition or change of control could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business that include foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not currently utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
due to our operation of subsidiaries in canada  we are subject to fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
however  we do not believe we are subject to material risks from near term changes in exchange rates 
the fair values and carrying amounts of our financial instruments  primarily accounts receivable and debt  are approximately equivalent 
we had outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and one fixed rate debt instrument as of june   with an outstanding balance of million and bearing interest at 
this obligation provides for monthly installments of approximately  with a balloon payment of million due march borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates based upon market rates 
at june  and  we had million and million of outstanding debt  respectively 
in fiscal  weighted average interest rates were on variable rate debt and on fixed rate debt 
interest rates were and for the variable rate debt and fixed rate debt  respectively  at the end of fiscal a hypothetical change of in interest rates from year end levels would have increased or decreased interest expense by approximately million for the variable rate debt in fiscal and all other financial instruments are classified as current and will be utilized within the next operating cycle
