item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations apria operates in the home healthcare segment of the healthcare industry and provides services in the home respiratory therapy  home infusion therapy and home medical equipment areas 
in all three lines  apria provides patients with a variety of clinical and administrative support services and related products and supplies  most of which are prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan 
apria provides these services to patients in the home throughout the united states through approximately branch locations 
strategy 
apria is pursuing an operating strategy to increase market share and improve profitability 
in response to the reimbursement reductions called for by the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  apria has dedicated additional resources to long term strategic planning 
apria management believes its strategic initiatives will enable the company to continue to grow despite the effects of the recent legislation 
key elements of the strategy are as follows focus on growth in its core businesses of home respiratory therapy  home infusion therapy and home medical equipment 
by offering a broad range of services  apria achieves a competitive advantage with its managed care  hospital and physician customers  enabling it to maintain a diversified revenue base 
through specific growth initiatives that enhance the company s clinical offering  apria continues its emphasis on growth in the home respiratory therapy line  which historically has produced higher gross margins than its home infusion therapy and home medical equipment service lines 
supplement internal growth with strategic acquisitions 
apria operates in a highly fragmented market  which provides an attractive opportunity to drive growth through acquisition of complementary businesses 
develop and apply best practices and productivity improvement programs throughout the company with the aim of achieving greater standardization and enhanced productivity 
success with such programs results in reduced costs and increased margins and cash flows 
apria has developed and implemented standardized clinical and delivery models  billing and collection practices and common operating procedures in its field locations and has centralized purchasing for inventory  patient service equipment and supplies 
apria continues to focus resources on identifying opportunities for further productivity improvements 
evaluate opportunities to expand offerings in home healthcare 
apria believes that with the aging of the us population  the resulting increases in medical costs and utilization of healthcare services will lead to an expansion of the number of services provided in the home 
providing such services in the home should reduce patient costs as well as enhance patient convenience 
technological advances are also expected to contribute to additional expansion of the domestic home healthcare market 
during  apria will evaluate several new business opportunities 
the initial focus will be on identifying the unfulfilled healthcare needs of apria s existing patient population and evaluating the potential business opportunity associated with each 
management expects that these opportunities  upon evaluation to determine their viability and scalability  will result in the future expansion of services that apria will offer in the home 
critical accounting policies 
apria s management considers the accounting policies that govern revenue recognition and the determination of the net realizable value of accounts receivable to be the most critical in relation to the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies require management s most complex and subjective judgments 
additionally  the accounting policies related to goodwill and long lived assets require significant judgment 
revenue and accounts receivable 
revenues are recognized on the date services and related products are provided to patients and are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  including private insurers  prepaid health plans  medicare and medicaid 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which apria operates  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts which provides for those accounts from which payment is not expected to be received  although services were provided and revenue was earned 
management performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure that recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
management applies specified percentages to the accounts receivable aging to estimate the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible and therefore should be reserved 
the percentages are increased as the accounts age  accounts aged in excess of days are reserved at 
management establishes and monitors these percentages through analyses of historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends  the extent of contracted business and business combinations 
also considered are relevant business conditions such as governmental and managed care payor claims processing procedures and system changes 
if indicated by such analyses  management may periodically adjust the uncollectible estimate and corresponding percentages 
further  focused reviews of certain large and or problematic payors are performed to determine if their respective reserve levels are appropriate 
because of the reimbursement environment in which apria operates and the level of subjectivity that is required in recording revenues and accounts receivable  it is possible that management s estimates could change in the near term  which could have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired business 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
also  management reviews for impairment of its intangible assets and long lived assets on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
apria s goodwill impairment test is conducted at a reporting unit level and compares each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the company has determined that its geographic regions are reporting units under sfas no 
the measurement of fair value for each region is based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows and is further tested using a multiple of earnings approach 
in projecting its reporting units cash flows  management considers industry growth rates and trends  known and potential reimbursement reductions  cost structure changes and local circumstances specific to a region 
based on its tests and reviews  management does not believe any impairment of its goodwill  intangible assets or other long lived assets existed at december  however  future events or changes in current circumstances could affect the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets 
should an asset be deemed impaired  an impairment loss would be recognized  to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeded its estimated fair market value 
such an impairment charge could have an adverse impact on apria s consolidated financial statements 
segment reporting 
apria s branch locations are organized into geographic regions 
each region consists of a number of branches and a regional office that provides key support services such as billing  purchasing  equipment maintenance  repair and warehousing 
management evaluates operating results on a geographic basis and  therefore  views each region as an operating segment 
all regions provide the same products and services  including respiratory therapy  infusion therapy and home medical equipment and supplies 
additional support services are provided at a corporate level and management continues to evaluate opportunities to gain efficiencies and cost savings by consolidating regional functions 
for financial reporting purposes  all the company s operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment in accordance with the aggregation criteria of sfas no

results of operations net revenues 
net revenues increased to  million in from  million in and  million in growth rates were and in and  respectively 
the growth in both years is due to volume increases  including new contracts with regional and national payors  and the acquisition of complementary businesses 
recently  apria has been experiencing increasing pricing pressure from its managed care partners as these organizations seek to lower their costs by negotiating more favorable pricing and by evaluating alternative healthcare delivery models 
such pricing pressures resulted in apria s decision not to renew its network contract with gentiva carecentrix for in accordance with the transition agreement  apria will continue to service existing patients until such service is no longer medically necessary and will continue to accept new patients through the end of march apria management estimates that approximately one half of the revenue growth in was derived from acquisitions 
apria s acquisition strategy provides for the rapid integration of acquired businesses into existing operating locations 
this limits management s ability to separately track the amount of revenue generated by an acquired business 
therefore  estimating the revenue contribution from acquisitions requires certain assumptions 
the following table sets forth a summary of net revenues by service line year ended december  in thousands home respiratory therapy    home infusion therapy    home medical equipment other    total net revenues    home respiratory therapy 
respiratory therapy revenues are derived primarily from the provision of oxygen systems  home ventilators  obstructive sleep apnea equipment  nebulizers  respiratory medications and related services 
the respiratory therapy service line increased in by when compared to and increased by in when compared to the growth in this service line for both and was primarily focused in the respiratory medication  positive air pressure and oxygen concentrator product categories  driven primarily by volume increases and acquisitions 
it is apria s acquisition strategy to target businesses with a high concentration of respiratory revenues 
home infusion therapy 
the infusion therapy service line involves the administration of a drug or nutrient directly into the body intravenously through a needle or catheter 
examples include total parenteral nutrition  anti infectives  pain management  chemotherapy and other medications and related services 
the infusion line also includes enteral nutrition  which is the administration of nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract through a feeding tube 
infusion therapy revenues increased in versus and in versus the growth in both years is mainly due to volume increases 
essentially all of the increase resulted from higher volumes in the enteral nutrition and antibiotic therapy lines 
home medical equipment other 
home medical equipment other revenues are derived from the provision of equipment to assist patients with ambulation  safety and general care in and around the home 
home medical equipment other revenues increased by in from and by in from although the company s acquisition strategy is to target respiratory therapy businesses  such businesses typically have a home medical equipment component  which contributed to the growth in this line 
a substantial portion of the internal revenue growth in this line was derived from rehabilitation products 
revenue recognition and certain concentrations 
revenues are recognized on the date services and related products are provided to patients and are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  including private insurers  prepaid health plans  medicare and medicaid 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which apria operates  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available  which could have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in  approximately of apria s revenues were reimbursed under arrangements with medicare and medicaid 
no other third party payor represents or more of the company s revenues 
the majority of the company s revenues are derived from fees charged for patient care under fee for service arrangements 
revenues derived from capitation arrangements represent less than of total net revenues for all periods presented 
medicare and medicaid 
in december  the president signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act includes a number of provisions that will affect medicare part b reimbursement policies for items and services provided by apria  the most significant of which are the legislation provides for a freeze on annual payment increases for durable medical equipment from through further  beginning in  reimbursement for five durable medical equipment categories will be reduced based on the median price paid for such items on behalf of beneficiaries of federal employee health plans 
reimbursement for inhalation drugs has been reduced from the previous reimbursement rate of of the average wholesale price to of the average wholesale price  effective january  beginning in january  reimbursement for these drugs will shift to average sales price  as defined by the act  plus 
the act requires the establishment of a competitive acquisition program for as yet unspecified durable medical equipment items and services that is to be transitioned into i ten of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in  ii of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in  and iii additional areas after until regulations implementing the provisions of the legislation are issued  apria cannot be certain of the exact impact of the reimbursement reductions 
however  based on its current interpretation of the act  apria s management estimates that the revision to inhalation drug reimbursement will result in revenue reductions from levels of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the estimated impact to revenues in from the durable medical equipment reimbursement reduction is million 
the impact of the competitive acquisition program cannot be estimated at this time 
if the inhalation drug reductions are implemented as currently interpreted and estimated for  the untenable nature of the new reimbursement model would cause apria to begin transitioning out of this product line late in the fourth quarter of the company has developed a contingency plan that includes a proper notice period for existing medicare patients and physician referral sources 
the balanced budget act of contained several provisions that affected apria s medicare reimbursement levels 
subsequent legislation the medicare balanced budget refinement act of and the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of mitigated some of the effects of the original legislation 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of addressed some of the issues pending from the earlier legislation 
however  still pending from the legislation is streamlined authority granted to the secretary of the us department of health and human services  or hhs  to increase or reduce the reimbursement for home medical equipment  including oxygen  by up to each year under an inherent reasonableness authority 
in december  centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  issued an interim final rule that establishes a process by which such adjustments may be made 
the rule applies to all medicare part b services except those paid under a physician fee schedule  a prospective payment system  or a competitive acquisition program 
as of this date  neither cms nor the durable medical equipment regional carriers have used the expedited authority 
some states have already adopted  or are contemplating adopting  alternative pricing methodologies for certain drugs and biologicals under the medicaid program 
in at least states  these changes have reduced the level of reimbursement received by apria without a corresponding offset or increase to compensate for the service costs incurred 
in several of those states  apria has elected to stop accepting new medicaid patient referrals for the affected drugs 
apria is continuing to provide services to patients already on service  and for those who receive other medicaid covered respiratory  home medical equipment or infusion therapies  if the reimbursement levels for those services remain adequate 
contractual arrangements with hospitals 
cms officials have recently initiated actions to revoke the medicare supplier numbers of a variety of durable medical equipment suppliers  including a number of apria s current hospital customers 
under contractual arrangements  apria provides home healthcare products and services to hospitals on a wholesale basis to service the hospitals discharged patients 
apria bills the hospitals for all such products and services and the hospitals  in turn  bill patients and third party payors  including medicare 
in order for a hospital to bill medicare for these home healthcare products and services  it must have a medicare supplier number 
in its revocation notices to apria s hospital customers  cms has asserted that these contractual arrangements do not comply with certain medicare regulations promulgating supplier standards  adherence to which is required as a condition of having a supplier number 
the government has construed the supplier standards to require a supplier to perform directly through its own employees some types of services that the hospitals have contracted to have apria perform 
apria believes its arrangements with hospitals are consistent with all applicable regulations and that cms is acting improperly in revoking the hospitals supplier numbers 
apria and certain of the hospitals are in discussions with cms regarding the hospitals retaining their medicare supplier numbers  the hospitals entering into alternative arrangements with apria that would satisfy cms interpretation of the regulations  and cms allowance of adequate time to transition to these alternative arrangements 
under most of the alternative arrangements being considered  apria s future revenues from the affected markets would likely decrease 
gross profit 
gross margins were in and in and as discussed above  apria s revenue line has been adversely affected by pricing pressures from its managed care partners 
the impact in was minimal  but will likely increase in and in future years 
apria has been successful in negotiating favorable product pricing with the company s suppliers  thereby minimizing the impact of the revenue pricing pressures on the gross margin 
one exception from a product pricing perspective is an increase in the cost of respiratory medications in another factor contributing to the stability of the margin has been a slight increase in the proportion of the higher margin respiratory business among the three major service lines 
provision for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts results from management s estimate of the net realizable value of accounts receivable after considering actual write offs of specific receivables 
accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible are provided for by applying specific percentages to each receivables aging category  which is determined by the number of days the receivable is outstanding 
for  and  the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was  and  respectively 
the slight increase in when compared to is attributed to a nominal deterioration of the aging 
accounts aged in excess of days were of total accounts receivable at december   versus at the end of one reason for the increase in the older receivables and ultimately  the provision  was the increased acquisition activity in the time consuming processes of converting the acquired patient files onto apria s systems delay billing of the newly acquired business 
during this time  a provision for doubtful accounts is recorded on the earned but unbilled receivables as they pass through the aging categories 
when the billings are finally submitted and  subsequently  cash is received  the provision requirement decreases 
because the majority of the acquired business in was effected in the last half of the year  there was not sufficient time for completion of this cycle on a number of the acquisitions 
acquisitions completed in were even more heavily weighted toward the last half of the year  accounting for the increase in the provision between and see critical accounting policies and accounts receivable 
selling  distribution and administrative 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses incurred in direct support of operations and those associated with administrative functions 
expenses incurred by the operating locations include salaries and other expenses in the following functional areas selling  distribution  clinical  intake  reimbursement  warehousing and repair 
many of these operating costs are directly variable with revenue growth patterns 
some are also very sensitive to market driven price fluctuations such as facility lease and fuel costs 
the administrative expenses include overhead costs incurred by the operating locations and corporate support functions 
these expenses do not vary as closely with revenue growth as do the operating costs 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses  expressed as percentages of net revenues  were in  in and in the decrease in the expense percentage in when compared to is largely due to a fourth quarter effort to decrease the labor line through improved labor productivity 
the decrease in versus reflects the benefit of the implementation of various standardization and productivity initiatives 
also  expenses were comparatively higher in due to special bonus plan payment provisions which were met  thereby resulting in the expense increase 
the and bonus plans did not include such provisions 
sales  distribution and administrative expenses in included million in costs related to the departure of the former chief executive officer and million in professional fees associated with the favorable outcome and settlement of an income tax dispute 
see income tax expense 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million in  million in and million in amortization of goodwill was million in upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   goodwill amortization ceased 
the effect of adding this amount back as though the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
were adopted at the beginning of would have resulted in net income and diluted income per share increases of million and in the increase in amortization of intangible assets in was due to the application of eitf no 
issued by the fasb in late application resulted in the valuation of certain customer relationships acquired in the business combinations 
interest expense and income 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest income was  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense increased due to the issuance of million of convertible senior notes in august  bearing interest at 
the additional interest was offset by lower interest on the bank loans due to a million reduction in the principal balance and the full year s effect of the lower applicable interest margin on the million term loan resulting from a june amendment to the credit agreement 
the difference in interest income between and is mainly due to the million interest refund received in in conjunction with the favorable outcome of an income tax dispute 
the decrease in interest expense in when compared to can be attributed to a number of factors 
the dramatic decreases in market driven interest rates that took place over the course of are fully reflected in in july  both the then current bank loans and the million senior subordinated notes were refinanced entirely through bank loans at significantly more favorable terms 
interest expense in reflects a full year s benefit of this refinancing 
the refinancing also resulted in the write off of debt issuance costs related to the notes and old bank debt that  in turn  lowered the related amortization expense 
the lower applicable margin negotiated in the june credit agreement amendment reduced interest expense in the second half of the year 
and finally  long term debt was reduced by million during  which further reduced interest expense 
see income tax expense and long term debt 
income tax expense 
income taxes were million  million and million for  and  respectively  and were provided at the effective tax rates expected to be applicable for each year 
the income tax provision for was reduced by a benefit of million that resulted from the favorable outcome of an income tax dispute which was settled in the fourth quarter of as a result of settling the tax dispute  apria utilized approximately million of its previously limited million net operating loss carryforward during such net operating loss carryforward was generated prior to and utilization had been limited to million per year in accordance with internal revenue code section prior to  the million net operating loss carryforward was not recognized for financial statement reporting purposes as management believed it unlikely that they would be used before expiration 
the remaining net operating loss carryforward of approximately million was excluded from the related deferred tax assets and has expired unused 
at december   apria has federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
apria expects to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards in the company utilized its remaining alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of million in additionally  the company has various state net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources apria s principal source of liquidity is its operating cash flow  which is supplemented by a million revolving credit facility 
apria s ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of its operating needs has afforded it the ability  among other things  to pursue its acquisition strategy and fund patient service equipment purchases to support revenue growth  while continuing to reduce long term debt 
apria s management believes that its operating cash flow and revolving credit line will continue to be sufficient to fund its operations and growth strategies 
however  sustaining the current cash flow levels is dependent on many factors  some of which are not within apria s control  such as government reimbursement levels and the financial health of its payors 
cash flow 
cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in operating cash flow was relatively flat between and despite the fact that reflects income tax payments totaling million as compared to income tax refunds of million in the company will continue to make significant income tax payments as apria has utilized the majority of its remaining net operating loss carryforwards 
the primary offset to the increase in tax payments is the increase in net income before items not requiring cash  as adjusted to factor out the favorable settlement in of the tax dispute 
also contributing to the operating cash flow increase in was a lower rate of accounts receivable growth in relative to the revenue growth  as compared to the operating cash flow increase in versus was primarily attributable to the increase in net income before items not requiring cash 
also contributing to the increase was the income tax refund related to the tax settlement 
the cash flow increase was offset by an increase in accounts receivable and the timing of disbursements processed through accounts payable 
also offsetting the net income increase in was a decrease in accrued expenses 
see income tax expense 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to increased acquisition activity 
the increase in acquisitions also contributed to the increase in patient service equipment expenditures 
often  the patient service equipment acquired in business combinations does not meet apria s standards or is not adequate to support the company s delivery models  resulting in incremental equipment purchases 
cash used in investing activities decreased in when compared to due to lower levels of acquisition activity and patient service equipment expenditures 
in  cash provided by financing activities was million  compared to cash used in financing activities of million and million for and  respectively 
cash provided in by financing activities is primarily due to the net proceeds received upon issuance of million of convertible senior notes 
the company repurchased a total of million of its common stock in  million of which was purchased with the convertible note proceeds 
the main reason for the increase in cash used in financing activities between and is a common stock repurchase in the aggregate amount of million in see long term debt and treasury stock 
contractual cash obligations 
the following table summarizes apria s long term cash payment obligations to which the company is contractually bound for the year ending december  in millions total term loans convertible senior notes capital lease obligations other long term debt operating leases deferred acquisition payments total contractual cash obligations accounts receivable 
accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts increased by million during  which is primarily attributable to the revenue increase 
days sales outstanding calculated as of each period end by dividing accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  by the day rolling average of net revenues were days at december  compared to at december  accounts aged in excess of days were of total receivables at december  and at the end of see critical accounting policies 
unbilled receivables 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables of million and million at december  and  respectively 
delays  ranging from a day up to several weeks  between the date of service and billing can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources 
earned but unbilled receivables are aged from date of service and are considered in apria s analysis of historical performance and collectibility 
the increase in from the end of is largely due to acquisitions effected during the time consuming processes of converting patient files onto apria s systems and obtaining provider numbers from government payors routinely delay billing of the newly acquired business 
inventories and patient service equipment 
inventories consist primarily of pharmaceuticals and disposable products used in conjunction with patient service equipment 
patient service equipment consists of respiratory and home medical equipment that is provided to in home patients for the course of their care plan  normally on a rental basis  and subsequently returned to apria for redistribution after cleaning and preventive maintenance is performed 
the branch locations serve as the primary point from which inventories and patient service equipment are delivered to the patient 
the branches are supplied with inventory and equipment from the regional warehouses  where the purchasing responsibility lies 
the regions are also responsible for repairs and scheduled maintenance of patient service equipment  which adds to the frequent movement of equipment between the region and branch locations 
further  at any given time  approximately of apria s patient service equipment is located in patients homes 
inherent in this asset flow is the fact that losses will occur 
management has successfully instituted a number of controls over the company s inventories and patient service equipment to minimize such losses 
however  there can be no assurance that apria will be able to maintain its current level of control over inventories and patient service equipment 
continued revenue growth is directly dependent on apria s ability to fund its inventory and patient service equipment requirements 
deferred income taxes 
the decrease in deferred tax assets combined current and non current from december  to december  is primarily due to the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
see income tax expense 
long term debt 
apria has a million senior secured credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by bank of america  na the credit agreement consists of a million term loan  a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
in june  the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date  reduce the applicable interest rate margins and modify the repayment schedule for the million term loan 
in august  the credit agreement was further amended to permit the issuance of the million convertible senior notes and the concurrent repurchase of million of apria s outstanding common stock with a portion of the proceeds 
the remaining payment schedule on the million term loan requires consecutive quarterly payments ranging from million to million with the final payment of million due on july  the remaining payment schedule on the million term loan requires consecutive quarterly payments of  followed by three consecutive quarterly payments of million with the final payment of million due on july  the final maturity date for the revolving credit facility is july  the senior secured credit agreement permits apria to select one of two variable interest rates 
one option is the base rate  which is expressed as the higher of a the federal funds rate plus or b the prime rate 
the other option is the eurodollar rate  which is based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
interest on outstanding balances under the senior secured credit agreement is determined by adding a margin to the eurodollar rate or base rate in effect at each interest calculation date 
the applicable margins for the revolving credit facility and the million term loan are based on apria s leverage ratio  which is the ratio of its funded debt to its last four quarters of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the applicable margin ranges from to for eurodollar loans and from to for base rate loans 
for the million term loan  the margins are fixed at for eurodollar loans and at for base rate loans 
the effective interest rate at december   after consideration of the effect of the swap agreements described below  was 
the senior credit agreement also requires payment of commitment fees ranging from to also based on apria s leverage ratio on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
see hedging activities 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of apria

the august amendment eliminated limitations related to repurchases of the company s common stock  dividends and acquisitions so long as the company s leverage ratio  as defined by the credit agreement  is under to  and imparts limitations as the leverage ratio increases 
at december   apria s leverage ratio was to at december   the company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by the credit agreement 
on december  outstanding borrowings on the two term loans were million and there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility

concurrent with the issuance and with a portion of the proceeds  apria repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock for million 
issuance costs deducted from the proceeds plus those paid separately in cash totaled million 
hedging activities 
apria is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its underlying variable rate long term debt 
apria s policy for managing interest rate risk is to evaluate and monitor all available relevant information  including but not limited to  the structure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities  historical interest rate trends and interest rate forecasts published by major financial institutions 
the tools apria may utilize to moderate its exposure to fluctuations in the relevant interest rate indices include  but are not limited to strategic determination of repricing periods and related principal amounts  and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements  caps or collars 
apria does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
at december   apria had four interest rate swap agreements in effect to fix its libor based variable rate debt 
the terms of such agreements are as follows two two year agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million and a fixed rate of  a three year agreement with a notional amount of million and a fixed rate of  and a four year agreement with a notional amount of million and a fixed rate of 
apria also had two swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million and a fixed rate of that expired in march all rates are stated before application of the interest margins described above 
the swap agreements are being accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities 
accordingly  the difference between the interest received and interest paid is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense 
for  apria paid a net settlement amount of million 
unrealized gains and losses on the fair value of the swap agreements are reflected  net of taxes  in other comprehensive loss 
at december   the aggregate fair value of the swap agreements was a liability of million 
apria does not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance as its counterparties to the various swap agreements are nationally recognized financial institutions with strong credit ratings 
treasury stock 
during  apria repurchased million shares of its common stock for million in open market transactions 
as indicated above  million of these shares were purchased in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible senior notes 
in  apria repurchased million shares for million 
all repurchased common shares are being held in treasury 
in january  apria repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock for million through an accelerated share repurchase program 
business combinations 
pursuant to one of its primary growth strategies  apria periodically acquires complementary businesses in specific geographic markets 
because of the potential for a higher gross margin  apria targets respiratory therapy businesses 
these transactions are accounted for as purchases and the results of operations of the acquired companies are included in the accompanying statements of operations from the dates of acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer being amortized 
covenants not to compete are being amortized over the life of the respective agreements 
tradenames and customer lists are being amortized over the period of their expected benefit 
the aggregate consideration for acquisitions that closed during was million 
allocation of this amount includes million to goodwill and million to other intangible assets 
the aggregate consideration for acquisitions that closed during and was million and million  respectively 
cash paid for acquisitions  which includes amounts deferred from prior year acquisitions  totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the success of apria s acquisition strategy is directly dependent on apria s ability to maintain and or generate sufficient liquidity to fund such purchases 
hipaa 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of is comprised of a number of components 
pursuant to the administrative simplification section of hipaa  hhs has issued multiple sets of regulations  each with its own compliance date 
regulations under hipaa that may have a material effect on apria govern the following privacy of individually identifiable health information compliance date april  apria was materially compliant by this date  standard electronic transaction and code sets compliance date october  apria was materially compliant by this date  electronic security of individually identifiable health information compliance date april  apria expects to be materially compliant with these regulations by the compliance date  standards for a unique national health identifier for healthcare providers for use in connection with standard transactions compliance date may  apria expects to be able to materially comply with these regulations by the compliance date  and the first installment of an interim enforcement rule  when issued in full  will address both substantive and procedural requirements for the imposition of civil monetary penalties 
the standard electronic transaction and code sets regulations standardize how health claims and eligibility information is collected  recorded and processed 
the standard electronic transaction and code sets regulations also mandate that standardized codes be used for electronic billing purposes by all payors in the united states  including both government and private health plans 
historically  certain billing codes used in the homecare industry have varied by state medicaid program and certain health plans 
under hipaa  authority for approving  modifying  adding or deleting codes lies solely with the health care procedure coding system hcpcs panel  operating under the auspices of cms  and such codes are to be used not only by medicare payors  but by state medicaid programs and private managed care payors as well 
the panel reviews requests for new codes primarily on an annual basis  with a new code application deadline of april each year 
in mid october  the panel posted the revised hcpcs list for on its web site 
the panel approved very few new codes 
the absence of new codes for certain higher cost respiratory products and services could have an impact on gross profit margins  since the panel only allows one code per certain equipment category  regardless of the actual equipment provided to the patients per a physician s prescription and or patient preference 
the absence of standardized codes for products or services provided by apria also may preclude the company from submitting electronic billings to certain payors 
such an outcome would require submitting paper claims  which could ultimately result in delays and difficulties in collecting these claims 
apria faces potential criminal or civil sanctions if it does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information  use of standard transaction and code sets and use of standard identifiers 
new health information standards  whether implemented pursuant to hipaa or otherwise  could have a significant effect on the manner in which apria handles healthcare related data and communicates with payors 
federal investigation 
as previously reported  since mid apria has been the subject of an investigation conducted by the us attorney s office in los angeles and hhs 
the investigation concerns the documentation supporting apria s billing for services provided to patients whose healthcare costs are paid by medicare and other federal programs 
apria is cooperating with the government and has responded to various document requests and subpoenas 
apria has been informed that the investigation is the result of civil qui tam litigation filed on behalf of the government against apria 
the complaints in the litigation are under seal  however  and the government has not informed apria of either the identities of the plaintiffs  the court or courts where the proceedings are pending  the date or dates instituted or the factual bases alleged to underlie the proceedings 
to date  the us attorney s office has not informed apria of any decision to intervene in the qui tam actions  however  it could reach a decision with respect to intervention at any time 
government representatives and counsel for the plaintiffs in the qui tam actions asserted in july that  by a process of extrapolation from a sample of patient files to all of apria s billings to the federal government during the three and one half year sample period  apria could be liable to the government under the false claims act for more than billion  consisting of extrapolated overpayment liability  treble damages and penalties of up to  for each allegedly false claim derived from the extrapolation 
apria has acknowledged that there may be errors and omissions in supporting documentation affecting a portion of its billings 
however  it considers the assertions and amounts described in the preceding paragraph to be unsupported both legally and factually and believes that most of the alleged documentation errors and omissions should not give rise to any liability  for overpayment refunds or otherwise 
accordingly  apria believes that the claims asserted are unwarranted and that it is in a position to assert numerous meritorious defenses 
apria has been exchanging information and having discussions with government representatives in an attempt to explore whether it will be possible to resolve this matter on a basis that would be considered fair and reasonable by all parties 
apria cannot provide any assurances as to the outcome of these discussions  however  or as to the outcome of the qui tam litigation in the absence of a settlement 
management cannot estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result from these proceedings and therefore has not recorded any related accruals 
if a judge  jury or administrative agency were to determine that false claims were submitted to federal healthcare programs or that there were significant overpayments by the government  apria could face civil and administrative claims for refunds  sanctions and penalties for amounts that would be highly material to its business  results of operations and financial condition  including the exclusion of apria from participation in federal healthcare programs 
off balance sheet arrangements apria is not a party to off balance sheet arrangements as defined by the securities and exchange commission 
however  from time to time the company enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the company to indemnify parties against third party claims 
the contracts primarily relate to i certain asset purchase agreements  under which the company may provide customary indemnification to the seller of the business being acquired  ii certain real estate leases  under which the company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities  and other claims arising from the company s use of the applicable premises  and iii certain agreements with the company s officers  directors and employees  under which the company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship 
the terms of such obligations vary by contract and in most instances a specific or maximum dollar amount is not explicitly stated therein 
generally  amounts under these contracts cannot be reasonably estimated until a specific claim is asserted 
consequently  no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the company s balance sheets for any of the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk apria is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its underlying variable rate long term debt 
apria utilizes interest rate swap agreements to moderate such exposure 
apria does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
at december   apria s term loan borrowings totaled million 
the bank credit agreement governing the term loans provides interest rate options based on the following indices federal funds rate  prime rate or the london interbank offered rate 
all such interest rate options are subject to the application of an interest margin as specified in the bank credit agreement 
at december   all of apria s outstanding term debt was tied to libor 
at december   apria had four interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million to pay fixed rates ranging from to before application of interest margin 
the terms of these swap agreements range from two to four years 
also  apria had two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million to pay a fixed rate of before application of interest margin that expired march  based on the term debt outstanding and the swap agreements in place at december   a basis point change in the applicable interest rates would increase or decrease apria s annual cash flow and pretax earnings by approximately million
