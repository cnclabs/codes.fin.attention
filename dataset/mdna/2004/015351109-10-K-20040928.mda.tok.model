item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are subject to certain factors which may cause our plans and results to differ significantly from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in important factors regarding forward looking statements in the section entitled risk factors 
overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with a wide array of severe disease states  including hematologic  cardiovascular  and autoimmune disorders 
since our incorporation in january  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery  research  and product and clinical development 
additionally  through our wholly owned subsidiary  alexion antibody technologies  inc  or aat  we are engaged in the discovery and development of a portfolio of additional antibody therapeutics targeting severe unmet medical needs 
our two lead product candidates are therapeutic antibodies that address specific diseases that arise when the human immune system produces inflammation in the human body 
antibodies are proteins that bind specifically to selected targets  or antigens  in the body 
after the antibody binds to its target  it may activate the body s immune system against the target  block activities of the target or stimulate activities of the target 
we are currently examining our two lead antibody product candidates in a variety of clinical development programs 
one product candidate  eculizumab  is in phase iii clinical development for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  or pnh  a chronic hematologic disease  and our second product candidate  pexelizumab  is in clinical development for two distinct acute cardiac indications 
we are developing pexelizumab in collaboration with procter gamble pharmaceuticals  or p g  and rely on p g for the timely development and potential commercialization of pexelizumab 
currently  none of our drug product candidates is available for commercial sale 
all of our potential products are in clinical or pre clinical development and the status of each of our lead product candidates is set forth  by indication  in item of this report under the heading phase iii product candidates 
successful completion of development of a product candidate is contingent on numerous risks  uncertainties and other factors which are described in detail in the section entitled risk factors 
these factors include completion of pre clinical and clinical trials of the product candidate with scientific results that support further development and or regulatory approval receipt of necessary regulatory approvals obtaining adequate supplies of product candidates on commercially reasonable terms obtaining capital necessary to fund our operations  including our research and development efforts  manufacturing requirements and clinical trials performance of third party collaborators  particularly procter gamble pharmaceuticals  on whom we rely heavily for the co development and commercialization of one of our lead product candidates performance of third party manufacturers  particularly lonza biologics  on whom we rely heavily for the manufacture of one of our lead product candidates obtaining manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities for which we presently have limited resources as a result of the amount and nature of these factors  many of which are outside of our control  the success  timing of completion  and ultimate cost  of development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty 
the timing and cost to complete drug trials alone may be impacted by  among other things  
table of contents slow patient enrollment  long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients  lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested  and lack of sufficient funds 
if we do not successfully complete clinical trials  we will not receive regulatory approval to market our drug products 
if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products  we will not generate any revenues from the sale of our products and the value of our company and our financial condition and results of operations will be substantially harmed 
to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of products 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
as of july   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the next several years due to expenses associated with product research and development  pre clinical studies and clinical testing  regulatory activities  manufacturing development  scale up and commercial manufacturing  pre commercialization activities  developing a sales and marketing force  and increasing administrative personnel and professional services to support growth of our operations  and we may need to obtain additional financing to cover these costs 
we plan to develop and commercialize on our own those product candidates for which the clinical trials and commercialization requirements can be funded and accomplished by our own resources 
for those products which require greater resources  our strategy is to form corporate partnerships for product development and commercialization  where we will stay play a major role 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenues we record contract research revenues from research and development support payments  license fees and milestone payments under collaboration with third parties  and amounts received from various government grants 
we evaluate all deliverables in our collaborative agreements to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
deliverables qualify for separate accounting treatment if they have standalone value to the customer and if there is objective evidence of fair value 
up front  non refundable license fees received in connection with a collaboration are deferred and amortized into revenue over the life of the agreement or underlying technologies 
revenues derived from the achievement of milestones are recognized when the milestone is achieved  provided that the milestone is substantive and a culmination of the earnings process has occurred 
research and development support revenues are recognized as the related work is performed and expenses are incurred under the terms of the contracts for development activities 
revenues derived from the achievement of milestones or recognition of related work when performed under terms of a contract may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
deferred revenue results from cash received or amounts receivable in advance of revenue recognition under research and development contracts 
research and development expenses we record research and development expenses when they are incurred unless recoverable under contract 
research and development expenses include the following major types of costs salaries and benefit costs  research license fees and various contractor costs  costs of products developed for clinical trials  depreciation and amortization of lab facilities and leasehold 
table of contents improvements  building and utilities costs related to research space  and lab supplies 
research and development expenses can fluctuate significantly from milestone payments due to third parties upon the attainment or triggering of contractual milestones such as the grant of a patent  fda filing  fda approval  or achieving a manufacturing or sales objective 
accrued research and development expenses are comprised of amounts owed to suppliers for research and development work performed on behalf of us 
at each period end we evaluate the accrued expense balance related to these activities based upon information received from the supplier and estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives to ensure that the balance is appropriately stated 
such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include  among others  the following a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  and a significant decrease in market value of assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we will compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the group 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  we will then compare the carrying value of the asset group to its fair market value to determine whether an impairment charge is required 
if the fair market value is less than the carrying value  such amount is recognized as an impairment charge 
see section entitled liquidity and capital resources 
goodwill  net at july   we carry million of goodwill  net  acquired in connection with our fiscal acquisition of prolifaron  representing the excess cost over fair value of the net assets acquired 
on a prospective basis  this goodwill or any long lived investment asset is subject to annual impairment reviews 
impairment charges  if any  will be recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period in which the impairment is determined  if any 
prepaid manufacturing costs at july   we carry million of prepaid manufacturing costs for cash remitted to lonza pursuant to a large scale product supply agreement for the long term commercial manufacture of our c inhibitor antibody  eculizumab 
we are recognizing this advance over the large scale manufacture of eculizumab 
per the lonza amendment  as defined in section entitled liquidity and capital resources  the amounts advanced are not refundable and are subject to forfeiture pursuant to contractual terms related to cancellation  termination  or failure to purchase a minimum manufacturing capacity 
we evaluate the prepaid manufacturing costs against estimated net realizable value  or nrv 
if estimated nrv were not to be positive  then all or a portion of the prepaid manufacturing cost may have to be recognized as an expense 
results of operations a reclassification has been made to the presentation of operating expenses for the twelve months ended july  in order to conform to current year expense classifications 
our connecticut capital based tax in the prior fiscal year was reclassified from state tax benefit to operating expense 
in addition  certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balance sheet items to conform to current year classifications 
reimbursable contract costs that had previously been netted in accounts payable for has been disclosed as a separate item in the balance sheet 

table of contents a summary of revenues generated from contract research collaboration and grant awards is as follows amounts in thousands year ended july  collaboration grant awards p g us government grants other total revenues fiscal years ended july    and we earned contract research revenues of million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a million milestone payment from p g concurrent with the dosing of our first patient in the apex ami trial 
all other revenue in fiscal year and is primarily a non cash item representing the amortization of the million upfront fee paid to us by p g in february us government grants totaled  in fiscal and  in fiscal the  decrease in revenues associated with us government grants resulted primarily from the reduction in grant reimbursable billings from our various government grants as a result of our completion of the related research 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was principally due to decreased research payments from p g resulting from our december agreement per a binding memorandum of understanding  or mou  to revise our collaboration agreement with p g 
during fiscal year  we incurred research and development expenses of million 
for fiscal years and  we incurred research and development expenses of million and million  respectively 
we track our research and development costs by category incurred rather than by project 
our research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and benefits costs  clinical trial costs and other clinical related development costs  manufacturing development and manufacturing costs  discovery research costs  depreciation and amortization expense  and occupancy related facility operating costs 
the following table summarizes the major research and development expense categories for the fiscal years ended july    and respectively in thousands fiscal year ended july  in thousands research and development expenses payroll and benefits clinical development manufacturing development and manufacturing discovery research operating  occupancy  depreciation  and amortization total research and development the million decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from i lower clinical development costs of million due principally to the completion of the pexelizumab phase iii primo cabg clinical trial  ii lower costs for discovery research of million due to lower external research and license fees and the suspension of the unigraft program at cfc  and iii lower 
table of contents manufacturing development and manufacturing activities of million resulting from the amended manufacturing agreement with lonza and the timing of costs related to the manufacture of pexelizumab 
these lower expenses are partially offset by increased payroll and benefits costs of approximately million and increased occupancy and depreciation costs of million 
we believe research and development expenses will increase in fiscal due to  among other things  the confirmatory pivotal phase iii clinical trial with pexelizumab in cabg patients  a pivotal phase iii clinical trial with pexelizumab in ami patients receiving angioplasty  and the preparation and initiation of the pivotal phase iii program with eculizumab in pnh patients 
the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal year as compared to was due to greater clinical trial costs while sustaining greater manufacturing costs for our two lead product candidates pexelizumab and eculizumab 
our agreement with p g to bear the first of the phase iii pexelizumab primo cabg trial costs  along with our concurrent clinical trials with eculizumab in pnh  rheumatoid arthritis  and membranous nephritis patients  resulted in higher clinical trial costs in fiscal as compared to our general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million in fiscal year as compared to was due principally from increased pre marketing and business development activities of approximately million in support of our pnh clinical trials as well as continued growth of our operations 
this growth resulted in increased payroll and benefits cost of approximately  increased occupancy costs of  increased professional and legal fees of approximately  an increase in personal and franchise taxes of approximately  as well as an increase in directors and officers liability insurance and general liability insurance of approximately  partially offset by a decrease in capital based state taxes of approximately  the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year as compared to was principally due to increased costs associated with our pre marketing and business development activities and increased personnel and professional services to support growth of our operations 
the termination of our unigraft program resulted in an impairment to our unigraft manufacturing assets  principally the real estate  building  building improvements and capital lab and farm equipment at our subsidiary  columbus farming corporation  or cfc 
these assets were purchased from us surgical corporation  now a division of tyco through the issuance of a million note by cfc to tyco 
the purchased assets are pledged as security for the note 
cfc will liquidate the assets to satisfy its debt obligation in whole or in part 
we anticipate that tyco will retain the proceeds from the sale of cfc s assets and discharge the note and unpaid interest 
in august  a written offer of  was accepted by tyco for cfc s assets 
we used the accepted offer as the basis for determining the fair market value of cfc s assets and accordingly  we have written down the fair market value of these assets by  from million to  as of july  see section entitled unigraft xenotransplantation technologies program total operating expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
other income expense  net  was an expense of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  and income of million for fiscal year  and represents interest expense offset by investment income 
the increase in other expense  net  in fiscal year and as compared to was due to approximately the same amount of interest expense partially offset by lower investment income from lower market interest rates and lower cash balances 
a state tax benefit of   and  was recognized in each of fiscal year  and  respectively  resulting from our estimated exchange of our fiscal and actual exchange of our fiscal  and incremental research and development tax credits 
as a result of the above factors  we incurred net losses of million  million  and million or   and basic and diluted net loss per share for fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since our inception in january  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures principally through private placements of our common and preferred stock  an initial public offering of our common stock and subsequent follow on offerings  the sale of convertible subordinated notes  other debt financing  payments received under corporate collaborations and grants  and equipment and leasehold improvements financing 
as of july   our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million compared to million as of july  at july   our cash and cash equivalents consisted of million that we hold in short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as compared to july  was due principally to the sale of million shares of common stock in july at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts  fees and other expenses of approximately million related to the transaction  and the sale of million shares of common stock in september at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts  fees and other expenses of approximately million related to the transaction 
this increase in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities is partially offset by the use of funds to fund our operations  including prepaid manufacturing costs to reserve commercial manufacturing capacity  and capital equipment investments 
during the year ended july   we invested million in property  plant and equipment to support our research and development efforts 
we anticipate our research and development expense will increase generally for the foreseeable future to support our clinical and manufacturing development of our product candidates 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources together with the anticipated funding from our revised collaboration with p g  as well as the addition of our interest and investment income earned on available cash and marketable securities should provide us adequate resources to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently planned for at least the next twenty four months 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july  and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years 
these do not include milestones and assume non termination of agreements 
these obligations  commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts  which are subject to change amounts in millions and thereafter contractual obligations note payable subordinated convertible notes interest expense operating leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments clinical and manufacturing development licenses research and development total commercial commitments 
table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations include our million of convertible subordinated notes due march  our annual payments of approximately million for operating leases  principally for facilities and equipment  and  an open letter of credit of  which serves as a security deposit on our facility in cheshire  connecticut 
in addition  cfc is the payor under a million note 
note payable in february  cfc purchased substantially all of the assets of the unigraft xenotransplantation program  including principally  land  buildings and laboratory equipment  from its then partner in the program  us surgical corporation  now a division of tyco international  ltd  or tyco 
the purchase was financed through the issuance by cfc of a million note payable to tyco 
interest on the million note payable  at per annum  is payable quarterly by cfc 
the xenotransplantation manufacturing assets of cfc that were purchased from tyco  including the real estate  are pledged as security for this note 
upon cfc s failure to make its quarterly interest payment due to tyco in august  cfc defaulted on the note 
we continue to recognize cfc s interest expense on the note payable as such obligations have not been discharged 
in the quarter ended october   in conjunction with the event of default  we notified tyco that the unigraft xenotransplantation program and cfc activities had been terminated 
cfc is seeking to liquidate itself to fulfill its debt obligation in whole or in part 
cfc further notified tyco that it does not have the funds or assets to satisfy the million note and unpaid interest 
during the quarter ended january   we and tyco initiated a plan to sell or liquidate cfc s assets in their present condition 
we anticipate that tyco will retain the proceeds from the sale of cfc s assets and will discharge the note and unpaid interest 
in august  a written offer of  was accepted by tyco for cfc s assets 
we used the accepted offer as the basis for determining the fair market value of cfc s assets and accordingly  we have written down the fair market value of these assets from million to  as of july  since cfc s assets  consisting of property  plant and equipment  are insufficient to satisfy the million note and unpaid interest  and other obligations of cfc  we expect the unpaid amount of the note and interest will be discharged debt  recognized as other income in fiscal to cfc 
subordinated convertible notes interest on our million convertible subordinated notes due march  is payable semi annually in september and march of each year 
the holders may convert all or a portion of the notes into common stock any time on or before march  at a conversion price of per common share 
beginning march   we may redeem some or all of the notes per the declining redemption prices listed for the notes 
we may also elect to pay the repurchase price for some or all the notes in cash or common stock 
we may  from time to time  depending on market conditions  repurchase some of our outstanding convertible debt for cash  exchange debt for shares of our common stock  preferred stock  debt or other consideration  or a combination of any of the foregoing 
if we exchange shares of our capital stock  or securities convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock  for outstanding convertible debt  the number of shares that we might issue as a result of such exchanges would significantly exceed that number of shares originally issuable upon conversion of such debt and  accordingly  such exchanges could result in material dilution to holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that we will repurchase or exchange any outstanding convertible debt 
operating leases our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment 
we lease our headquarters and research 
table of contents and development facility in cheshire  connecticut 
the lease has an initial term expiring in december at this site  we lease a total of  square feet of space  which includes approximately  square feet related to research and laboratories 
we have incurred costs relating to initial leasehold improvements aggregating approximately million 
in addition  we are paying a pro rata percentage of real estate taxes and operating expenses 
our pilot manufacturing plant  which may be used for producing compounds for some of our current and anticipated clinical trials  is expected to remain in new haven  connecticut and encompasses approximately  square feet of labs and offices 
the lease in new haven has an initial term ending in october with three options to extend of one year each 
we believe our research and development facilities and our pilot manufacturing facility  together with third party manufacturing facilities  will be adequate for our current ongoing activities 
alexion antibody technologies  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  leases approximately  square feet of labs  office space and unimproved storage in san diego  california 
the lease expires in august commercial commitments our commercial commitments consist of cancelable research and development  licenses  operations  clinical development including clinical trials  and manufacturing cost commitments along with anticipated supporting arrangements  subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses 
the timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs assuming we utilize our long term commercial scale product manufacturing capacity  which may or may not be realized  are contingent upon our clinical development programs progress as well as our commercialization plans 
our commercial commitments are represented principally by our agreement with lonza biologics  plc and our collaboration with p g pharmaceuticals 
lonza agreement the large scale product supply agreement dated december   or the lonza agreement  between lonza biologics plc  or lonza  and us  relating to the manufacture of our product candidate eculizumab  was amended  or the lonza amendment  in april under the lonza amendment  the facility in which lonza will manufacture eculizumab is changed  the manufacturing capacity we are required to purchase is reduced  and future potential payments of million by us to lonza relating to achievement of eculizumab sales milestones and of up to million payable by us relating to manufacturing yields achieved by lonza are eliminated 
in august we paid lonza an additional million as a non refundable advance under the lonza amendment 
in addition  the amounts we would be required to pay in connection with a voluntary termination of the lonza agreement by us have been changed 
under the lonza agreement  as amended by the lonza amendment  if we terminate the lonza agreement on or prior to september   we may be required to pay different amounts  depending on when the lonza agreement is terminated  which are between zero and approximately million and  if we terminate the lonza agreement after september   we may be required to pay for batches of product scheduled for manufacture up to months following termination 
p g pharmaceuticals collaboration in december  we and p g entered into a binding memorandum of understanding  or mou  pursuant to which the january collaboration was revised 
under the revised structure per the mou  we and p g share decision making and responsibility for all future us development and commercialization costs for pexelizumab  including clinical  manufacturing  marketing  and sales efforts 
the revised collaboration per the mou provides that we and p g each incur approximately of all phase iii clinical trial  product development and manufacturing  and commercialization costs necessary for the potential approval and marketing of pexelizumab in the us and that we will receive approximately of the gross margin on us sales  if any 
p g agreed to retain responsibility for future development and commercialization costs outside the us  with us receiving a royalty on sales outside the us  if any 
we are responsible for royalties on certain third party intellectual property worldwide  if such intellectual property is necessary 
additionally  as part of the mou  we will receive milestone payments for achieving specified development steps  regulatory filings and approvals 

table of contents we and p g have agreed  as per the mou  that we will share concurrently of the ongoing us pre production and development manufacturing costs for pexelizumab as well as any ami or cabg phase iii clinical trial costs 
p g has the right to terminate the collaboration or sublicense its rights at any time 
if p g terminates the collaboration  as per the mou  p g is required to contribute its share of agreed to obligations and costs incurred prior to the termination  but may not be required to contribute towards obligations incurred after termination 
in such circumstance all rights and the exclusive license to our intellectual property related to pexelizumab would revert back to us and we would be entitled to all future pexelizumab revenues  if any  without any sharing of revenues  if any  with p g 
if p g were to sublicense its rights  the sublicensee would be required to assume all of p g s obligations under the collaboration 
we rely on p g for the development  manufacture and potential commercialization of pexelizumab 
termination of our agreement by p g or sublicense of its collaboration rights could cause significant delays in the development  manufacture and potential commercialization of pexelizumab and result in significant additional costs to us 
under terms of our mou we may be obligated to reimburse p g for of cancellation costs under p g s third party pexelizumab manufacturing contract 
our portion of those cancellation costs could amount to as much as million 
additional payments additional payments  aggregating up to million  would be required if we elect to continue development under our current pre clinical development programs and if specified development milestones are reached including achievement of commercialization 
approximately million of these costs may be incurred in the next three years 
taxes for tax reporting purposes  as of july   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards  which expire through of which approximately million resulted from the exercise of nonqualified stock options and million of tax credit carryforwards  which expire commencing in fiscal provisions of the tax reform act of may limit our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year if certain events occur  including a provision relating to cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of over a three year period 
we believe that we have triggered these limitation provisions 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  regarding the issue of disclosures for marketable securities and debt securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the eitf requires additional quantitative disclosure related to unrealized losses  specifically presentation of the aging of such losses 
it also requires additional qualitative disclosures to help users understand why the quantitative disclosures are not other than temporarily impaired 
the adoption of these disclosure requirements are effective for companies with fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on either our operating results or financial position 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple 
table of contents deliverables 
the issuance of sab reflects the concepts contained in eitf  the other revenue recognition concepts contained in sab remain unchanged 
the issuance of sab did not have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 
in april  the eitf reached consensus on eitf issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
eitf 
eitf addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
eitf also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share  clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
eitf is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  and requires retroactive restatement of prior earnings per share amounts 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on either our operating results or financial position 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors before you decide to invest in our company and our business because these risk factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
the risk and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if we continue to incur operating losses  we may be unable to continue our operations 
we have incurred losses since we started our company in january as of july   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
if we continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a profitable company  we may be unable to continue our operations 
since we began our business  we have focused on research and development of product candidates 
we have no products that are available for sale and do not know when we will have products available for sale  if ever 
we expect to continue to operate at a net loss for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development efforts  continue to conduct clinical trials and develop manufacturing  sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
our future profitability depends on our receiving regulatory approval of our product candidates and our ability to successfully manufacture and market approved drugs 
the extent and the timing of our future losses and our profitability  if we are ever profitable  are highly uncertain 
we are subject to extensive government regulation  if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our drug products  we will not be able to sell our drug products 
we and our partners cannot sell or market our drugs without regulatory approval 
if we or our partners do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products  the value of our company and our results of operations will be harmed 
in the united states  we or our partners must obtain and maintain approval from the fda for each drug that we intend to sell 
obtaining fda approval is typically a lengthy and expensive process  and approval is highly uncertain 
foreign governments also regulate drugs distributed outside the united states  whose approval can also be lengthy  expensive and highly uncertain 
none of our product candidates has received regulatory approval to be marketed and sold in the united states or any other country 
we may not receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates for at least the next several years  if ever 
we and our partners  contract manufacturers and suppliers are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the fda  other federal and state agencies  and governmental authorities in other countries 
these regulations apply both before and after approval of our product candidates  if our product candidates are ever approved  and cover  
table of contents among other things  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling  advertising  promotion  and export of biologics 
failure to comply with the laws  including statutes and regulations  administered by the fda or other agencies could result in administrative and judicial sanctions  including  warning letters  fines and other civil penalties  delay in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate  product recall or seizure  interruption of production  operating restrictions  injunctions  and criminal prosecution 
the fda has granted fast track status for pexelizumab for use during cpb and for treatment of ami  and for eculizumab in treatment of membranous nephritis 
although fast track status may expedite development and fda review of an application  there can be no assurance that pexelizumab or eculizumab will be reviewed more expeditiously for their fast track indications than would otherwise have been the case or will be approved promptly  or at all 
further  the fda could revoke fast track status for pexelizumab or eculizumab 
the fda has granted orphan drug designation for eculizumab in the treatment of pnh and membranous nephritis 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the fda review and approval process 
if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity  ie  the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years  except in limited circumstances 
if our drug trials are delayed or achieve unfavorable results  we will have to delay or may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our products 
we must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates before we can obtain regulatory approval for our products 
we need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and clinical human trials 
these tests and trials may not achieve favorable results 
we would need to reevaluate any drug that did not test favorably and either alter the study  the drug or the dose and perform additional or repeat tests  or abandon the drug development project 
in those circumstances  we would not be able to obtain regulatory approval on a timely basis  if ever 
even if approval is granted  the approval may require limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed 
clinical trials completed to date have not achieved their primary endpoints 
in december  we completed a phase iib trial of pexelizumab for the treatment of complications in patients after cabg with cpb including the reduction of the frequency and severity of myocardial infarctions and frequency of death 
the primary therapeutic pre set goal of the trial  referred to as the primary endpoint  was not achieved 
however  in the pre specified population that included approximately of the patient population  ie the patients who had cabg surgery without valve surgery  those that received pexelizumab at the highest dose level experienced a statistically significant reduction in larger post surgical heart attacks 
based on these results  in january  we commenced enrollment of a phase iii clinical trial of pexelizumab in patients undergoing cabg with cpb 
we completed the target patient enrollment of approximately  patients in february in august  we disclosed preliminary results that indicated that the primary endpoint was not achieved with statistical significance 
the primary endpoint in this phase iii trial was a composite of the incidence of death or myocardial infarction  measured at days post procedure  in patients undergoing cabg without simultaneous valve surgery 
we have concluded two phase ii studies with pexelizumab in ami one study in patients receiving angioplasty  a procedure for opening up narrowed or blocked arteries that supply blood to the heart  and the other in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy  a procedure for dissolving clots that block heart vessels 
the angioplasty study  called comma  and the thrombolytic study  called comply  completed patient enrollment in april and january  respectively 
results from both studies were reported at the november annual meeting of the american heart association 
in both studies  the primary endpoint of a reduction of myocardial infarction  was not reached  however in the comma study  pexelizumab treatment was associated with a statistically significant  dose dependent reduction in death 

table of contents in  we announced the completion of a phase iia trial of eculizumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  or ra 
the primary endpoint for this trial was met by the group of patients who received the mid level  monthly dosing regimen of eculizumab  but patients who received higher or lower doses of eculizumab in the clinical trial did not achieve the primary endpoint 
the primary endpoint in this phase iia trial was acr at months 
in january  we announced preliminary results of a phase iib study of eculizumab in approximately ra patients 
results of the trial indicate that the primary endpoint was achieved with statistical significance in the one of the dosing regimens the monthly dosing arm  but not in the higher  bimonthly dosing arm 
completion of these and other trials does not guarantee that we will initiate additional trials for our product candidates  that if the trials are initiated what the scope and phase of the trial will be or that they will be completed  or that if the trials are completed  the results will provide a sufficient basis to proceed with further trials or to apply for or receive regulatory approvals or to commercialize products 
results of trials could be inconclusive  requiring additional or repeat trials 
if the results achieved in our clinical trials are insufficient to proceed to further trials or to regulatory approval of our product candidates our company could be materially adversely affected 
failure of a trial to achieve its pre specified primary endpoint generally increases the likelihood that additional studies will be required if we determine to continue development of the product candidate  and reduces the likelihood of timely development of and regulatory approval to market the product candidate 
there are many reasons why drug testing could be delayed or terminated 
for human trials  patients must be recruited and each product candidate must be tested at various doses and formulations for each clinical indication 
also  to ensure safety and effectiveness  the effect of drugs often must be studied over a long period of time  especially for the chronic diseases that we are studying 
unfavorable results or insufficient patient enrollment in our clinical trials could delay or cause us to abandon a product development program 
additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials include slow patient enrollment  long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients  the failure of patients taking the placebo to continue to participate in our clinical trials  lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested  and lack of sufficient funds 
we may expand our business through new acquisitions that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
our business strategy includes expanding our products and capabilities  and we may seek acquisitions to do so 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including substantial cash expenditures  
table of contents potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition  difficulties in assimilating the operations of the acquired companies  diverting our management s attention away from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience  and the potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition will result in short term or long term benefits to us 
we may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business 
in addition  our future success would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with some of these acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to make the combination of our business with that of acquired businesses or companies work or be successful 
furthermore  the development or expansion of our business or any acquired business or companies may require a substantial capital investment by us 
we may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
we may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our stock  which could dilute current stockholders ownership interest in our company  or securities convertible into our stock  which could dilute current stockholders ownership interest in our company upon conversion 
if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  we will be unable to continue or complete our product development 
we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our operations and product development for at least twenty four months 
we may need to raise additional capital before or after that time to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we are currently conducting or initiating several clinical trials 
funding needs may shift between programs and potentially accelerate and increase if we initiate new pivotal trials for our product candidates  including any pivotal clinical trial of pexelizumab for ami patients undergoing angioplasty 
we rely heavily on p g to fund development of pexelizumab 
if p g were to terminate the pexelizumab collaboration  we could have to raise additional capital or find new collaboration partners in order to continue the development of pexelizumab 
additional financing could take the form of public or private debt or equity offerings  equity line facilities  bank loans  collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners and or the sale or licensing of some of our property 
the amount of capital we may need depends on many factors  including the existence  terms and status of collaborative arrangements and strategic partnerships  such as our collaboration with p g  the progress  timing and scope of our research and development programs  the progress  timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  the time and cost necessary to further develop manufacturing processes  arrange for contract manufacturing or build manufacturing facilities and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for those f facilities  
table of contents the time and cost necessary to develop sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost necessary to sell  market and distribute our products  if any are approved  changes in applicable governmental regulatory policies  and any new collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish 
we may not get funding when we need it or funding may only be available on unfavorable terms 
if we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back or eliminate our research and development activities or future operations 
we might have to license our technology to others 
this could result in sharing revenues that we might otherwise retain for ourselves 
any of these actions would harm our business 
we are significantly leveraged 
we currently have outstanding million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
the degree to which we are leveraged could  among other things make it difficult for us to make payments on our notes  make it difficult for us to obtain financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes on favorable terms  if at all  make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures  and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if our collaboration with p g is terminated or p g reduces its commitment to our collaboration  our ability to develop and commercialize pexelizumab in the time expected  or at all  and our business would be harmed 
we rely heavily on p g to perform development  obtain commercial manufacturing  and provide sales and marketing for pexelizumab 
while we cannot assure you that pexelizumab will ever be successfully developed and commercialized  if p g does not perform its obligations in a timely manner  or at all  our ability to commercialize pexelizumab will be significantly adversely affected 
we rely on p g to provide funding and additional resources for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab 
these include funds and resources for clinical development and clinical and commercial manufacturing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and sales  marketing and distribution efforts worldwide 
p g has the right to terminate the collaboration or sublicense its collaboration rights at any time 
termination of our agreement with p g would cause significant delays in the development of pexelizumab and result in significant additional development costs to us 
if we were to continue development of pexelizumab following termination by p g  we would need to fund the development and commercialization of pexelizumab on our own or identify a new development partner 
we would need to develop or acquire replacement expertise in 
table of contents many areas necessary for the development and potential commercialization of pexelizumab  or enter into agreements with other companies with respect to those matters 
we do not have the resources to replace some of the functions provided or funded by p g 
accordingly  we might have to stop the development of pexelizumab or shift resources from other product development programs until alternative resources were obtained 
sublicense by p g also could cause significant delays in the development of pexelizumab and result in substantial additional development costs to us 
we might also have to repeat testing already completed with p g 
in addition  sublicense would introduce a new collaboration partner which could create new and additional risks to the development of pexelizumab that cannot be identified at this time 
we cannot guarantee that p g will devote the resources necessary to successfully develop and commercialize pexelizumab in a timely manner  if at all 
furthermore  p g may devote the necessary resources  but we may still not successfully develop and commercialize pexelizumab 
if we are unable to engage and retain third party collaborators  our research and development efforts may be delayed 
we depend upon third party collaborators to assist us in the development of our product candidates 
if any of our existing collaborators breaches or terminates its agreement with us or does not perform its development work under an agreement in a timely manner  or at all  we would experience significant delays in the development or commercialization of our product candidates 
we would also experience significant delays if we could not engage additional collaborators when required 
in either event  we would be required to devote additional funds or other resources to these activities or to terminate them 
this would divert funds or other resources from other parts of our business 
we cannot assure you that current collaboration arrangements will be continued in their current form  we will be able to negotiate acceptable collaborative agreements to develop or commercialize our product candidates  any arrangements with third parties will be successful  or current or potential collaborators will not pursue treatments for other diseases or seek other ways of developing treatments for our disease targets 
if the trading price of our common stock continues to fluctuate in a wide range  our stockholders will suffer considerable uncertainty with respect to an investment in our stock 
the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
factors such as announcements of fluctuations in our or our competitors operating results or clinical or scientific results  fluctuations in the trading prices or business prospects of our competitors and collaborators  including  but not limited to p g  changes in our prospects  and market conditions for biotechnology stocks in general could have a significant impact on the future trading prices of our common stock and our convertible subordinated notes 
in particular  the trading price of the common stock of many biotechnology companies  including ours  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies whose stocks were affected 
this is due to several factors  including general market conditions  the announcement of the results of our clinical trials or product development and the results of our attempts to obtain fda approval for our products 
in particular  since august   the sales price of our common stock has ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
while we cannot predict our future performance  if our stock price continues to fluctuate in a wide range  an investment in our stock may result in considerable uncertainty for an investor 

table of contents if we cannot protect the confidentiality and proprietary nature of our trade secrets  our business and competitive position will be harmed 
our business requires using sensitive technology  techniques and proprietary compounds that we protect as trade secrets 
however  since we are a small company  we also rely heavily on collaboration with suppliers  outside scientists and other drug companies 
collaboration presents a strong risk of exposing our trade secrets 
if our trade secrets were exposed  it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business prospects 
in order to protect our drugs and technology more effectively  we need to obtain patents covering the drugs and technologies we develop 
we may obtain patents through ownership or license 
our drugs are expensive and time consuming to test and develop 
without patent protection  competitors may copy our methods  or the chemical structure or other aspects of our drugs 
even if we obtain patents  the patents may not be broad enough to protect our drugs from copycat products 
if we are found to be infringing on patents owned by others  we may be forced to pay damages to the patent owner and obtain a license to continue the manufacture  sale or development of our drugs and or pay damages 
if we cannot obtain a license  we may be prevented from the manufacture  sale or development of our drugs 
parts of our  including our in licensed  technology  techniques and proprietary compounds and potential drug candidates may conflict with patents owned by or granted to others 
if we cannot resolve these conflicts  we may be liable for damages  be required to obtain costly licenses or be stopped from manufacturing  using or selling our products or conducting other activities 
for example  we are aware of broad patents owned by others relating to the manufacture  use and sale of recombinant humanized antibodies  recombinant humanized single chain antibodies  recombinant human antibodies  and recombinant human single chain antibodies 
many of our product candidates are genetically engineered antibodies  including recombinant humanized antibodies  recombinant humanized single chain antibodies  recombinant human antibodies  and recombinant human single chain antibodies 
we have received notices from the owners of some of these patents claiming that their patents may be relevant to the development  manufacture or sale of some of our drug candidates  including pexelizumab and eculizumab 
in response to some of these notices  we have obtained licenses  or expect to obtain licenses 
however  with regard to other patents  we have either determined in our judgment that our products do not infringe the patents  we do not believe the patents are valid  or we have identified and are testing various modifications that we believe should not infringe the patents and which should permit commercialization of our product candidates 
any patent holders could sue us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing  selling or developing our drugs 
legal disputes can be costly and time consuming to defend 
if any patent holder successfully challenges our judgment that our products do not infringe their patents or that their patents are invalid  we could be required to pay costly damages or to obtain a license to sell or develop our drugs 
a required license may be costly or may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
there can be no assurance that we would prevail in a patent infringement action  will be able to obtain a license to any third party patent on commercially reasonable terms  successfully develop non infringing alternatives on a timely basis  or license alternative non infringing technology  if any exists  on commercially reasonable terms 
any impediment to our ability to manufacture or sell approved forms of our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

table of contents if the testing or use of our products harms people  we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of drugs for use in humans exposes us to product liability risks 
side effects and other problems from using our products could give rise to product liability claims against us 
we might have to recall our products  if any  from the marketplace 
some of these risks are unknown at this time 
in addition  we may be sued by people who participate in our trials 
a number of patients who participate in such trials are already very ill when they enter the trial 
any informed consents or waivers obtained from people who sign up for our trials may not protect us from liability or litigation 
our product liability insurance may not cover all potential liabilities or may not completely cover any covered liabilities 
moreover  we may not be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms 
in addition  negative publicity relating to a product liability claim may make it more difficult  or impossible  for us to recruit patients for our clinical trials or to market and sell our products 
as a result of these factors  a product liability claim  even if successfully defended  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
use of c inhibitors  such as pexelizumab and eculizumab  is associated with an increased risk for infection with neisseria bacteria 
one patient in our trials of eculizumab for the treatment of membranous nephritis became infected with neisseria bacteria 
serious cases of neisseria infection can result in brain damage  loss of limbs or parts of limbs  kidney failure  or death 
we are subject to the environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations  including the handling and disposal of non hazardous and hazardous wastes  including medical and biological wastes  and emissions and discharges into the environment  including air  soils and water sources 
failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action  penalties or the imposition of other liabilities 
we also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
under certain of these laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating its property or locations to which wastes were sent from its facilities  without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or necessarily caused  the contamination 
such obligations and liabilities  which to date have not been material  could have a material impact on our business and financial condition 
if we cannot manufacture our drug candidates in sufficient amounts at acceptable costs and on a timely basis  we may be unable to have the necessary materials for product testing  and later for potential sale in the market 
either event would harm our business 
for our drug trials  we need to produce sufficient amounts of product for testing 
our small manufacturing plant cannot manufacture enough of our product candidates for later stage clinical development or commercial supply 
in addition  we do not have the capacity to produce more than one product candidate at a time 
we depend on a few outside suppliers for manufacturing 
if we experience interruptions in the manufacture of our products  our drug development and commercialization efforts will be delayed 
if any of our outside manufacturers stops manufacturing our products or reduces the amount manufactured  or is otherwise unable to manufacture our required amounts at our required quality  we will need to find other alternatives 
if we are unable to find an acceptable outside manufacturer on reasonable terms  we will have to divert our own resources to manufacturing  which may not be sufficient to produce the necessary quantity or quality of product 
as a result  our ability to conduct testing and drug trials and our plans for commercialization would be materially adversely affected 
submission of products and new development programs for regulatory approval  as well as our plans for commercialization  would be delayed 
our competitive position and our prospects for achieving profitability would be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents manufacture of drug products  including the need to develop and utilize manufacturing processes that consistently produce our drug products to their required quality specifications  is highly regulated by the fda and other domestic and foreign authorities 
we cannot assure you that we or our third party collaborators will successfully comply with all of those regulations  which failure would have a materially adverse effect on our business 
manufacture of our drug products is highly technical and only a few third parties have the ability and capacity to manufacture our drug products for our development and commercialization needs 
we can not assure you that these potential third party collaborators will agree to manufacture our products on our behalf on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we do achieve agreement from one or more third parties to manufacture our drug products  we can not assure you that they will be able or willing to honor the terms of the agreements  including any obligations to manufacture the drug products in accordance with regulatory requirements and to our quality specifications and volume requirements 
due to the highly technical requirements of manufacturing our drug products  our third party collaborators and we may be unable to manufacture our drug products despite their and our efforts 
inability to contract with third party manufacturers on commercially reasonable terms  or failure or delay by our third party manufacturers  if any  in manufacturing our drug products in the volumes and quality required  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have no experience or capacity for manufacturing drug products in volumes that would be necessary to support commercial sales 
if we are unable to establish and maintain commercial scale manufacturing within our planned time and cost parameters  sales of our products and our financial performance would be adversely affected 
currently  we are relying on p g to retain appropriate commercial manufacturing for pexelizumab through one or more third party manufacturers 
p g has contracted with one third party manufacturer for the large scale commercial manufacture of pexelizumab 
the failure of p g to obtain appropriate commercial manufacturing for pexelizumab on a timely basis  or at all  may prevent or impede the commercialization of pexelizumab 
we have executed a large scale product supply agreement with lonza biologics  plc for the long term manufacture of eculizumab 
the failure of lonza to manufacture appropriate supplies of eculizumab on a timely basis  or at all  may prevent or impede the commercialization of eculizumab 
due to the nature of the current market for third party commercial manufacturing arrangements  many arrangements require substantial penalty payments by the customer for failure to use the manufacturing capacity contracted for 
we could owe substantial penalty payments to lonza if we were not to use the manufacturing capacity we contracted for  and we could be required to share on an equal basis with p g substantial penalty payments owed by p g for its failure to utilize the manufacturing capacity it contracted for with third party manufacturers for the supply of pexelizumab 
the payment of a substantial penalty would harm our financial condition 
if we are unable to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so  we will be unable to successfully market and sell future drug products 
we have no sales or distribution personnel or capabilities 
we have only recently established core pre commercial marketing capabilities 
if we are unable to continue developing those capabilities  either by developing our own capabilities or entering into agreements with others  we will not be able to successfully sell our future drug products 
in that event  we will not be able to generate significant revenues 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we need 
we may not be able to enter into any marketing or distribution agreements with third party providers on acceptable terms  if at all 
currently  we are relying on p g for sales  marketing and distribution of pexelizumab 
p g  or any future third party collaborators  may not succeed at selling  marketing or distributing any of our future drug products 

table of contents if we are unable to obtain reimbursement for our future products from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  our products may be too costly for regular use and our ability to generate revenues would be harmed 
our products  if commercialized  may be significantly more expensive than traditional drug treatments 
our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if we cannot depend on governmental and private third party payors to defray the cost of our products to the consumer 
if these entities refuse to provide reimbursement with respect to our products or determine to provide an insufficient level of reimbursement  our products may be too costly for general use 
our profitability may be adversely impacted if we choose to offer our products at a reduced price 
any limitation on the use of our products or any decrease in the price of our products without a corresponding decrease in expenses will have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve profitability 
if our competitors get to the marketplace before we do with better or cheaper drugs  our drugs may not be profitable to sell or to continue to develop 
each of abbott laboratories inc  adprotech ltd  avant immunotherapeutics  inc  baxter international  inc  millennium pharmaceuticals  inc  neurogen corporation  tanox  inc  and xoma  ltd 
have publicly announced their intentions to develop drugs which target the inflammatory effects of complement in the immune system 
we are also aware that glaxosmithkline  plc  merck co  inc  and pfizer  inc 
are also attempting to develop complement inhibitor therapies 
each of cambridge antibody technology group  plc  morphosys ag and dyax corporation has publicly announced intentions to develop therapeutic human antibodies from libraries of human antibody genes 
additionally  each of abgenix  inc and medarex  inc 
has publicly announced intentions to develop therapeutic human antibodies from mice that have been bred to include some human antibody genes 
these and other pharmaceutical companies  many of which have significantly greater resources than we  may develop  manufacture and market better or cheaper drugs than our product candidates 
they may establish themselves in the marketplace before we are able even to finish our clinical trials 
other pharmaceutical companies also compete with us to attract academic research institutions as drug development partners  including for licensing these institutions proprietary technology 
if our competitors successfully enter into such arrangements with academic institutions  we will be precluded from pursuing those unique opportunities and may not be able to find equivalent opportunities elsewhere 
if we fail to recruit and retain personnel  our research and product development programs may be delayed 
we are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management and scientific personnel  particularly dr 
leonard bell  md  our chief executive officer and a member of our board of directors  david w 
keiser  our president  chief operating officer and a member of our board of directors  and stephen p 
squinto  phd  our executive vice president and head of research 
there is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientific and technical personnel 
since our business is very science oriented and specialized  we need to continue to attract and retain such people 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business 
we have a key man life insurance policy for dr 
bell and employment agreements with dr 
bell  mr 
keiser and dr 
squinto 
none of our key personnel is nearing retirement age or to our knowledge  planning to retire 
to our knowledge  there is no tension between any of our key personnel and the board of directors 
if we lose the services of our management and scientific personnel and fail to recruit other scientific and technical personnel  our research and product development programs will be materially and adversely affected 
in particular  we highly value the services of dr 
bell  our chief executive officer 
the loss of his services could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our development objectives 

table of contents our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if there is a change in ownership of alexion 
as of july   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  available to reduce taxable income in future years 
we believe that some of these nols are currently subject to an annual limitation under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
our ability to utilize our nols may be further limited if we undergo an ownership change  as defined in section  as a result of subsequent changes in the ownership of our outstanding stock 
we would undergo an ownership change if  among other things  the stockholders  or group of stockholders  who own or have owned  directly or indirectly  or more of the value of our stock  or are otherwise treated as stockholders under section and the regulations promulgated thereunder  increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than percentage points over the lowest percentage of our stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the testing period  which is generally the three year period preceding the potential ownership change 
in the event of an ownership change  section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre ownership change nols 
the limitation imposed by section for any post change year would be determined by multiplying the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change subject to certain adjustments by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused limitation may be carried over to later years  and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by built in gains which may be present with respect to assets held by us at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five year period after the ownership change 
our use of nols arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected 
we do not believe that we experienced a change in ownership within the meaning of section as a result of the offering of our common stock on july  however  there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service could not successfully challenge our conclusion 
even if the offering of our common stock did not cause an ownership change to occur immediately  the issuance  directly or indirectly  of a relatively large number of shares in that offering may mean that we may not be able to engage in transactions involving the issuance or deemed issuance of stock within the subsequent three year period without triggering an ownership change within the meaning of section in addition  there are circumstances beyond our control  such as market purchases of our stock by investors who are existing shareholders  or become shareholders as a result of such purchases  which could result in an ownership change with respect to our stock 
thus  there can be no assurance that our future actions  or future actions by our stockholders  will not result in the occurrence of an ownership change  which may limit our use of the nols and negatively affect future cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
our short term investments and investments consist of us government obligations  high grade corporate notes and commercial paper 
all of our investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our short term investments and investments policy we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policies specify credit quality standards for our investments and limit the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our available for sale marketable securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase of the financial instrument 
a decrease in year end market interest rates would result in no material impact on the net fair value of such interest sensitive financial instruments 
a increase or decrease in market interest rates would result in no material impact on our subordinated convertible notes
