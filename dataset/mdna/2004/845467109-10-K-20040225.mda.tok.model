item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks described in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
you should read the following discussion with the selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview southwestern energy company is an integrated energy company primarily focused on natural gas 
our primary business is the exploration  development and production of natural gas and crude oil  with operations principally located in arkansas  oklahoma  texas  new mexico and louisiana 
we also operate integrated natural gas distribution systems in northern arkansas 
as a complement to our other businesses  we provide marketing and transportation services in our core areas of operation 
we operate our business in three segments exploration and production  natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing 
our financial results depend on a number of factors  including in particular natural gas and oil prices  our ability to find and produce natural gas and oil  our ability to control costs  the seasonality of our customers need for natural gas and our ability to market natural gas and oil on economically attractive terms to our customers  all of which are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources 
there has been significant price volatility in the natural gas and crude oil market in recent years 
the volatility was attributable to a variety of factors impacting supply and demand  including weather conditions  political events and economic events we cannot control or predict 
we reported net income of million in  or per share on a fully diluted basis  up from million  or per share in in  we reported net income of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis 
the increase in net income in was primarily a result of higher realized natural gas and oil prices and increased production volumes in our exploration and production  or e p segment 
the decrease in net income in was primarily the result of lower realized natural gas and oil prices on the operating income of our e p segment 
operating income for our e p segment was million in  up from million in and million in operating income for our gas distribution segment was million in  compared to million in and million in the decreases in operating income for our gas distribution segment resulted from increased operati ng costs and expenses primarily related to higher pension  insurance and incentive compensation costs 
our cash flow from operating activities was million in  compared to million in and million in in  our cash flow from operating activities included significant collections of accounts receivable and deferred gas costs that were generated in late by extremely high gas costs at that time 
in  our gas and oil production continued to increase  reaching bcfe  up from bcfe in and bcfe in the increase in production resulted from an increase in production from our overton field in east texas due to accelerated development of the field  which was partially offset by the loss of production from the sale of our mid continent properties in late and declining production from our south louisiana properties 
our mid continent properties historically provided approximately bcfe of production annually 
production growth in  without consideration of the sale of mid continent properties  would have been approximately 
in our e p segment  we achieved a reserve replacement ratio of in at a finding and development cost of per mcfe  excluding reserve revisions 
our year end reserves grew to bcfe  up from bcfe at the end of our results were primarily fueled by our continued drilling success in our overton field in east texas as well as our continued successful development drilling program in the arkoma basin 
our capital investments totaled million in  up from million in and million in we invested million in our e p segment in  compared to million in and million in funds for our capital investments were provided by cash flow from operations and the million of net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in the first quarter of our equity offering in the first quarter of  combined with our earnings during the year  improved our financial position and reduced our total debt to capitalization ratio to at december  from at december  
table of contents our business strategy is focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business 
we prepare economic analyses for each of our drilling and acquisition opportunities and rank them based upon the expected present value added for each dollar invested  which we refer to as pvi 
the pvi of the future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a discount rate 
we target adding at least of discounted pre tax pvi for each dollar we invest in our e p business 
our actual pvi results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments 
we are also focused on creating and capturing additional value beyond the wellhead through our natural gas distribution  marketing and transportation businesses 
capital investments planned for total million  including million for our e p segment  which is an increase of over our e p capital investments in we continue to be focused on our strategy of adding value through the drillbit  as of our e p capital is allocated to drilling 
our e p investments in will primarily be focused on our lower risk  higher rate of return development drilling programs in east texas and the arkoma basin 
we expect our capital program in to contribute to a targeted production and reserve growth of 
in we are targeting production to be approximately bcfe to bcfe  compared to bcfe in our capital investments in will be funded by cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
with today s commodity price environment  our current capital program and our inventory of projects for the future  we believe we are well positioned to continue to build upon the momentum achieved in results of operations exploration and production year ended december  revenues in thousands operating income in thousands gas production bcf oil production mbbls total production bcfe average gas price per mcf  including hedges average gas price per mcf  excluding hedges average oil price per bbl  including hedges average oil price per bbl  excluding hedges average unit costs per mcfe lease operating expenses taxes other than income taxes general administrative expenses full cost pool amortization revenues  operating income and production revenues 
our exploration and production revenues increased in to million compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher prices received for our natural gas and oil production and to slightly increased gas production volumes 
revenues decreased in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower prices received for natural gas 
operating income 
operating income from our exploration and production segment was million in  up from million in and million in the increase in was due to a increase in the average price received for our natural gas production and a increase in our equivalent production volumes  partially offset by increased operating costs and expenditures 
the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in revenues caused by the lower realized natural gas prices 
production 
gas and oil production totaled bcfe in  bcfe in and bcfe in the increase in production resulted from an increase in production from our overton field in east texas due to the accelerated development of the field  partially offset by declines experienced in our south louisiana properties that began in the last 
table of contents half of  combined with the loss of production resulting from the november sale of our non strategic mid continent properties 
production from our mid continent properties historically averaged approximately bcfe annually 
overall production in was up slightly over as increased production from our overton field properties in east texas and from our gulf coast properties more than offset production declines in our arkoma basin and permian basin properties 
gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were bcf in  up from bcf in and bcf in sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings 
intersegment sales to arkansas western were bcf in  bcf in and bcf in the changes in intersegment sales volumes reflect both the effects of weather and the ability of our e p segment to obtain gas supply contracts that are periodically placed out for bids 
weather in  as measured in degree days  was warmer than normal and approximately even with the prior year 
weather in was warmer than normal and colder than the prior year 
weather in was warmer than both normal and the prior year 
our gas production provided approximately of the utility s requirements in  in and in future sales to arkansas western s gas distribution systems will be dependent upon our success in obtaining gas supply contracts with the utility systems 
in the future  we will continue to bid to obtain these gas supply contracts  although there is no assurance that we will be successful 
if successful  we cannot predict the amount of fixed demand charges  if any  that would be associated with the new contracts 
we also sell gas directly to industrial and commercial transportation customers located on arkansas western s gas distribution systems 
we expect future increases in our gas production to come primarily from sales to unaffiliated purchasers 
we are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas  including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for our production 
additionally  we hold a large amount of undeveloped leaseh old acreage and producing acreage  and have an inventory of drilling leads  prospects and seismic data that will continue to be evaluated and developed in the future 
our exploration programs have been directed primarily toward natural gas in recent years 
commodity prices the average price realized for our gas production  including the effects of hedges  was per mcf in  per mcf in and per mcf in the changes in the average price realized primarily reflect changes in average annual spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities 
our hedging activities lowered the average gas price per mcf in  per mcf in and per mcf in additionally  we have historically received demand charges related to sales made to our utility segment  which has increased our average gas price realized 
we periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production through a variety of financial arrangements intended to support natural gas and oil prices at targeted levels and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations we refer you to item a of this form k and note to the financial statements for additional discussion 
our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings 
at december   we had hedges in place on bcf of and gas production 
subsequent to december  and prior to february   we hedged an additional bcf of future gas production 
at december  we had hedges in place on  barrels of oil production 
as of february   we have hedged approximately of our anticipated gas production level and of our anticipated oil production level 
disregarding the impact of hedges  we would normally expect the average price received for our gas production to be approximately to per mcf lower than average spot market prices  as market differentials that reduce the average prices received are partially offset by demand charges received under the contracts covering our intersegment sales to our utility systems 
future changes in revenues from sales of our gas production will be dependent upon changes in the market price for gas  access to new markets  maintenance of existing markets  and additions of new gas reserves 
we realized an average price of per barrel  including the effects of hedges  for our oil production for the year ended december   up from per barrel for and per barrel for our hedging activities lowered the average oil price per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in disregarding the impact of hedges  we expect the average price received for our oil production to be approximately lower than posted spot market prices 

table of contents operating costs and expenses lease operating expenses per mcfe for this business segment were in  down from in both and lease operating expenses per unit decreased in due to changes in the geographic mix of our production and higher workover expenses in taxes other than income taxes per mcfe were in  compared to in and in the increase in taxes other than income taxes per mcfe was due to increased severance and ad valorem taxes that resulted from generally higher commodity prices and from the changing mix of our production among taxing jurisdictions 
general and administrative expenses per mcfe were in  compared to in and in the increase in general and administrative costs per mcfe in was due primarily to increased pension  insurance and incentive compensation costs 
we expect our cost per mcfe for operating and general and administrative expense to decline in primarily due to our anticipated increase in production 
future changes in our general and administrative expenses are primarily dependent upon our salary costs  level of pension expense and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees 
see critical accounting policies below for further discussion of pension expense 
our full cost pool amortization rate averaged per mcfe for  compared to in and in the amortization rate is impacted by reserve additions and the costs incurred for those additions  revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance  and the level of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization 
unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were million at the end of  compared to million at the end of and million at the end of the increase in unevaluated costs at december  primarily resulted from unproved costs for wells in progress at year end and an increase in our undeveloped leasehold acreage related to our new venture areas 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  however  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at percent standardized measure plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
any costs in excess of this ceiling are written off as a non cash expense 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter  including the impact of derivati ves qualifying as hedges  to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves 
at december   and  our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount 
at december   our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for gas and per barrel for oil  adjusted for market differentials 
a decline in natural gas and oil prices from year end levels or other factors  without other mitigating circumstances  could cause a future write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings 
in november  we sold our remaining non strategic mid continent properties  including our properties in the sho vel tum area in southern oklahoma  the anadarko basin in western oklahoma and the sooner trend in northwestern oklahoma  for a total of million 
these properties represented approximately bcfe of reserves and produced approximately bcfe annually 
this divestiture  along with increased production from the overton field  resulted in a decrease in our average production costs per unit of production in in  our subsidiary  sepco  formed a limited partnership with an investor to drill and complete development wells in sepco s overton field located in smith county  texas 
the overton properties were acquired by sepco in april and have multiple development locations through the downspacing of the existing producing units 
because sepco is the sole general partner and owns a majority interest in the partnership  operating and financial results for the partnership are consolidated with our other operations and the investor s share of the partnership activity is reported as a minority interest item in the financial statements 
during  and  the minority interest owner in the partnership contributed million  million and million  respectively  in capital to the limited partnership 
the investor s share of  and revenues  less operating costs and expenses  was million  mil lion and million  respectively 
inflation impacts us by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions 
the effects of inflation on our operations prior to have been minimal due to low inflation rates 
however  since  the impact of inflation has intensified in certain areas of our exploration and production segment as shortages in drilling rigs  third party services and qualified labor developed due to an overall increase in the activity level of the domestic natural gas and oil industry 
we feel this impact increased in with an increase in the industry activity level caused by higher commodity 
table of contents prices 
southwestern has mitigated rising costs in certain situations by obtaining vendor commitments to multiple projects and by offering incentives to vendors for increased efficiencies resulting in cost reductions 
natural gas distribution year ended december  in thousands except for per mcf amounts revenues    gas purchases    operating costs and expenses   operating income    deliveries bcf sales and end use transportation off system transportation customers at year end    average sales rate per mcf heating weather degree days    percent of normal revenues and operating income gas distribution revenues fluctuate due to the effects of warm weather on demand for natural gas and the pass through of gas supply cost changes 
because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs  the revenue effect of the pass through of gas cost changes has not materially affected net income 
gas distribution revenues increased in and decreased in the increase in gas distribution revenues was primarily due to a higher average sales rate caused by higher gas prices 
the decrease in was primarily due to a lower average sales rate caused by lower gas prices 
weather during in the utility s service territory was warmer than normal and slightly above the prior year 
weather during was warmer than normal and colder than the prior year  and was warmer than both normal and the prior year in operating income for our utility systems decreased in and decreased in the decrease in and operating income for this segment resulted from increased operating costs and expenses and reduced usage per customer due to customer conservation brought about by high gas prices 
in october we implemented a rate increase that will increase revenue and operating income by million annually see regulatory matters below for a discussion of the rate increase and were also allowed to recover certain additional costs totaling million over a two year period 
operating income in included a gain of million related to the recovery of these costs 
gas distribution revenues in future years will be impacted by the utility s gas purchase costs  customer growth and rate increases allowed by the apsc 
in recent years  arkansas western has experienced customer growth of approximately annually in its northwest arkansas service territory  while it has experienced little or no customer growth in its service territory in northeast arkansas 
based on current economic conditions in our service territories  we expect this trend in customer growth to continue 
deliveries and rates in  arkansas western sold bcf to its customers at an average rate of per mcf  compared to bcf at per mcf in and bcf at per mcf in additionally  arkansas western transported bcf in and  and bcf in for its end use customers 
the decrease in volumes sold in primarily resulted from variations in weather and customer conservation brought about by high gas prices in recent years 
the decrease in volumes sold in resulted from customer conservation and from several industrial customers moving from system supply to transportation 
arkansas western s tariffs contain a weather normalization clause to lessen the impact of revenue increases and decreases which might result from weather variations during the winter heating season 
the fluctuations in the average sales rates reflect changes in the average cost of gas purchased for delivery to our customers  which a re passed through to customers under automatic adjustment clauses 
total deliveries to industrial customers of the utility segment  including transportation volumes  were bcf in  bcf in and bcf in the decrease in deliveries in was due to customer conservation brought about by 
table of contents high gas prices partially offset by continued industrial growth in the region 
arkansas western also transported bcf of gas through its gathering system in compared to bcf in and bcf in for off system deliveries  all to the ozark gas transmission system 
the level of off system deliveries each year generally reflects the changes of on system demands of our gas distribution systems for our gas production 
the average off system transportation rate was approximately per mcf  exclusive of fuel  in  and future volumes delivered to customers will be impacted by customer growth  weather and the effect that gas prices will continue to have on customer conservation 
operating costs and expenses the changes in purchased gas costs for the gas distribution segment reflect volumes purchased  prices paid for supplies and the mix of purchases from various gas supply contracts base load  swing and no notice 
operating costs and expenses increased in as compared to due to general inflationary effects  increased general and administrative expenses and increased transmission expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted from increases in pension  insurance and incentive compensation costs 
the increase in transmission expense resulted from higher fuel costs 
operating costs and expenses increased in as compared to due to general inflationary effects and increased pension and insurance costs 
operating costs in also included increased bad debt expense caused by high natural gas prices in the winter heating season 
future changes in our general and administrative expenses are primarily dependent upon our salary costs  level of pension expense and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees 
see critical accounting policies below for further discussion of pension expense 
in october  arkansas western instituted a competitive bidding process for its gas supply 
additionally  arkansas western annually submits its gas supply plan to the general staff of the apsc 
as a result of the bidding process under the plan filed for the gas purchase year  seeco successfully bid on gas supply packages representing approximately of the requirements for arkansas western for the contracts awarded to seeco expire through arkansas western enters into hedging activities from time to time with respect to its gas purchases to protect against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks and note to the financial statements for additional information 
inflation impacts our gas distribution segment by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions 
the effects of inflation on the utility s operations in recent years have been minimal due to low inflation rates 
additionally  delays inherent in the rate making process prevent us from obtaining immediate recovery of increased operating costs of our gas distribution segment 
regulatory matters arkansas western s rates and operations are regulated by the apsc 
arkansas western operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by virtue of state law  but are not exclusive within a geographic area 
although its rates for gas delivered to its retail customers are not regulated by the ferc  its transmission and gathering pipeline systems are subject to the ferc s regulations concerning open access transportation 
as the regulatory focus of the natural gas industry has shifted from the federal level to the state level  some utilities across the nation have unbundled residential sales services from transportation services in an effort to promote greater competition 
no such legislation or regulatory directives related to natural gas are presently pending in arkansas 
in arkansas  the state legislature enacted act for the deregulation of the retail sale of electricity by in december  the apsc submitted its annual report to the arkansas legislature on the development of electric deregulation and recommended that the legislature consider suspending deregulation to the year or  or repeal act as modified by act 
in  act was repealed 
during  the apsc will conduct collaborative meetings to study the feasibility of a large user access program for electric service choice 
although arkansas western already provides transportation service for its large users  this collaborative process could set regulatory precedents that would also affect natural gas utilities in the future 
these effects may include protection of other customer classes against cost shifting and the regulatory treatment of stranded costs 
arkansas western has historically maintained a price advantage over electricity for most applications 
this has enabled the utility to achieve excellent market penetration levels 
however  during the high gas prices experienced in the heating season temporarily eroded the price advantage 
arkansas western has made progress in regaining price advantage in its markets as gas prices have declined from the levels experienced in the winter of 
table of contents arkansas western filed an application with the apsc on november   for a rate increase of million annually 
in the third quarter of we received regulatory approval from the apsc of a rate increase totaling million annually  exclusive of costs to be recovered through arkansas western s purchase gas adjustment clause 
the order also entitled arkansas western to recover certain additional costs totaling million through its purchase gas adjustment clause over a two year period 
the rate increase was effective for all customer bills rendered on or after october  arkansas western s last rate increase was approved in december for its northwest region and in december for its northeast region 
the apsc approved increases of million and million  respectively 
the two operating regions have since been combined into one 
the difference between the million rate adjustment requested by arkansas western and the rate adjustment contained in the approved order primarily results from a reduction in arkansas western s requested return on equity and a change in arkansas western s assumed capital structure 
in the rate increase request that was filed with the apsc  we assumed an allowed return on equity of and a capital structure of debt and equity 
the final order provided for an allowed return on equity of and an assumed capital structure of debt and equity 
the equity return is in line with the equity return approved in recent settlements that have been approved for the other two arkansas local gas distribution companies 
rate increase requests  which may be filed in the future  will depend on customer growth  increases in operating expenses  and additional investment in property  plant and equipment 
in february  the apsc approved a day temporary tariff to collect additional gas costs not yet billed to customers through the utility s normal purchased gas adjustment clause in its approved tariffs 
we had significant under recovered purchased gas costs as a result of the high prices paid for gas supply in the heating season 
the temporary tariff allowed the utility accelerated recovery of these gas costs 
in april  arkansas western filed a revised purchased gas adjustment clause that provides better matching between the time the gas costs are incurred and the time the costs are recovered 
the apsc approved the new clause in may in april  the apsc adopted natural gas procurement plan rules for utilities 
these rules require utilities to take all reasonable and prudent steps necessary to develop a diversified gas supply portfolio 
the portfolio should consist of an appropriate combination of different types of gas purchase contracts and or financial hedging instruments that are designed to yield an optimum balance of reliability  reduced volatility and reasonable price 
utilities are also required to submit on an annual basis their gas supply plan  along with their contracting and or hedging objectives  to the staff of the apsc for review and determination as to whether it is consistent with these policy principles 
if the plan includes a hedging strategy and it is determined to be consistent with the objectives of the policy principles  utilities will be allowed to flow any hedging gain or loss to customers through the purchased gas adjustment clause 
during  arkansas western submitted its annual gas supply plan for the heating season and a revision to its purchased gas adjustment clause for the recovery of hedging gains and losses to the staff of the apsc 
in may and april  arkansas western submitted its annual gas supply plan for the and heating seasons 
arkansas western also purchases gas from unaffiliated producers under take or pay contracts 
we believe that we do not have a significant exposure to liabilities resulting from these contracts and expect to be able to continue to satisfactorily manage our exposure to take or pay liabilities 
marketing and transportation marketing year ended december  revenues in millions operating income in millions gas volumes marketed bcf our operating income from natural gas marketing was million on revenues of million in  compared to million on revenues of million in and million on revenues of million in the increase in revenues in resulted from higher prices received for gas sold and was offset by a corresponding increase in gas purchase expense 
we marketed bcf in  compared to bcf in and bcf in the decline in total volumes marketed in and resulted primarily from the decline in volumes marketed to third parties 
this reduction reflects our continued focus on marketing our own production and limiting the marketing of third party volumes in an effort to reduce our credit risk 
of the total volumes marketed  production from our exploration and production 
table of contents subsidiaries accounted for in  in and in we enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks and note to the financial statements for additional discussion 
transportation our marketing group also manages our interest in noark 
at december   arkansas western had transportation contracts with ozark pipeline for mmcf per day of firm capacity 
these contracts are renewable annually until terminated with days notice 
noark and arkansas western are currently renegotiating these contracts 
we recorded pre tax income from operations related to our noark investment of million in  compared to pre tax losses of million in and million in these amounts are recorded in other income expense in our income statement 
the pre tax gain in included a gain of million recognized on the sale of a mile portion of noark s pipeline located in oklahoma that had limited strategic value to the overall system 
the trend in improved operating results has been primarily caused by noark s ability to collect higher transportation rates on interruptible volumes 
we believe that we will be able to continue to improve noark s operating results and expect our investment in noark to be realized over the life of the system 
we refer you to note to the financial statements for additional discussion 
we have severally guaranteed the debt service on a portion of noark s outstanding debt 
noark s outstanding debt was million at december   and our share of the guarantee was million 
this debt financed a portion of the original cost to construct the noark pipeline 
we were not required to advance any funds to noark in and  but we advanced million in primarily for debt service 
we refer you to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements and note to the financial statements for further discussion of our guarantee of noark debt 
interest expense interest costs  net of capitalization  were down in and down in  both as compared to prior years 
the decreases in interest costs were due to both comparatively lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates 
in  our average borrowings again decreased as net proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock in the first quarter of were initially used to pay down our revolving credit facility 
we are reborrowing the repaid amounts under the credit facility  as necessary  to fund the acceleration of the development of our overton field in east texas and for general corporate purposes 
interest capitalized increased in and decreased in changes in capitalized interest are primarily due to the level of costs excluded from amortization in our e p segment 
income taxes our provision for deferred income taxes was an effective rate of in  in and in the changes in the provision for deferred income taxes recorded each year result primarily from the level of taxable income  the collection of under recovered purchased gas costs  abandoned property costs  and the deduction of intangible drilling costs in the year incurred for tax purposes  netted against the turnaround of intangible drilling costs deducted for tax purposes in prior years 
intangible drilling costs are capitalized and amortized over future years for financial reporting purposes under the full cost method of accounting 
pension expense we recorded pension expense of million in  million in and a credit to expense of million in the amount of pension expense recorded by us is determined by actuarial calculations and is also impacted by the funded status of our plans 
during  we funded our pension plan with contributions of million 
at december   our pension plans were underfunded and a liability of million was recorded on the balance sheet 
as a result of the underfunded status and actuarial data to be completed in early  we expect to record pension expense of million to million in for further discussion of our pension plans  we refer you to note to the financial statements and critical accounting policies below 
other revenues revenues and operating income in included pre tax gains of million related to the sale of real estate and certain property and equipment  and million of pre tax gain related to the sale of gas in storage inventory 

table of contents adoption of accounting principle statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas  was adopted by the company on january  fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
fas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made  and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the effect of this standard on our results of operations and financial condition at adoption was an increase in current and long term liabilities of million and million  respectively  a net increase in property  plant and equipment of million  a cumulative effect of adoption expense of million and a deferred tax asset of million 
as of december   we had million of current liabilities and million of long term liabilities associated with our asset retirement obligations 
subsequent to adoption  we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our future financial position or our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on internally generated funds and our unsecured revolving credit facilities discussed below under financing requirements as our primary sources of liquidity 
we may borrow up to million under our new revolving credit facilities from time to time 
as of february   we had million of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facilities 
during we expect to draw on a portion of the funds available under our credit facilities to fund our planned capital expenditures discussed below under capital expenditures for which are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations 
in december  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec pursuant to which we may from time to time  subject to market conditions  publicly offer equity  debt or other securities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in and million in the primary components of cash generated from operations are net income  depreciation  depletion and amortization  the provision for deferred income taxes and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash from operating activities increased in due primarily to increased net income and the related increase in deferred income taxes 
in  million of the million of cash provided by operating activities resulted from changes in our operating assets caused by the collection of accounts receivable and under recovered purchased gas costs that resulted from the extremely high gas prices that were in effect at the end of net cash from operating activities provided of our cash requirements for capital expenditures in  in and over in our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon market prices that we receive for our gas and oil production 
the price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities  as more fully discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks and note to the financial statements 
natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations 
as a result  we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations 
we adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon cash flow available 
capital expenditures capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in in  capital expenditures for our e p segment include million of accrued expenditures 
additionally  our e p segment expenditures included acquisitions of interests in natural gas and oil producing properties totaling million in  million in and million in our reported capital investments for  and include the gross expenditures in the overton field partnership discussed previously 
the owner of the minority interest in the overton partnership funded million and million of our e p expenditures during and  respectively 
in thousands exploration and production    gas distribution    other   
table of contents our capital investments planned for total million  consisting of million for exploration and production  million for gas distribution system improvements and million for general purposes 
we expect that this level of capital investments in will allow us to accelerate the development of our overton field properties in east texas  maintain our present markets  explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties  generate new drilling prospects  and provide for improvements necessary due to normal customer growth in our gas distribution segment 
as discussed above  our capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facilities 
we may adjust the level of capital investments dependent upon our level of cash flow generated from operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed above in results of operations  we hold a general partnership interest in noark  which owns the ozark pipeline that is utilized to transport our gas production and the gas production of others 
we account for our investment under the equity method of accounting 
we and the other general partner of noark have severally guaranteed the principal and interest payments on noark s notes due this debt financed a portion of the original cost to construct the noark pipeline 
our share of the guarantee is and we are allocated of the interest expense 
at december  and  the outstanding principal amount of these notes was million and million  respectively 
our share of the guarantee was million and million  respectively 
the notes were issued in june and require semi annual principal payments of million 
under the several guarantee  we are required to fund our share of noark s debt service which is not funded by operations of the pipeline 
we were not required to advance any funds to noark in and  and advanced million in we do not derive any liquidity  capital resources  market risk support or credit risk support from our investment in noark 
our share of the results of operations included in other income expense related to our noark investment was pre tax income of million in  and pre tax losses of million in and million in in  our share of pre tax income included a gain of million related to the sale of a mile portion of noark s pipeline system in oklahoma 
the improvement in operating results in and resulted primarily from the ability to collect higher transportation rates on interruptible volumes 
we believe that we will be able to continue to improve the operating results of the noark project and expect our investment in noark to be realized over the life of the system see note of the financial statements for additional discussion 
noark s assets and liabilities as of december  and are as follows in thousands current assets   noncurrent assets   current liabilities   long term debt   partners capital   noark s results of operations for  and are summarized below in thousands operating revenues    pre tax income loss    contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities 
significant contractual obligations at december  are as follows 
table of contents contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year to years to years years in thousands long term debt   operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations demand charges      other obligations   we lease certain office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring through our utility segment has volumetric commitments for the purchase of gas under non cancelable competitive bid packages and non cancelable wellhead contracts 
volumetric purchase commitments at december  totaled bcf  comprised of bcf in less than one year  bcf in one to three years  bcf in three to five years and bcf in more than five years 
our volumetric purchase commitments are priced primarily at regional gas indices set at the first of each future month 
these costs are recoverable from the utility s end use customers 
our utility segment has commitments for approximately million of demand charges on non cancelable firm gas purchase and firm transportation agreements 
these costs are recoverable from the utility s end use customers 
our e p segment has a commitment for approximately million of demand transportation charges 
our significant other contractual obligations include approximately million for funding of benefit plans  approximately million of land leases  approximately million for drilling rig commitments and approximately million of various information technology support and data subscription agreements 
we refer you to financing requirements below for a discussion of the terms of our long term debt 
contingent liabilities and commitments we have the following commitments and contingencies that could create  increase or accelerate our liabilities 
substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
our return on the assets of these plans in was negative which  combined with other factors  resulted in an increase in pension expense and our required funding of the plans for at december  we recorded an accrued pension benefit liability of million 
as a result of the underfunded status and actuarial data to be completed in early  we expect to record pension expense of million to million in see note to the financial statements and critical accounting policies below for additional information 
as discussed above in off balance sheet arrangements  we have guaranteed of the principal and interest payments on noark s notes due at december  the principal outstanding for these notes was million 
the notes require semi annual principal payments of million 
see note to the financial statements for additional information 
financing requirements our total debt outstanding was million at december  and million at december  in january  we entered into a new million three year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which replaced our previous million credit facility that was due to expire in july we also have access to an additional million of borrowing capacity under a separate three year unsecured credit facility entered into at the same time 
at december   we had million of outstanding debt under our prior revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on each of the new facilities is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently basis points over libor 
our publicly traded notes are rated bbb by standard and poor s and ba by moody s 
any downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase the cost of funds under our revolving credit facilities 
our revolving credit facilities contain covenants which impose certain restrictions on us 
under the credit agreements  we may not issue total debt in excess of of our total capital  must maintain a certain level of shareholders equity  and must maintain a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of or above 
additionally  there are certain limitations on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries 
we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements at december  although we do not anticipate debt covenant violations  our ability to comply with our 
table of contents debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as the market prices for natural gas and oil 
in  we publicly issued million of medium term notes due and million of medium term notes due in  we publicly issued million of notes due in in december  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the purpose of qualifying the potential sale from time to time of up to an aggregate million of equity  debt and other securities 
during the first quarter of  we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock under the shelf registration statement 
aggregate net proceeds from the equity offering of million were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility 
we are reborrowing the repaid amounts as necessary to fund the acceleration of the development of our overton field in east texas and for general corporate purposes 
in june  the noark partnership issued million of notes due the notes require semi annual principal payments of million that began in december we account for our investment in noark under the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the results of noark 
we and enogex  the other general partner of noark  have severally guaranteed the principal and interest payments on the noark debt 
our share of the several guarantee is and amounted to million at december  we did not advance any funds to noark in and and advanced million in if noark is unable to generate sufficient cash in the future to service its debt and we are required to contribute cash to fund our share of the debt service guarantee  we could be required to record our share of the noark debt commitment under current accounting rules 
at the end of  our capital structure consisted of debt excluding our several guarantee of noark s obligations and equity  with a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of 
ebitda is a measure required by our debt covenants and is defined as net income plus interest expense  income tax expense  and depreciation  depletion and amortization 
shareholders equity in the december  balance sheet includes an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million related to our hedging activities that is required to be recorded under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
this amount is based on current market values of our hedges at december   and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive when the hedges are ultimately settled  nor does it take into account revenues to be received ass ociated with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged 
our debt covenants as to capitalization percentages exclude the effects of non cash entries that result from fas as well as the non cash impact of any full cost ceiling write downs  and include the guarantee of noark s obligations 
our capital structure  including our several guarantee of noark s obligations  would be debt and equity at december  without consideration of the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to fas as part of our strategy to insure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations  we have hedged approximately of our expected gas production and of our expected oil production 
the amount of long term debt we incur is dependent upon commodity prices and our capital expenditure plans 
if commodity prices remain at or near current levels throughout and our capital expenditure plans do not change from current expectations  we will increase our long term debt in if c ommodity prices significantly decrease  we may modify our capital expenditure plans 
we refer you to business overview other items reconciliation of non gaap measures in item of part i of this form k for a table that reconciles ebitda with our net income as derived from our audited financial information 
working capital we maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet seasonal requirements through our credit facilities described above 
we had positive working capital of million at the end of and million at the end of current assets increased by in and current liabilities increased 
the increase in current assets at december  was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and gas in storage inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable was caused by higher gas prices realized for sales made at the end of  as compared to the end of current gas in storage increased due to injections made during the summer of for anticipated use during the heating season 
the increase in current liabilities was due to an increase in accounts payable related to both amounts owed other interest owners for their share of gas and oil sales collected by us and to our increased level of capital investments in our e p segment 

table of contents critical accounting policies natural gas and oil properties we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties 
we review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the sec on a quarterly basis 
under these rules  all such costs productive and nonproductive are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  however  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
if the net capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceed the ceiling  we will record a ceiling test write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
if r equired  it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons  even if temporary  increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
based on natural gas and oil prices in effect on december   the unamortized cost of our natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves 
natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any significant declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods 
natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
the uncertainties inherent in the disclosure are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we engage the services of an independent petroleum consulting firm to review reserves as estimated by our reservoir engineers 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  were issued in june and became effective for the company on july   and january   respectively 
the company understands the majority of the oil and natural gas industry did not change accounting and disclosures for mineral interest use rights leasehold acquisition costs upon the implementation of fas and however  an interpretation of fas and is being considered as to whether mineral interest use rights in gas and oil properties are intangible assets 
under this interpretation mineral interest use rights for both undeveloped and developed leaseholds would be classified as intangible assets  separate from gas and oil properties 
the classification as an intangible asset would not affect how these item s are accounted for under the full cost method of accounting with respect to the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization or the calculation of the ceiling test of gas and oil properties 
this interpretation would not affect our results of operations or cash flows 
at december  and  the company had undeveloped leasehold of approximately million and million  respectively  that would be classified as intangible undeveloped leasehold if this interpretation were applied 
southwestern also had developed leasehold of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  that would be classified as intangible developed leasehold if it applied the interpretation currently being considered 
the portion of developed leasehold that would be reclassified represents the costs of developed leaseholds acquired or transferred to the full cost pool subsequent to june   the effective date of fas additionally  fas requires that certain disclosures be made for all intangible assets 
the company has not made the disclosures set forth under fas related to the use rights of mineral interests 
southwestern will continue to classify the use rights of mineral interests in gas and oil properties as gas and oil properties until further guidance is provided 
hedging we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates 
our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings 
the primary 
table of contents market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged 
our derivative instruments are accounted for under fas and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements 
we utilize market based quotes from our hedge counterparties to value these open positions 
these valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and  to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production or interest rates  the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income 
results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases 
results of settled interest rate hedges are reflected in interest expense 
any ineffective hedge  derivative not qualifying for accounting treatment as a hedge  or ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized immediately in earnings 
future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements 
we refer you to qua ntitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this form k for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
regulated utility operations our utility operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the apsc 
allocations of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from those generally applied by non regulated operations 
such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities provided that there is a demonstrated ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates 
during the ratemaking process  the regulatory commission may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred 
this allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery 
this causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates 
the regulatory commission has not required any unbundling of services  although large industrials are free to contract for their own gas supply 
there are no regulations relating to unbundling of services currently anticipated  however  should such regulation be proposed and adopted  certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for deferred recognition and  accordingly  a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required 
pension and other postretirement benefits we record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost  as well as our periodic benefit cost  for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation see note to the financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans 
two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate  which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled  and the expected return on plan assets  which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
for  the discount rate assumed is and the expected return assumed is 
this compares to a discount rate of and an expected return of used in using the assumed rates discussed above  we recorded pension expense of million in and million in we reflected a pension liability of million at december  and million at december  during  we also funded million to our pension plan 
in  we expect to fund million to our pension plans 
assuming a change in the rates lower discount rate and lower rate of return  we would have recorded pension expense of million in gas in underground storage we record our gas stored in inventory that is owned by the e p segment at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
gas expected to be cycled within the next months is recorded in current assets with the remaining stored gas reflected as a long term asset 
the quantity and average cost of gas in storage was bcf at at december  and bcf at at december  the gas in inventory for the e p segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segment s contractual commitments including delivery to customers of our gas distribution business  especially during periods of colder weather 
as a result  demand fees paid by the gas distribution segment to the e p segment  which are passed through to the utility s customers  are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage 
in determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas  we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in 
table of contents inventory 
declines in the future market price of natural gas could result in us writing down our carrying cost of gas in storage

table of contents reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the interpretation of that data by geological engineers 
in addition  the results of drilling  testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously 
if significant  these revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices  basis differentials and interest rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates 
the board of directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price and interest rate risks 
these policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings 
credit risks our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas 
no single customer accounts for greater than of accounts receivable at december  see the discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading below 
interest rate risk the following table provides information on our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents our debt obligations  principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
variable average interest rates reflect the rates in effect at december  for borrowings under our credit facility

these swaps and options include transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price or variable price for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price or fixed price based on a published index referred to as price swaps  transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices referred to as basis swaps  and the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls collars that provide a floor price below which the counterparty pays production hedge or receives gas purchase hedge funds equal to the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor  and a ceiling price above which we pay to production hedge or receive from gas purchase hedge the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling 
the primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties 
the counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks 
the credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are periodically reviewed to ensure limited credit risk exposure
