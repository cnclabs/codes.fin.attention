item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisition on july  briggs stratton corporation and its subsidiary  briggs stratton power products group  llc  acquired simplicity manufacturing  inc simplicity for million plus certain transaction related expenses 
simplicity designs  manufactures and markets a wide variety of premium yard and garden tractors  lawn tractors  riding mowers  snow throwers  attachments  and other lawn and garden products like rototillers and chipper shredders 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition 
the following management discussion and analysis does not include a discussion of simplicity s operating results because this transaction occurred subsequent to our fiscal year end 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal consolidated net sales were approximately billion  an increase of million  or compared to the previous year 
the improvement was driven primarily by increased sales volume in both segments 
engine segment net sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of million or compared to the prior year 
engine segment increases were driven by an increase in unit volume resulting in million in net sales 
million or of the increase in engine unit volume is attributable to sales to our power products segment 
lawn and garden sales volume gains were driven by a strong selling season at retail 
inventory levels were low at the major original equipment manufacturers going into this fiscal year 
as a result  the demand for engines was high all year long in anticipation of a strong season  which materialized 
we believe the volume increase is reflective of market growth and market penetration in the us while our european sales unit volume was down due to the drought conditions in europe during much of fiscal  the euro exchange rate drove a million increase in net sales 
power products net sales were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal generator volume benefited significantly by the wide spread power outages that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal  as a result of the eastern electrical grid failure and the landfall of a major hurricane 
there were no major power outages in fiscal these events  along with increased marketing efforts  increased consumer awareness which continued to drive the demand for generators higher in fiscal pressure washer net sales gains were driven by continued advertising and promotions at major retailers  consistent with programs launched in the prior year and increased placement at a major retailer 
gross profit consolidated gross profit increased million between years 
volume increases generated million of the improvement  with approximately million from increases in the engine segment and the remainder from the power products segment 
the remaining million of gross margin increases came from gross margin percentage improvements in the engine segment 
engine segment margins improved from to 
pricing improvement due to the impact of a stronger euro on european sales contributed million to the improvement 
a increase in production volume contributed million in absorption benefits and our manufacturing cost reduction programs contributed an additional million to the improvement 
these positive margin enhancers were partially offset by a million net increase in manufacturing costs  primarily overhead  raw materials and component costs 
these cost increases reflect initiatives by many vendors to pass along higher costs due to price pressures on scrap aluminum and steel 
we expect these cost increases to continue in fiscal we currently anticipate that our cost reduction programs and sales pricing initiatives should offset these higher costs 
the power products segment margin was at in both fiscal and fiscal a production volume improvement and manufacturing cost reduction efforts were offset by increased purchased component costs 
the power products segment purchases a major pressure washer component from a european supplier in euros 
in fiscal the euro purchases reduced gross margins of the power products segment by approximately million 
under the company s foreign currency management program  this negative impact on margins was offset by the positive impact of the euro discussed for the engine segment 

table of contents engineering  selling  general and administrative costs engineering  selling  general and administrative costs increased million or compared to fiscal increases in this category include salaries and fringe benefit cost increases of approximately million  professional services of million  marketing cost increases of million and international variable selling cost increases of million 
in addition  million of the increase is attributable to bad debt expense associated with a prior fiscal year customer bankruptcy 
the increases in salaries and fringe benefits reflect increased incentive compensation awards in the current year  as well as increased employee benefit costs  essentially pension and health care 
the increase in professional services is attributable to several consulting projects related to our distributor channels  emissions regulations and sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
increased marketing costs were driven by increased spending on power products market expansion and international marketing efforts 
increases in international variable selling costs include million attributable to translating euro denominated expenditures by a stronger euro 
interest expense interest expense decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is essentially the result of reduced working capital borrowings in the current year and the impact of a fixed to variable interest rate swap 
on march   the company called for the redemption of its million convertible senior notes due in substantially all of the holders of the notes exercised their conversion rights prior to the redemption date of may  this resulted in the issuance of approximately three million treasury shares in may and the write off of approximately million in deferred financing costs 
the redemption of these bonds eliminated all convertible debt and reduced our long term debt to approximately million 
the redemption will also eliminate approximately million in interest expense in fiscal in april  all interest rate swaps were terminated resulting in a net gain of approximately thousand 
other income other income remained at approximately million in fiscal  consistent with prior years 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for detail of the components of other income 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the rate reflects less of a benefit from foreign and state tax credits 
earnings from some of our foreign subsidiaries was down due to market conditions  while the domestic income contribution increased 
the impact of lower tax credits was offset by a reduction in the tax provision due to the closing of a tax audit year and recording additional tax benefits related to the filing of our fiscal income tax return 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal consolidated net sales were approximately billion  an increase of million  or compared to the previous year 
power products sales increased million  accounting for the majority of the increase 
generator sales increased million to million  up from million in fiscal marked the return of significant demand creating events such as hurricanes and ice storms after a two year absence of significant activity 
the generator market decreased significantly after the record demand created by the concern over year issues 
we do not believe this market to be mature and have developed marketing campaigns to increase brand awareness and drive purchase decisions 
we believe our efforts have generated demand resulting in increased household penetration 
our marketing efforts in fiscal included retailer specific flyers and promotions  national and regional advertising  and television and radio ads 
we believe the return of weather events and our cooperative promotional activities together resulted in the sales increase in fiscal pressure washer sales increased million to million  up from million in fiscal pressure washer sales also benefited from similar promotional campaigns  as described above 
the remainder of the consolidated sales increase was attributable to the engine segment 
improved engine unit volume resulted in a million sales increase and greater volume in component parts and international service sales provided another million sales increase 
the remainder of the increase was primarily price improvement on international sales  as a result of a stronger euro 
offsetting the engine segment improvements were million of increased sales to the power products segment that were eliminated in consolidation 
engine segment volume improvements were driven by market growth 

table of contents gross profit consolidated gross profit increased million over the previous year 
volume increases generated million of the improvement  with approximately million from volume increases in the engine segment and the remainder from the power products segment volume 
the remaining million of gross margin increases came from improvements in gross margin percentages in both business segments 
engines improved from to and power products improved from to 
the gross margin percentage change in engines resulted in approximately million of improvement to gross margins between years 
pricing improvement  primarily due to the impact on european sales of a stronger euro  contributed million to the improvement and net reductions in manufacturing costs and an increase in production volume each provided another million of gross margin improvement 
on an ongoing basis we challenge our operations group to lower our manufacturing costs in order to remain competitive in the marketplace 
historical areas of focus have been product engineering  labor productivity  controllable overhead spending  warranty and quality costs  as well as purchased component pricing 
while none of these items account for an individually significant portion of our savings  the net impact across our six production facilities was a reduction in cost of million 
the power products gross margin percentage increase of resulted in approximately million of improved gross margin 
a production volume increase was the primary driver of the improvement 
as previously discussed  an increase in weather related events and promotional activities increased demand for generators and pressure washers in fiscal the increased demand allowed us to increase production volume between years 
engineering  selling  general and administrative costs engineering  selling  general and administrative costs increased million or compared to fiscal increases in this category include salaries and fringe benefit cost increases of approximately million  marketing cost increases of million and international variable selling cost increases of million 
the increases in salaries and fringe benefits reflect increased incentive compensation awards in fiscal  as well as increased employee benefit costs  essentially pension and health care 
increased marketing costs were driven by increased spending on power products market expansion and international marketing efforts 
interest expense interest expense decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is essentially the result of reduced working capital borrowings in the current year and the impact of a fixed to variable interest rate swap 
other income other income remained at million in fiscal  consistent with prior years 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for detail as to the components of other income 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease is attributable to tax credits related to increased foreign sourced income 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years  and cash flows from operating activities were million  million and million  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal cash flow from operating activities were million lower than the prior year 
fiscal experienced a significant increase in inventory levels  which reduced cash flows from operating activities by million in fiscal and million between years 
engine inventories increased million between years 
this increase is attributable to strong production levels through the end of the fiscal year driven by a strong selling season at retail 
in addition we believe that the increased inventory is needed to meet our forecast for fiscal our power products segment also experienced an increase in inventory levels of million between years 
this increase in inventory reflects strong production levels throughout the year in order to replenish depleted inventories after the demand creating events for generators in the current year 
the current 
table of contents inventory levels reflect our judgment of levels needed to maintain our position as the market leader in responsiveness to customer demand 
pressure washer inventory levels reflect increasing demand for the product due to significant market growth in the category 
inventory on hand will always reflect demand and our ability to respond to market changes at our production facilities in a timely manner 
also contributing to the lower cash flows from operating activities were increased receivables growth between years of million  which reflects our sales growth at both segments and timing of payments  lower payable increases between years of million and lower deferred tax provisions between years of million 
offsetting these reductions in cash flows were increased earnings of million  a reduction in prepaid expenses between years of million and lower pension income of million 
the fiscal cash flow from operating activities was million lower than the prior year 
fiscal did not experience the significant reduction in inventory investment experienced in fiscal  which caused cash flows to be million less between years 
inventory levels are a function of planned production levels based on anticipated demand  contrasted with actual sell through of product at retail 
in fiscal the market was soft resulting in lower than anticipated sales for the year and increased inventory levels throughout the channel 
as a result of the unusually high inventory levels at the end of fiscal  we lowered our planned production in the lawn and garden selling season was strong  and we were successful in getting our inventory levels back to a level we considered normal 
the fiscal selling season was also strong resulting in no significant change in our inventory levels 
offsetting this reduction in cash flow were improved cash flows related to increased earnings of million  a lower accounts receivable increase between years of million and higher current liabilities of million 
accounts receivable levels increased in fiscal because of strong fourth quarter sales versus the prior year 
sales strength in the fourth quarter was similar between fiscal and resulting in an accounts receivable balance that did not change significantly 
current liabilities  primarily accruals for profit sharing were greater between years because better performance in fiscal resulted in larger bonus awards than the prior year 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash flows include capital expenditures of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these capital expenditures relate primarily to reinvestment in equipment  capacity additions and new products 
in fiscal  briggs stratton received million as a refund of a portion of the cash paid for the bsppg acquisition in fiscal the amount was to adjust the original purchase price for the actual value received in acquired receivables and inventory 
in fiscal  briggs stratton increased its investment in its china joint venture from to 
this increase in ownership interest gave briggs stratton control over the joint venture 
accordingly  its operating results are now reflected in briggs stratton s consolidated financial statements 
the actual cash outlay in fiscal for the restructuring was thousand  however  the consolidation resulted in an increase in cash of approximately million 
briggs stratton provided cash from financing activities totaling million in fiscal briggs stratton used cash in financing activities totaling million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal the company received million from the exercise of stock options as opposed to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the stock option activity is a direct reflection of option strike prices  which encouraged the exercise of the options 
during fiscal the company paid down million of its short term loans and notes payable 
these loans were primarily used to fund the short term working capital needs of briggs stratton s foreign operations 
given the level of cash flows the last two fiscal years and the available cash on hand  briggs stratton made the decision to pay off these borrowings and fund these operations with available cash 
briggs stratton did not use its revolver to finance working capital needs during fiscal in fiscal briggs stratton also incurred million to negotiate a new revolving credit agreement 
during fiscal briggs stratton repaid million of its senior notes due in future liquidity and capital resources as previously noted  briggs stratton acquired simplicity manufacturing  inc in july of fiscal  using its available cash 
we don t believe the acquisition of simplicity will significantly alter our future liquidity and capital needs given its profitability and existing receivable financing arrangements 

table of contents briggs stratton has negotiated a new five year million revolving credit facility that expires in may this credit facility will be used to fund seasonal working capital requirements and other financing needs 
this facility and briggs stratton s other indebtedness contain certain restrictive covenants described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
because of our financial strength we were able to negotiate less restrictive covenants under the new revolving credit facility  specifically the covenants do not include the springing lien provisions of our previous credit facility 
briggs stratton expects capital expenditures to be million in fiscal these anticipated expenditures reflect our plans to continue to reinvest in equipment  new products  and capacity enhancements 
management believes that available cash  the credit facility  cash generated from future operations  existing lines of credit and access to debt markets will be adequate to fund briggs stratton s capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
financial strategy management believes that the value of briggs stratton is enhanced if the capital invested in operations yields a cash return that is greater than the cost of capital 
consequently  management s first priority is to reinvest capital into physical assets and products that maintain or grow the global cost leadership and market positions that briggs stratton has achieved  and drive the economic value of the company 
management s next financial objective is to identify strategic acquisitions or alliances that enhance revenues and provide a superior economic return 
several successful joint ventures and the acquisition of bsppg are examples of our successful execution of this strategy 
finally  management believes that when capital cannot be invested for returns greater than the cost of capital  we should return capital to the capital providers 
this approach is apparent in the programs we executed to repurchase common stock from fiscal through off balance sheet arrangements briggs stratton has no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties not fully recorded in our balance sheets or fully disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
briggs stratton s significant contractual obligations include our debt agreements and certain employee benefit plans 
briggs stratton is subject to financial and operating restrictions in addition to certain financial covenants under its domestic debt agreements 
as is fully disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  these restrictions could limit our ability to pay dividends  incur further indebtedness  create liens  enter into sale and or leaseback transactions  consolidate  sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets  and dispose of assets or the proceeds of our assets 
we believe we will remain in compliance with these covenants in fiscal briggs stratton has obligations concerning certain employee benefits including its pension plans  post retirement benefit obligations and deferred compensation arrangements 
all of these obligations are recorded on our balance sheets and disclosed more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations a summary of the company s expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of june  is as follows in thousands thereafter total long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases as of june   the company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property  plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than days 
the company also has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in note to the financial statements 
as of its most recent actuarial measurement date  no pension plan contributions are required in fiscal  and postretirement medical claims are paid as they are submitted 
other matters early retirement incentive program in the second quarter of fiscal  briggs stratton offered and finalized an early retirement incentive program 
the net reduction in the global salaried workforce was approximately 

table of contents the impact for fiscal year was a reduction in net income on an after tax basis of million  after consideration of approximately million in savings for lower salary related expenditures 
the majority of the impact on net income was the result of recognizing the cost of the special termination benefits  which reduced net periodic pension income 
labor agreement briggs stratton has collective bargaining agreements with its unions 
these agreements expire in for the engines segment and in for the power products segment 
emissions the us environmental protection agency epa has developed national emission standards under a two phase process for small air cooled engines 
briggs stratton currently has a complete product offering which complies with the epa s phase i engine emission standards 
the phase ii program imposes more stringent standards over the useful life of the engine and is being phased in through for class ii or greater cubic centimeter displacement engines and through for class i under cubic centimeter displacement engines 
the majority of briggs stratton s engines are certified to be compliant with the epa s phase ii standards 
accordingly  briggs stratton does not believe compliance with the new standards will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
epa is also evaluating the development of phase iii standards to further reduce engine exhaust emissions and to control evaporative emissions from small off road engines and equipment they are used in 
a draft regulation is scheduled for publication by the end of calendar year we cannot predict the scope of any proposal or of the final regulations that epa may ultimately adopt  and accordingly cannot estimate what  if any  impact such regulations could have on future financial performance 
the california air resources board carb staff issued a revised proposed tier regulation requiring additional reductions to engine exhaust emissions and also requiring new controls on evaporative emissions from small engines 
the carb staff proposal is phased in between and depending upon the size of the engine and type of control 
while briggs stratton believes the cost of the proposed regulation on a per engine basis may be significant  briggs stratton does not believe the carb staff proposal will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
this assessment is based on a number of factors  including the bond amendment which precludes other states from opting into the california standard  revisions carb made to its proposal from that published in september in response to recommendations from briggs stratton and others in the regulated category  the fact that california represents a relatively small percentage of briggs stratton s engine sales and our ability and intention to pass increased costs associated with the carb regulation on to california consumers 
the european commission adopted an engine emission directive regulating exhaust emissions from engines manufactured by briggs stratton 
the european directive parallels the regulation previously promulgated by the us epa  therefore  briggs stratton anticipates having a full product line offering which complies with stage i and ii of the directive 
briggs stratton does not believe compliance with the new directive will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies briggs stratton s critical accounting policies are more fully described in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the recovery of accounts receivable and inventory reserves  as well as those used in the determination of liabilities related to customer rebates  pension obligations  postretirement benefits  warranty  product liability  litigation and taxation 

table of contents the reserves for customer rebates  warranty  product liability  inventory reserves and doubtful accounts are fact specific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations  historical experience  and current and expected economic conditions 
changes in these reserves may be required if actual experience differs from the original estimates 
the company s estimate of income taxes payable  deferred income taxes  and the effective tax rate is based on a complex analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal  state and foreign income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions  and current accounting standards 
we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 
in addition  federal  state and foreign taxing authorities periodically review the corporation s estimates and interpretation of income tax laws 
adjustments to the effective income tax rate and recorded assets and liabilities may occur in future periods if actual results differ significantly from original estimates and interpretations 
the pension benefit obligation and related pension income are calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance 
actuarial valuations at june  used a discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
a decrease in the discount rate would decrease annual pension income by approximately million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease our annual pension income by approximately million 
the other postretirement benefits obligation and related expense charge are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the health care trend rate 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the service and interest cost by thousand 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point  would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by million and decrease the service and interest cost by thousand
