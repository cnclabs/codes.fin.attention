item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the earnings performance and financial condition of the company with a primary focus on an analysis of operating results 
current performance does not guarantee and may not be indicative of similar performance in the future 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s strategic plan provides for a highly profitable financial services company within the markets it serves 
specifically  management is focused on increased market penetration in selected geographic areas  and achieving excellence in both retail and commercial lines of business 
the acquisitions of firstservice bank in first quarter and hometowne heritage bank in fourth quarter  the sale of panasia bank  na in third quarter  and the pending acquisition of peoples first  inc and its subsidiary  the peoples bank of oxford in the second quarter  represent strategic initiatives by the company in furtherance of its focused goals 
the financial information presented in this management s discussion and analysis has been restated as a result of the sale of panasia which is presented as discontinued operations under sfas no 
the financial results exclude panasia in the current year  and in   and this presentation is intended to aid comparison of current year results with future results 
the current economic climate and interest rate environment present challenges for all financial institutions in achieving their business goals 
during this low interest rate environment  the company pursued strategic balance sheet opportunities 
in september  the company o refinanced million in long term federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  incurring a prepayment fee of million after taxes of million  under the terms of the fhlb borrowing agreements 
the company lowered interest expense associated with borrowings from the federal home loan bank by basis points and will enjoy lower borrowing costs for the next six years as a result of this transaction 
o sold approximately million in investment securities available for sale resulting in an after tax loss of  this transaction allowed npbc to re deploy those funds into higher yielding investments 
in addition to historical information  this form k contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements in this document are subject to risks and uncertainty 
forward looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations by the company 
when we use words such as believe  expect  anticipate  or similar expressions  we are making forward looking statements 
additional information concerning forward looking statements is contained in this form k at item business under the caption forward looking statements  which information is incorporated by reference into this management s discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and predominant practice within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and the assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss given default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  mortgages  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
with the adoption of sfas no 
on january   the company discontinued the amortization of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
goodwill is now subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
the company tests for impairment based on the goodwill maintained at each defined reporting unit 
a fair value is determined for each reporting unit based on at least one of three various market valuation methodologies 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less  an expense may be required on the company s books to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
as of june   the company completed its testing which determined that no impairment write offs were necessary 
no other events occurred since the annual test completed june  to require additional impairment tests during no assurance can be given that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realization is more likely than not 
if management determines that the company may be unable to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  a direct charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the recorded value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable amount 
financial condition the company completed the cash sale of its subsidiary panasia bank  na  for million on september  this transaction is presented in the financial statements as discontinued operations 
the sale resulted in a gain of million after taxes of million 
at the time of the sale  panasia had total assets of million  net loans of million  and marketable securities of million 
panasia s deposits totaled million  it had no other borrowings 
panasia s total equity was million 
net income from discontinued operations  net of income tax expense of million for the year ended december  was million 
the financial information presented in this management s discussion and analysis has been restated as a result of the sale of panasia which is presented as discontinued operations under sfas no 
the financial results exclude panasia in the current year  and in   and this presentation is intended to aid comparison of current year results with future results 
at december   total assets were billion  an increase of million or from the billion at december  the increase in total assets excluding panasia s assets of million at december  was million 
the increase in assets in is reflected primarily in the loan category  the investment category and the goodwill and other intangibles category  which increased million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in assets as of december  is primarily due to the acquisition of firstservice bank on february  and hometowne heritage bank on december   which had million and million in assets  respectively  at time of acquisition 
total assets at the end of increased million or over the billion at year end loan portfolio net loans and leases  including loans held for sale  increased to billion during  an increase of million or compared to net loans increased million in or 
compared to the company gained million in net loans due to the addition of firstservice bank and million in net loans from the addition of hometowne heritage bank 
the company sold million in manufactured housing loans in april substantially all such loans  which the company had ceased originating in and securitized approximately million in residential mortgages into mortgage backed securities in second and fourth quarters the company does not retain the servicing on loans sold 
adjusting for these transactions  core loan growth was for the year ended december  loans continue to increase at a modest pace as a result of the overall slow economy and the lack of capital goods spending by the company s business customers 
residential mortgages originated for immediate resale during the year ended december  amounted to million 
the company has million in loans held for sale at december  at december  the company had no significant exposure to energy and agricultural related loans 
the company s loans are widely diversified by borrower  industry group  and geographical area in southeastern pennsylvania 
the following summary shows the year end composition of the company s loan portfolio december  in thousands commercial and industrial loans and leases      real estate loans construction and land dev 
     residential      other nonfarm  nonresidential      loans to individuals      total      maturities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates in certain loan categories in the company s loan portfolio at december   are summarized below after one year one year or less to five years after five years total in thousands commercial and industrial loans and leases     construction and land dev

in situations where a renewal is appropriate  the company s policy in this regard is to evaluate the credit for collectibility consistent with the normal loan evaluation process 
this policy is used primarily in evaluating ongoing customers use of their lines of credit that are at floating interest rates 
the company s outstanding lines of credit to customers total million 
risk elements loans a loan is placed in a nonaccrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
past due loans are those loans which were contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection 
restructured loans are those loans which terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the borrower

nonaccrual loans represented million and million at december   and december   respectively 
loans days past due and still accruing interest were  and  at december  and december   respectively 
additional discussion regarding this issue is set forth in the paragraph of this item titled allowance for loan losses on page other real estate owned was  at december  and  at december   respectively 
other real estate owned in was more typical of historical results 
the company had no restructured loans at december  or december  the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming assets was and at december  and december   respectively  with the increase in due to the decreased level of nonperforming assets discussed above 
another measure of the company s credit quality is reflected by the ratio of net chargeoffs to total loans of for versus for the year  and the ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans of 
at december   compared to 
at december  net loan chargeoffs of million during was typical compared to historical company results and peer averages 
of the million in net chargeoffs  million were commercial and industrial loans 
the company has not engaged in any transactions with entities established and operated by former members of senior management or individuals with former management relationships with the company 
investment portfolio investments  which are the company s secondary use of funds  increased million or to million at year end this increase was partially offset by investment sales  calls and maturities of million and the amortization of mortgage backed securities 
the increase in is due to three factors  investment purchases of million primarily in mortgage backed securities and municipals  which included the securitization of approximately million of conforming residential loans through federal home loan mortgage corporation during the second and fourth quarters  and the additional of firstservice bank s investment portfolio of million on february  hometowne s investment portfolio totaled million at the time of the acquisition 
the residential mortgage securitizations resulted in the transfer of assets from the company s loan portfolio to the investment portfolio where they are now held in the form of a mortgage backed security 
the purpose of these transactions was to provide greater liquidity for the loans as they are more readily saleable in the form of a security  as well as to provide collateral for the company s cash management and municipal deposit programs 
in  the investment portfolio reflected an increase of million or compared to the increase in was due to the addition of million primarily in mortgage backed securities  which were partially offset by calls and maturities of securities  investment securities sales and payments on mortgage backed securities

results of operations the financial information presented in this management s discussion and analysis has been restated as a result of the sale of panasia which is presented as discontinued operations under sfas no 
the financial results exclude panasia in the current year  and in   and this presentation is intended to aid comparison of current year results with future results 
the company recorded a net income increase in the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  diluted earnings per share increased 
or for the year ended december  to per share from in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  the difference in the change in the percentage increase in net income when compared to the percentage increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the larger number of weighted average common shares outstanding  principally resulting in the issuance of  shares of commons stock for the acquisition of firstservice bank which was completed on february  net income for of million was more than the million reported in on a per share basis  basic earnings were  and for   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the return on average shareholders equity and return on average assets were and compared to and for the decrease in return on shareholders equity in is due to the increase in weighted average common shares outstanding 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on assets and interest expense on liabilities 
net interest income increased million or to million in from the amount of million 
interest income increased million as a result of increased loan income of million offset by an decrease in investment income and income from federal funds sold and deposits in banks of  and  respectively 
interest expense decreased million or to million in from the amount of million due to a decrease of million in interest on deposits and a decrease of million in interest on borrowed funds 
despite the current low rate environment  the cost of attracting and holding deposited funds is an ever increasing expense in the banking industry 
these increases are the real costs of deposit accumulation and retention  including fdic insurance costs  marketing and branch overhead expenses 
such costs are necessary for continued growth and to maintain and increase market share of available deposits 
the company s interest rate margin decreased slightly from in to in due to the historically low interest rate environment 
the pricing of liabilities is near a floor  however  assets continue to reprice at these low interest rate levels 
the following table shows  on a taxable equivalent basis  the changes in the company s net interest income  by category  due to shifts in volume and rate  for the years ended december  and the information is presented on a taxable equivalent basis  using an effective tax rate of in thousands

the change in interest due to both rate and volume is allocated to rate and volume changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
the above rate volume table demonstrates the downward pricing pressure of our assets as our interest income dropped million due to changes in rate  while the cost of funds interest expense only dropped million 
allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is determined by periodic reviews of loan quality  current economic conditions  loss experience and loan growth 
based on these factors  the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  and million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses of million at year end and million at year end as a percentage of total loans was at year end and at year end net loan chargeoffs of million in were typical compared to historical company results 
chargeoffs of million during were high compared to historical company results and peer averages and were driven by two large commercial real estate credits  while the million in chargeoffs during were typical compared to historical company results 
to strengthen national penn bank s credit administration process  national penn bank enhanced its lending policies  and allocated additional resources to oversee its underwriting procedures in management continues to believe its loan loss allowance is adequate to cover losses inherent in the current portfolio 
a detailed analysis of the company s allowance for loan losses for the five years ended december   is shown below december  balance at beginning of year      charge offs commercial and industrial loans and leases      real estate loans construction and land development   residential     other   loans to individuals     total charge offs      recoveries commercial and industrial  real estate loans construction and land development residential other  loans to individuals total recoveries      net charge offs      provision charged to expense      adjustments changes incident to mergers and absorptions  net  balance at end of year      ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period commercial and industrial loans  real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all or part of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
loans to individuals are charged off any time repayment is deemed highly unlikely or as soon as the loan becomes days delinquent 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level deemed sufficient to absorb losses  which are inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific reserve for doubtful or high risk loans  an allocated reserve based on historical trends  and an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
the specific reserve for high risk loans is established for specific commercial and industrial loans  real estate development loans  and construction loans which have been identified by bank management as being high risk loan assets 
these high risk loans are assigned a doubtful risk rating grade because the loan has not performed according to payment terms and there is reason to believe that repayment of the loan principal in whole or part is unlikely 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for these individual doubtful loans 
to assist in determining the fair value of loan collateral  the company often utilizes independent third party qualified appraisal firms which in turn employ their own criteria and assumptions that may include occupancy rates  rental rates  and property expenses  among others 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding and commitments that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial loans  real estate development and construction loans  and for the various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes or any other factor  which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
before applying the historical loss experience percentages  loan balances are reduced by the portion of the loan balances  if any  which are subject to a guarantee by a government agency 
the company also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed  these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information  which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
at december   management believes that the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels during the review of the allowance for loan losses  the company considers a variety of factors that include economic conditions and market volatility  the continued concern that a slow economy results in operating losses for the company s commercial customers  and the overall concerns of consumer confidence  including international concerns 
despite these concerns  the reduction in charge offs in compared to allowed the company to reduce its provision for loan and lease losses while maintaining the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level believed adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans 
the following table shows how the allowance for loan losses is allocated among the various types of loans that the company has outstanding 
this allocation is based on management s specific review of the credit risk of the outstanding loans in each category as well as historical trends

the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
other income and expenses other income increased million or in compared to  as a result of increased service charges on deposit accounts of million  increased other service charges and fees  including cash management  of million  and increased insurance commissions and fees of million 
the increase in deposit fees is due primarily to an increase in the collections of fees on a larger deposit base  resulting from the firstservice acquisition 
the increase in insurance commission and fees is due largely to the addition of firstservice insurance agency inc  which contributed million of the total million in insurance income 
the company received income in of million related to a merger of a mutual insurance company which is the issuer of certain life insurance policies held by the company  which accounts for much of the increase in other service charges and fees 
these increases to other income were offset by a decrease in bank owned life insurance income of  a decrease in mortgage banking income of  due to the slowdown in refinance volume in third and fourth quarters  and an increase in losses on sale of investment securities of  the increase in other income in compared to was million or as a result of increased service charges on deposits accounts of million  and increased mortgage banking income of million  increased other service charges and fees  including cash management  of  increased trust income of  and decreased net gains on sale of investment securities of  sales of investment securities in and totaled million and million  respectively 
other expenses increased million or in compared to as a result of increased salaries  wages and benefits of million  a million prepayment fee paid to the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh in the refinancing of long term debt  and increased other operating expenses of million 
salaries  wages and benefits increased due to normal salary increases and the addition of employees from the acquisition of firstservice as well as a contractual severance payment in december the increase in other operating expenses is also partially associated with the acquisition of firstservice  which included a community office network of seven offices  as well as three new proposed offices 
additional marketing expenses were attributable to additional advertising campaigns conducted in other expenses increased million or in when compared to  as a result of increased salaries  wages and benefits of million  and increased other expenses of million 
salaries  wages and benefits increased due to increased staff and increases in benefit costs 
for   and  there are no individual items of other operating expenses that exceed one percent of the aggregate of total interest income and other income  with the exception of advertising and marketing related expenses and the non recurring fhlb prepayment fee in income before income taxes from continuing operations increased  or in compared to  due primarily to the prepayment fee paid in the federal home loan bank long term debt refinancing

income taxes related to continuing operations increased  or in and income taxes related to continuing operations increased  in  or 
the company s effective tax rate is for  for  and for  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from to is due to the increase in tax advantaged income as a percent of taxable income 
the effective tax rate is less than the current incremental rate due to the company s investments in tax advantaged municipal securities and bank owned life insurance 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
these statements modify the company s accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
modifies the accounting for all purchased goodwill and intangible assets 
as of january   the company is no longer amortizing its goodwill 
had the company not been required to amortize goodwill  reported earnings per share would have been higher on a diluted basis or per share versus the per share actually reported for the year ended december  sfas no 
includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them 
the company will be testing goodwill for impairment at least annually 
for the testing completed as of june   the company had no impairment of goodwill 
no assurance can be given that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
in the past twelve to twenty four months  the company s liquidity has improved as people have removed money from the declining equity market 
during this time  many customers have preferred the safety of fdic insured deposits compared to the uncertain equity market  despite historically low interest rates 
this has allowed the company to grow its core deposit base and significantly reduce reliance on non core sources of funds 
the company s main liquidity concern is when the current environment reverses course that is  the economy and consequently the equity markets strengthen and the company suffers disintermediation back to the equity market 
the company is currently preparing for this potential disintermediation by working to build its share of customers banking business on the theory that even if some funds move back to the equity market  the company will still retain a larger share than it had two years ago  growing its government banking unit  reviewing its deposit product offerings  establishing additional non core sources of funding  maintaining a more liquid investment portfolio  and continuing to develop its capability to securitize assets 
the company s acquisitions of firstservice during the first quarter of and hometowne heritage during fourth quarter of did not have an immediate material impact on the company s current liquidity 
both firstservice and hometowne have retained their divisional titles and brand identification in their markets 
accordingly  the company expects no material run off in deposits over the long term  and as a result  does not anticipate a negative material impact on the company s overall long term liquidity position 
we do not expect that the acquisition of peoples first  inc will not affect our overall liquidity position  either positively or negatively 
peoples liquidity position is similar to our liquidity position 
funding affecting short term liquidity  including deposits  repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased  and short term borrowings increased million during long term borrowings decreased million during the following table shows separately the interest rate sensitivity of each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  repricing periods within three months one year over three through through five months one year five years years in thousands assets interest bearing deposits at banks  investment securities     loans and leases     other assets  liabilities and equity non interest bearing deposits  interest bearing deposits     borrowed funds    subordinated debt  other liabilities  hedging instruments   shareholders equity  interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap    adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid and are adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments based upon assumptions estimating the expected prepayments in the interest rate environment prevailing during the fourth calendar quarter of the table assumes prepayments and scheduled principal amortization of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities  and assumes that adjustable rate mortgages will reprice at contractual repricing intervals 
there has been no adjustment for the impact of future commitments and loans in process 
savings and now deposits are scheduled for repricing based on historical deposit decay rate analyses  as well as historical moving averages of run off for the company s deposits in these categories 
while generally subject to immediate withdrawal  management considers a portion of these accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities based upon the company s historical retention of such deposits in changing interest rate environments 
specifically  of these deposits are considered repriceable within three months and are considered repriceable in the over five year category 
includes federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  and short and long term borrowings 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
these characteristics include the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of the repricing  and the relative levels of repricing 
attempting to minimize the interest rate sensitivity gaps is a continual challenge in a changing rate environment 
based on the company s gap position as reflected in the above table  current accepted theory would indicate that net interest income would decrease in a falling interest rate environment and would increase in a rising interest rate environment 
an interest rate gap table does not  however  present a complete picture of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
first  changes in the general level of interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
second  assets and liabilities which can contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same time or to the same extent 
third  the table represents a one day position  variations occur daily as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year 
fourth  assumptions must be made to construct such a table 
for example  non interest bearing deposits are assigned a repricing interval of within three months  although history indicates a significant amount of these deposits will not move into interest bearing categories regardless of the general level of interest rates 
finally  the repricing distribution of interest sensitive assets may not be indicative of the liquidity of those assets 
gap analysis is a useful measurement of asset and liability management  however  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on this measure 
therefore  the company supplements gap analysis with the calculation of the economic value of equity 
this report forecasts changes in the company s market value of portfolio equity mvpe under alternative interest rate environments 
the mvpe is defined as the net present value of the company s existing assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
the calculated estimates of change in mvpe at december  are as follows mvpe change in interest rate amount change in thousands basis points  basis points  basis points  flat rate  basis points  basis points  basis points  management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the vulnerability of the company s earnings and capital to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on mvpe could vary substantially if different assumptions are used  such as or basis point changes in interest rates  or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
if the company should experience a mismatch in its desired gap ranges or an excessive decline in its mvpe subsequent to an immediate and sustained change in interest rate  it has a number of options which it could utilize to remedy such mismatch 
the company could restructure its investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes 
it could also emphasize loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes  or it could emphasize deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities 
the company anticipates a rise in interest rates through given this assumption  the company s asset liability strategy for is to achieve a positive gap position interest bearing assets subject to repricing more than interest earning liabilities subject to repricing for periods up to a year 
the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income is not expected to be significant to the company s results of operations 
effective monitoring of these interest sensitivity gaps is the priority of the company s asset liability management committee

new accounting pronouncements off balance sheet commitments the company adopted fasb interpretation fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  on january  fin requires a guarantor entity  at the inception of a guarantee covered by the measurement provisions of the interpretation  to record a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the company issues financial and performance letters of credit 
financial letters of credit require the company to make payment if the customer s financial condition deteriorates  as defined in the agreements 
performance letters of credit require the company to make payments if the customer fails to perform identified non financial contractual obligations 
the company previously did not record an initial liability when guaranteeing obligations unless it became probable that the company would have to perform under the guarantee 
fin applies prospectively to guarantees the company issues or modifies subsequent to december  the company defines the initial fair value of these letters of credit as the fee received from the customer 
the maximum potential undiscounted amount of future payments on these letters of credit as of december  is million and they expire through the amounts due under these letters of credit would be reduced by any proceeds that the company would be able to obtain in liquidating the collateral for these loans 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
acquired loans in october  the aicpa issued statement of position sop accounting for loans or certain debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop applies to a loan with the evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination acquired by completion of a transfer for which it is probable at acquisition  that the company will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable 
sop requires that the company recognize the excess of all cash flows expected at acquisition over the investor s initial investment in the loan as interest income on a level yield basis over the life of the loan as the accretable yield 
the loan s contractual required payments receivable in excess of the amount of its cash flows excepted at acquisition nonaccretable difference should not be recognized as an adjustment to yield  a loss accrual or a valuation allowance for credit risk 
sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
management is currently evaluating the provisions of sop variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest 
an entity is subject to consolidation under fin if the investors either do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  are unable to direct the entity s activities  or are not exposed to the entity s losses or entitled to its residual returns variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
management has determined that npb capital trust ii qualifies as a variable interest entity under fin npb capital trust ii issued mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to investors and loaned the proceeds to the company 
npb capital trust ii holds  as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by the company in npb capital trust ii is currently included in the company s consolidated balance sheet and statements of income 
the company has evaluated the impact of fin and concluded it should continue to consolidate npb trust ii as of december   in part due to its ability to call the preferred stock prior to the mandatory redemption date and thereby benefit from a decline in required dividend yields 
subsequent to the issuance of fin  the fasb issued a revised interpretation  fin r  the provisions of which must be applied to certain variable interest entities by march  the company plans to adopt the provisions under the revised interpretation in the first quarter of fin r will require npb to deconsolidate npb capital trust ii as of march  fin r precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the trust preferred securities when determining if the company has the right to a majority of npb capital trust ii s expected residual returns 
accordingly  the company will deconsolidate npb capital trust ii at the end of the first quarter  which will result in an increase in outstanding debt by million 
the banking regulatory agencies have not issued any guidance that would change the regulatory capital treatment for the trust preferred securities issued by npb capital trust ii based on the adoption of fin r 
however  as additional interpretations from the banking regulators related to entities such as npb capital trust ii become available  management will reevaluate its potential impact to its tier i capital calculation under such interpretations
