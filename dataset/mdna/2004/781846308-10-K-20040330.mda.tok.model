rush truck center division 
since commencing operations as a peterbilt heavy duty truck dealer over years ago  we have grown to operate rush truck centers at locations  which primarily sell peterbilt class heavy duty trucks in texas  colorado  oklahoma  california  florida  arizona  new mexico and alabama 
our rush truck centers are strategically located to take advantage of increased cross border traffic between the united states and mexico resulting from implementation of the north american free trade agreement nafta in during  our rush truck center division accounted for approximately million  or  of our total revenue 
rush equipment center division 
since commencing operations as a john deere dealer in  we had grown to operate six rush equipment centers located in texas and michigan 
as previously reported  we sold our five michigan construction equipment stores during  recording a net loss from discontinued operations of million see note of item 
our rush equipment center in houston  texas will continue to provide a full line of construction equipment for light to medium sized applications 
our primary products include the following john deere backhoe loaders  hydraulic excavators  crawler dozers and four wheel drive loaders 
during  our rush equipment center division accounted for approximately million  or  of our total revenue 
rush leasing and rental division 
we provide a broad line of product selections for lease or rent  including class  class and class peterbilt trucks  and a full array of john deere construction equipment products  including a variety of construction equipment trailers and heavy duty cranes 
our lease and rental fleets are offered primarily through our rush truck centers and the rush equipment center on a daily  monthly or long term basis 
during  our rush leasing and rental division accounted for approximately million  or  of our total revenue 
rush financial and insurance division 
we offer third party financing to assist customers in purchasing a new or used truck or piece of construction equipment 
additionally  we sell a complete line of property and casualty insurance  including collision and liability insurance on trucks  cargo insurance  and credit life insurance 
during  our rush financial and insurance division accounted for approximately million  or  of our total revenue 
we were founded and incorporated in in texas and our three senior executives jointly have years of experience in the industry 
we currently conduct business through numerous subsidiaries  all of which are wholly owned  directly or indirectly  by us 
our principal offices are located at ih south  new braunfels  texas industry overview we currently operate in the heavy duty trucks and construction equipment markets 
there has historically been a high correlation in both of these markets between new product sales and the rate of change in us industrial production and the us gross domestic product 
heavy duty truck market the company serves the entire us retail heavy duty truck market which is dependent on a number of factors relating to general economic conditions  including fuel prices  government regulation  interest rate fluctuations  economic recessions and customer business cycles 
in addition  unit sales of new trucks have historically been subject to substantial cyclical variation based on such general economic conditions 
according to data published by rl polk  an industry research and publication firm  the overall domestic heavy duty truck market decreased from approximately  new class unit sales in to approximately  new class unit sales in a compounded decrease 
during  domestic heavy duty truck sales decreased approximately from and are expected to increase to approximately  units during our primary product line is peterbilt trucks  which  according to rl polk  accounted for approximately of all new heavy duty truck registrations in historically  peterbilt s market share has been significantly higher than its national average in rush s areas of responsibility 
as a result of our aggressive sales approach  new store openings and acquisitions in new markets  our share of the heavy duty truck market increased from approximately of the overall heavy duty market share in the us to an overall heavy duty market share in the us of in typically  class trucks are assembled by the manufacturer utilizing certain components manufactured by other companies  including engines  transmissions  axles  wheels and other components 
as trucks and truck components have become increasingly complex  including the use of computerized controls and diagnostic systems  the ability to provide state of the art service for a wide variety of truck equipment has become a competitive factor in the industry 
such service requires a significant capital investment in advanced equipment  parts inventory and a high level of training of service personnel 
environmental protection agency epa and department of transportation dot regulatory guidelines for service processes  including body shop  paint work and waste disposal  require sophisticated operating and testing equipment to ensure compliance with environmental and safety standards 
additionally  we believe that the trend of leasing and renting class trucks will continue as fleets  particularly private fleets  seek to establish full service leases or rental contracts which provide for turn key service including equipment  maintenance  and potentially  fuel  fuel tax reporting and other services 
as a result  differentiation between truck dealers has become less dependent on pure price competition and is increasingly based on their ability to offer a wide variety of services to their clients 
such services include easily accessible  efficient and sophisticated truck service and replacement parts  financing for truck purchases  leasing and rental programs and the ability to accept multiple unit trade ins related to large fleet purchases 
we believe our one stop concept and the size and diversity of our dealer network gives us a competitive advantage in providing these services 
the epa mandated that heavy duty engine manufacturers meet new  stricter emissions guidelines  regarding nitrous oxides  for all engines built subsequent to october  these new guidelines increased the price of new heavy duty trucks approximately  to  per unit and possibly reduced the operating efficiency and life of heavy duty trucks 
as a result  the company experienced stronger than usual truck sales during the second half of as customers made purchases of trucks manufactured under the old emission laws 
this accelerated demand in the second half of was followed by a short term decrease in demand during the first half of subsequent to the guidelines that were effective october   the epa has placed additional guidelines  further restricting the emissions of nitrous oxides for all engines built subsequent to january  historically  the industry has experienced an accelerated demand for trucks in the months preceding the effective date of the change in epa guidelines  followed by a short term decrease in demand in the months subsequent to the change 
the company does not expect the change in emission guidelines to have an affect on its results from operations 
the company believes it is too early to determine how the change in emission guidelines will affect its results from operations subsequent to subsequent to this expected short term decline in demand  industry sales improved during the second half of the heavy duty truck industry as a whole expects to deliver approximately  new trucks in the us during  compared to approximately  new trucks in and  new trucks in the and new heavy duty truck sales totals were the lowest heavy duty truck sales totals in the last nine years 
we believe that the new heavy duty truck sales industry will begin to improve in and that we will perform at a level above our competitors 
management believes the long term growth prospects for the heavy duty truck industry remain positive 
factors  which management believes favor the continued long term growth in the heavy duty truck industry  include the following growth in demand for consumer and industrial goods  in part as a result of the internet  which has fostered a desire by consumers to receive home delivery of a wider selection of packages  competitive pressures for just in time manufacturing processes where us manufacturers are demanding faster  yet less costly  small shipment services  deregulation in the trucking industry leading to a proliferation of freight haulers  the rise of intermodal service which utilizes the inherent advantages of both highway and rail transportation to provide consumers with a consistent and low cost method to transport their goods  and the significant increase of cross border truck traffic between mexico and the united states since nafta became effective in january of construction equipment market through our rush equipment center  which is an authorized john deere dealer  we serve the houston  texas and surrounding area for retail sales of construction equipment targeted towards light and medium applications 
according to data compiled by john deere  approximately  units of construction equipment were put into use in our area of responsibility in compared to  in the construction equipment industry expects to sell approximately  to  new construction equipment units in the houston area during the company s market share in the houston area was in and in rush equipment center has the exclusive right to sell new john deere equipment and parts within its assigned area of responsibility  which means competition within its market comes primarily from dealers of competing manufacturers and rental companies 
the customer base of john deere equipment users is diverse and includes residential and commercial construction businesses  independent rental companies  utility companies  government agencies  and various petrochemical  industrial and material supply businesses 
industry statistics suggest that a majority of all construction equipment is owned by a relatively small percentage of the customer base 
accordingly  john deere and its dealer group  including the rush equipment center  are aggressively developing more sophisticated ways to serve large fleet owners 
market factors affecting the construction equipment industry include the following levels of commercial  residential  and public construction activities  state and federal highway and road construction appropriations  and the consolidation and growth of the construction equipment rental business 
business strategy operating strategy 
our strategy is to operate integrated dealer networks that primarily market peterbilt heavy duty trucks or john deere construction equipment and provide complementary products and services by emphasizing the following key elements one stop centers 
we have developed our truck and construction equipment locations as one stop centers where  at one convenient location  our customers can purchase new or used heavy duty trucks or construction equipment  finance  lease or rent trucks or construction equipment  purchase aftermarket parts and accessories and have service performed by certified technicians 
we believe that this full service strategy also helps to mitigate cyclical economic fluctuations because the parts and service sales at our rush centers generally tend to be less volatile than our new and used truck and construction equipment sales 
we intend to continue to emphasize this one stop concept 
branding program 
we employ a branding program for our facilities  designating each as a rush truck center or rush equipment center through distinctive signage and uniform marketing programs  to take advantage of our existing name recognition and to communicate the standardized high quality of our products and reliability of our services throughout our dealership networks 
our branding program extends to our services as well as our facilities 
we believe that this branding strategy will increase our market recognition and encourage our customers to utilize multiple locations throughout our dealership networks 
management by dealership units 
we measure and manage the business operations of each of our dealerships according to the specific business units operating at that location 
at each of our dealerships  we operate one or more of the following business units new sales  used sales  parts  service  body shop  leasing  rental and financial services 
we believe that this system enhances the profitability of all aspects of a dealership and increases our overall operating margins 
operating goals for each business unit at each of our locations are established annually and managers are rewarded for performance accordingly 
integratedmanagementinformation systems 
in order to efficiently operate separate business units within each dealership  we rely upon our management information systems to determine and monitor appropriate inventory levels and product mix at each rush center 
each rush center maintains a centralized real time inventory tracking system that is accessible simultaneously by all locations 
our automated reordering system assists each rush center in maintaining the proper inventory levels and permits inventory delivery to each location  or directly to customers  typically within hours from the time the order is placed 
in addition  by actively monitoring market conditions  assessing product and expansion strategies and remaining abreast of changes within the market  we are able to proactively address market by market changes by realigning and  if necessary  adding product lines and models 
growth strategy 
through the implementation of our expansion and acquisition initiatives  we have grown to operate a large  multistate  full service dealership network in the heavy duty truck markets 
we intend to continue to grow our business internally and through acquisitions by expanding the product offerings available at  and capabilities of  our existing rush truck and rush equipment center  opening new rush truck and rush equipment centers in underserved markets within geographic areas we currently serve  and acquiring and rebranding existing third party dealerships within new  strategically located geographic areas 
expansion of product offerings and capabilities 
we intend to continue to expand our product lines within our rush truck centers and rush equipment center by adding those product categories which are both complementary to our peterbilt and john deere product lines and well suited to the rush operating model 
we expanded into the construction equipment industry based on a common customer base among our heavy duty truck and construction equipment purchasers 
we have also introduced trailer repair and maintenance services and the sale of truck mounted cranes at certain rush truck centers 
other recent product line expansions include the introduction of hino and ud nissan medium duty truck franchises  as well as  two autocar heavy duty truck franchises to our network 
we believe that there are many additional similar product and service offerings that complement our primary product lines 
any product category expansion that we may pursue must satisfy our requirements that the products are of a premium brand  products provide opportunities for incremental income through related servicing  aftermarket sales or financing  and rush operating controls can be implemented to enhance the financial performance of the business 
open new rush truck and equipment centers in existing markets 
we believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of the heavy duty truck and construction equipment markets by introducing our one stop centers to underserved markets within the southern united states 
additional dealerships would enable us to enhance revenues from our existing customer base as well as increase the awareness of the rush brand name for new buyers 
we believe there would also be opportunities for cost savings by integrating the inventory management and operations of these new locations with those of our existing networks 
expand into new geographic areas 
we plan to continue to expand our rush truck center network and build a rush equipment center network by acquiring additional dealerships in geographic areas contiguous to our current operations or otherwise strategically located along major interstate highways 
thus far  we have successfully expanded our presence from our texas base into a coast to coast network of rush truck centers 
we believe the geographic diversity of our network has significantly expanded our customer base while ameliorating the effects of local economic cycles 
geographic diversification supports the sale of heavy duty trucks  construction equipment and related parts by allowing us to allocate our inventory among the geographic regions we serve based on market demand within these regions 
in identifying new areas for expansion  we analyze the target market s level of new heavy duty truck registrations and construction equipment purchases  customer buying and leasing trends and the existence of competing franchises 
we also assess the potential performance of a parts and service center to determine whether a market is suitable for a rush dealership 
after a market has been strategically reviewed  we survey the region for a well situated location 
whether we acquire existing dealerships or open new rush locations  we will introduce the rush branding program and implement our integrated management system 
geographic expansion is a primary means by which we intend to continue to grow our core business 
properties a rush truck center or rush equipment center may be comprised of one or more locations  generally in close proximity  in the same metropolitan area

additionally  each rush truck center is typically staffed by a sales manager  parts manager  service manager  sales representatives  parts employees  and other service and make ready employees 
the sales staff of each rush truck center and the rush equipment center is compensated on a salary plus commission basis  with a high percentage of compensation based on commission  while the general manager  parts manager and service manager receive a combination of salary and performance bonus  with a high percentage of compensation based on the performance bonus 
the company believes that its employees are among the highest paid in their respective industries 
general managers annually prepare detailed monthly forecasts and monthly profit and loss statements based upon historical information and projected trends 
an element of each general manager s compensation is determined by meeting or exceeding these operating plans 
during the year  general managers regularly review their facility s progress with senior management and make appropriate adjustments as needed 
most employees of the company receive annual performance evaluations 
the company has been successful in retaining its senior management  general managers and other employees 
to promote communication and efficiency in operating standards  general managers and members of senior management attend several company wide strategy sessions per year 
in addition  management personnel attend various industry sponsored leadership and management seminars and receive continuing education on peterbilt products  john deere products  marketing strategies and management information systems 
members of senior management regularly travel to each location to provide on site management and support 
each location is audited regularly for administrative record keeping  human resources and environmental compliance matters 
the company has instituted succession planning pursuant to which employees in each rush truck and equipment center are groomed as assistant managers to assume management responsibilities in existing and future dealerships 
purchasing and suppliers 
the company believes that pricing is an important element of its marketing strategy 
because of its size  the rush truck center division benefits from volume purchases at favorable prices that permit it to achieve a competitive pricing position in the industry 
the company purchases its peterbilt heavy duty truck inventory and peterbilt parts and accessories directly from paccar 
all other manufacturers parts and accessories  including those of cummins  detroit diesel  caterpillar and others  are purchased through wholesale vendors or from paccar  who buys such products in bulk for resale to the company and other peterbilt dealers 
all purchasing  volume and pricing levels and commitments are negotiated by personnel at the company s corporate headquarters 
the company has been able to negotiate favorable pricing levels and terms  which enables the company to offer competitive prices for its products 
the company purchases all of its john deere construction equipment inventory and john deere parts directly from john deere 
all other construction equipment manufacturers parts and accessories are purchased by the company through wholesale vendors 
management information systems 
each rush truck center and the rush equipment center maintains a centralized real time inventory tracking system which is accessible simultaneously by all locations and by the company s corporate office 
the company utilizes its management information systems to monitor the inventory level at each of its facilities 
from information assimilated from the company s management information systems  management has developed a model reflecting historic sales levels of different product lines 
this model enables management to identify the appropriate level and combination of inventory and forms the basis of the company s operating plan 
the company s management information systems and databases are also used to monitor market conditions and sales information and assess product and expansion strategies 
information received from state and regulatory agencies  manufacturers and industry contacts allows the company to determine market share statistics and gross volume sales numbers for its products as well as those of competitors 
this information impacts ongoing operations because management remains aware of changes within the company s market and is able to react accordingly by realigning product lines and by adding new product lines and models 
distribution and inventory management 
the company utilizes its real time inventory management tracking system to maintain a close link between each rush truck center 
this link allows for a timely and cost effective sharing of managerial and sales information as well as the prompt transfer of inventory among various locations 
the transfer of inventory reduces delays in delivery  helps maximize inventory turns and assists in controlling problems created by overstock and understock situations 
the company is linked directly to its major suppliers  including paccar  gmc  and john deere via real time communication links for purposes of ordering and inventory management 
these automated reordering and communication systems allow the company to maintain proper inventory levels and permit the company to have inventory delivered to its locations  or directly to customers  typically within hours of an order being placed

seasonality the company s heavy duty truck business is moderately seasonal 
seasonal effects on new truck sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base  including small and large fleets  governments  corporations and owner operators 
however  truck parts and service operations historically have experienced higher volumes of sales in the second and third quarters 
seasonal effects in the construction equipment business are primarily driven by the weather 
seasonal effects on construction equipment sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base that includes contractors for both residential and commercial construction  utility companies  federal  state and local government agencies  and various petrochemical  industrial and material supply type businesses that require construction equipment in their daily operations 
backlog on december   the company s backlog of truck orders was approximately million as compared to a backlog of truck orders of approximately million on december  the company includes in its backlog only confirmed orders 
it takes between days and six months for the company to receive delivery from paccar once an order is placed 
the company expects to fill at least of the current backlog of truck orders by the end of the company sells approximately of its new heavy duty trucks by customer special order  with the remainder sold out of inventory 
included in the company s backlog as of december  are orders from a number of the company s major fleet customers 
environmental standards and other governmental regulations our operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations  including laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment  which primarily relate to our service operations 
the epa mandated that heavy duty engine manufacturers meet new  stricter emissions guidelines  regarding nitrous oxides  for all engines built subsequent to october  these new guidelines increased the price of a new heavy duty truck approximately  to  per unit and possibly reduced the operating efficiency and life cycle of the truck 
as a result of this epa mandate  the company experienced stronger than expected truck sales during the second half of as customers made purchases of trucks manufactured under the old emission laws 
subsequent to the guidelines that were effective october   the epa has placed additional guidelines  further restricting the emissions of nitrous oxides for all engines built subsequent to january  historically  the industry has experienced an accelerated demand for trucks in the months preceding the effective date of the change in epa guidelines  followed by a short term decrease in demand in the month subsequent to the change 
the company does not expect the change in emission guidelines to have an affect on its results from operations 
the company believes it is too early to determine how the change in emission guidelines will affect its results from operations subsequent to product warranties both peterbilt and john deere provide the retail purchasers of their products with a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship  excluding certain specified components which are separately warranted by the suppliers of such components 
we do not undertake to provide any warranty to our customers 
we generally sell our used trucks and construction equipment as is and without manufacturer s warranty  although manufacturers sometimes will provide a limited warranty on their used products if they have been properly reconditioned prior to resale or if the manufacturer s warranty on such product is transferable and has not yet expired 
we do not undertake to provide any warranty to our used truck or construction equipment customers 
trademarks the peterbilt  john deere  volvo  gmc  hino  and ud nissan trademarks and trade names  which are used in connection with our marketing and sales efforts  are subject to a limited license by us from each of the respective manufacturers 
these names are recognized internationally and are important in the marketing of our products 
each licensor engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in its marketing areas 
we hold a registered trademark from the us patent and trademark office for the name rush 
employees at december   we employed approximately  people 
we have no contracts or collective bargaining agreements with labor unions and have never experienced work stoppages 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
termination of dealership agreements upon a change of control a substantial percentage of our revenues is derived from sales of peterbilt trucks and john deere products 
therefore  our business is highly dependent on the paccar and john deere dealership agreements  which authorize us to sell peterbilt and john deere products in our market areas 
our dealership agreements with paccar are terminable by paccar in the event the aggregate voting power of mr 
w 
marvin rush mr 
rush and his family decreases below with respect to the election of directors 
the john deere dealership agreement would similarly be terminable by john deere if the aggregate voting power of mr 
rush and his family were to decrease below 
as of december   mr 
rush and his family owned  shares of each of the company s class a common stock  
par value per share the class a common stock  and the company s class b common stock  
par value per share the class b common stock  or approximately of the outstanding voting power 
the company has no control over the transfer or disposition of the shares of the company s common stock by mr 
rush or by mr 
rush s estate 
if mr 
rush were to sell his class b common stock or bequest his class b common stock to nonfamily members or if mr 
rush s estate were required to liquidate his class b common stock to pay estate taxes or otherwise  the change of control provisions of the dealership agreements described above would be triggered and could cause the company to lose its critical right to sell peterbilt and john deere products 
any loss of rights under its dealership agreements would have a severely adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
item properties see properties section in item item legal proceedings from time to time  we are involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the ordinary course of business 
we maintain liability insurance  including product liability coverage  in amounts deemed adequate by management 
to date  aggregate costs to us for claims  including product liability actions  have not been material 
however  an uninsured or partially insured claim  or claim for which indemnification is not available  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we believe that there are no claims or litigation pending the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation  there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution occurred

the company s stock trades on nasdaq under the symbols rusha and rushb 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies  which are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by specific identification for new and used truck and construction equipment inventory and by the first in  first out method for tires  parts and accessories 
an allowance is provided when it is anticipated that cost will exceed net realizable value 
other assets other assets consist primarily of goodwill related to acquisitions and other intangible assets 
as stated in note  financial accounting standards board statement no 
sfas provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment 
sfas requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions in order to allocate goodwill to reporting units and to determine the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market condition  projected cash flows  interest rates and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires  in lieu of amortization  an annual impairment review of goodwill 
the impact of adopting sfas  effective january   resulted in the cessation of goodwill amortization  which would have approximated million of pretax amortization expense from continuing operations during and million of pretax amortization expense from continuing operations during the company did not record an impairment charge related to the goodwill for its continuing operations as a result of its december  impairment review 
the company did  however  record an impairment of goodwill related to its discontinued operations at december  see note 
furthermore  sfas exposes the company to the possibility that changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future  thus resulting in a potential increase in earnings volatility 
revenue recognition policies income on the sale of a vehicle or a piece of construction equipment a unit is recognized when the customer executes a purchase contract with us  a unit has been delivered to the customer and there are no significant uncertainties related to financing or collectibility 
lease and rental income is recognized over the period of the related lease or rental agreement 
parts and service revenue is earned at the time the company sells the parts to its customers or at the time the company completes the service work order related to service provided to the customer s unit 
payments received on prepaid maintenance plans are deferred as a component of accrued expenses and recognized as income when the maintenance is performed 
finance and insurance revenue recognition finance income related to the sale of a unit is recognized over the period of the respective finance contract  based on the effective interest rate method  if the finance contract is retained by the company 
during  and  no finance contracts were retained for any significant length of time by the company but were generally sold to certain finance companies concurrent with the sale of the related unit 
the majority of finance contracts are sold without recourse 
the company s liability related to finance contracts sold with recourse is generally limited to to of the outstanding amount of each note initiated on behalf of the finance company 
the company arranges financing for customers through various financial institutions and receives a commission from the lender equal to the difference between the interest rates charged to customers over the predetermined interest rates set by the financing institution 
the company also receives commissions from the sale of various insurance products to customers and extended service contracts 
revenue is recognized by the company upon the sale of such finance and insurance contracts to the finance and insurance companies  net of a provision for estimated repossession losses and interest charge backs 
the company is not the obligor under any of these contracts 
in the case of finance contracts  a customer may prepay  or fail to pay  thereby terminating the contract 
if the customer terminates a retail finance contract or other insurance product prior to scheduled maturity  a portion of these fees may be charged back to the company based on the relevant terms of the contracts 
such estimate of ultimate charge back exposure is based on the company s historical charge back expense arising from similar contracts  including the impact of refinance and default rates on retail finance contracts 
the actual amount of historical charge backs has not been significantly different than the company s estimates 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis includes the company s historical results of operations for  and the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  new and used truck sales parts and service construction equipment sales lease and rental finance and insurance other total revenues cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating income from continuing operations interest expense  net gain on sale of assets income before income taxes from continuing operations income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income loss fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december revenues revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in sales of new and used trucks increased million  or  from million in to million in unit sales of new class trucks decreased  from  units in to  units in the decline in new class truck sales was primarily due to the pre buy experienced during the last half of caused by emission law changes that became effective october  and the buying cycle of one of the company s major fleet customers  who made a significantly larger purchase in than in the company s average sales price per class truck increased by in compared to this increase is directly related to the increased engine costs that resulted from the new emission laws

gross profit as a percentage of sales remained relatively flat at in and in gross margins on class truck sales  exclusive of manufacturer incentives  were down from in to in the decrease is a result of the company accepting smaller margins on several first time purchases by fleet customers 
given the increasing demand for class trucks coupled with the expected increase in purchases from owner operators that historically have rendered higher gross margins than fleet sales  the company expects gross margins from class truck sales in to exceed those achieved in additionally  each year the company evaluates its reserve for new truck valuation losses

although sales of gmc  hino and ud models will grow significantly as a percentage of total medium duty sales in  the company expects the gross margin to approximate the achieved during gross margins on used truck sales decreased from in to in  primarily due to the mix of wholesale versus retail used truck sales 
the company experienced higher than normal used truck wholesale transactions related to the trade in units from first time new truck fleet customers 
the company does not expect to purchase as many used trucks from first time new truck fleet customers in  which should result in increased gross margins on used truck sales compared to additionally  each year the company evaluates its reserve for used truck valuation losses 
the company recorded a million loss provision  primarily related to trade in units from first time new truck fleet customers  to increase the company s reserve for used truck valuation losses in compared to a million loss provision recognized during gross margins from the company s parts  service and body shop operations decreased from in to in there are various reasons for this decrease  including nonproprietary parts sales becoming a larger percentage of the company s overall parts sales and competitive pricing pressures from providers of nonproprietary parts 
historically  gross margins on nonproprietary parts are approximately to lower than gross margins on proprietary parts

seasonality the company s heavy duty truck business is moderately seasonal 
seasonal effects on new truck sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base  which includes small and large fleets  governments  corporations and owner operators 
however  truck parts and service operations historically have experienced higher volumes of sales in the second and third quarters 
seasonal effects on the construction equipment business are primarily driven by the weather 
seasonal effects on construction equipment sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base that includes contractors for both residential and commercial construction  utility companies  federal  state and local government agencies  and various petrochemical  industrial and material supply type businesses that require construction equipment in their daily operations 
cyclicality the company s business  as well as the entire retail heavy duty truck industry  is dependent on a number of factors relating to general economic conditions  including fuel prices  interest rate fluctuations  economic recessions  government regulation and customer business cycles 
in addition  unit sales of new trucks have historically been subject to substantial cyclical variation based on such general economic conditions 
according to rl polk  industry wide domestic retail sales of class trucks resulted in approximately  new class truck registrations in the industry forecasts heavy duty new truck sales to increase to approximately  units during the company believes that its geographic expansion  concentration on high margin parts and service operations  and diversity of its customer base will reduce the overall impact to the company resulting from general economic conditions and cyclical trends affecting the heavy duty truck industry 
however  the company s operations will be affected by any general economic conditions or cyclical trends  either positive or negative  affecting the heavy duty truck industry 
effects of inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the last few years have not had a significant impact on revenues or profitability 
the company does not expect inflation to have any near term material effects on the sale of our products and services 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be no such effect in the future 
environmental standards and other governmental regulations our operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations  including laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment 
the environmental protection agency epa has mandated that heavy duty engine manufacturers meet new  stricter emissions guidelines  regarding nitrous oxides  for all engines built subsequent to january  historically  the industry has experienced an accelerated demand for trucks in the months preceding the effective date of the change in epa guidelines  followed by a short term decrease in demand in the months subsequent to the change 
the company does not expect the change in emission guidelines to have an affect on its results from operations 
the company believes it is too early to determine how the change in emission guidelines will affect its results from operations subsequent to termination of dealership agreements upon a change of control as described in item business and this item  a substantial percentage of our revenues is derived from sales of peterbilt trucks and john deere products 
therefore  our business is highly dependant on the paccar and john deere dealership agreements  which authorize us to sell peterbilt and john deere products in our market areas 
our dealership agreements with paccar are terminable by paccar in the event the aggregate voting power of mr 
rush and his family decreases below with respect to the election of directors 
the john deere dealership agreement would similarly be terminable by john deere if the aggregate voting power of mr 
rush and his family were to decrease below 
as of december   mr 
rush and his family owned  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock  or approximately of the company s outstanding voting power 
the company has no control over the transfer or disposition by mr 
rush or by mr 
rush s estate of his class a common stock or class b common stock 
if mr 
rush were to sell his class b common stock or bequest his class b common stock to nonfamily members or if mr 
rush s estate were required to liquidate his shares of class b common stock to pay estate taxes or otherwise  the change of control provisions of the dealership agreements described above would be triggered and could cause the company to lose its critical right to sell peterbilt and john deere products 
any loss of rights under the company s dealership agreements would have a severely adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off balance sheet arrangements as of december  contractual obligations the company has certain contractual obligations which will impact its short and long term liquidity 
at december   such obligations are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  and other relevant market rate or price risks 
the company is exposed to some market risk through interest rates  related to its floor plan borrowing arrangements  variable rate debt and discount rates related to finance sales 
floor plan borrowings are based on the prime rate of interest and are used to meet working capital needs 
as of december   the company had floor plan borrowings of approximately  assuming an increase in the prime rate of interest of basis points  interest expense could increase by approximately  the interest rate variability on all other debt would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
the company provides all customer financing opportunities to various finance providers 
the company receives all finance charges in excess of a negotiated discount rate from the finance providers within days 
the negotiated discount rate is variable  thus subject to interest rate fluctuations 
this interest rate risk is mitigated by the company s ability to pass discount rate increases to customers through higher financing rates
