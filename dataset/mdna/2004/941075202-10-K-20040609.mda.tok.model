item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trend information seasonality 
collection services we provide collection services to approximately  commercial and industrial customers and approximately  residential customers 
as of december   we had a front line collection fleet size of approximately vehicles with an average fleet age of approximately six years 
commercial and industrial collection 
we provide collection services to a variety of commercial and industrial customers in all of our geographic markets where we have collection operations 
we perform such services principally under one to three year service agreements  which typically contain provisions for automatic renewal and which prohibit the customer from terminating the agreement prior to its expiration date without incurring a penalty 
we provide roll off containers to customers for temporary services  such as for construction projects  under short term purchase orders 
we also provide stationary compactors to our customers  which allow them to compact their waste at their premises prior to its collection 
commercial and industrial collection vehicles normally require one operator 
we provide two to eight cubic yard containers to commercial customers and ten to fifty cubic yard containers to industrial customers  including our roll off accounts 
we determine the fees we charge our customers by a variety of factors  including collection frequency  level of service  route density  the type  volume and weight of the waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged by competitors for similar services 
our contracts with commercial and industrial customers typically allow us to pass on increased costs resulting from variable items such as disposal and fuel costs and surcharges 
our ability to pass on price increases is sometimes limited by the terms of our contracts 
residential collection 
we provide residential waste collection services in all of our geographic markets where we have collection operations through a variety of contractual arrangements  including contracts with municipalities  owners and operators of large residential complexes and mobile home parks  and homeowners associations 
we also provide such services through residential subscription arrangements with individual homeowners in certain markets 

table of contents our contracts with municipalities are typically for a term of up to five years and contain a formula  generally based on a predetermined published price index  for automatic adjustments to fees to cover increases in some  but not all  of our operating costs 
certain of our contracts with municipalities contain renewal provisions 
the fees we charge for residential solid waste collection services provided on a subscription basis are based primarily on route density  the frequency and level of service  the distance to the disposal or transfer facility  the cost of disposal or transfer and prices we charge in the market for similar services 
transfer station services we operate transfer stations and are constructing new transfer stations in arizona and texas 
our transfer stations receive solid waste from our own operations and from third parties  compact the waste and transfer it for disposal to our own or third party landfills 
we charge third parties fees to dispose of their waste at our transfer stations 
we typically subcontract the transportation of waste from our transfer stations to the landfill 
transfer station fees are generally based on the cost of processing  transportation and disposal 
we believe that the benefits of using our transfer stations include improved utilization of our collection infrastructure and better relationships with municipalities and private operators that deliver waste to our transfer stations  which can lead to additional growth opportunities 
we believe that transfer stations will become increasingly valuable as new landfills are opening further away from metropolitan areas and waste needs to travel further for disposal 
commercial and residential recycling services we offer collection and processing services to our municipal  commercial and industrial customers for a variety of recyclable materials  including cardboard  office paper  plastic containers  glass bottles  fiberboard  and ferrous and aluminum metals 
we operate five material recovery facilities in ontario  canada and seven in florida 
these facilities are used to sort  bale and ship recyclable materials to market 
we also deliver recyclable materials that we collect to third parties for processing and resale 
in an effort to reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations on recycled materials  where competitive pressures permit  we charge collection or processing fees for recycling volume collected from our customers 
we believe that recycling will continue to be an important component of municipal solid waste management plans due to the public s environmental awareness and regulations that mandate or encourage recycling 
landfill disposal services we charge our landfill and transfer station customers a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our transfer stations and landfills 
we generally base our landfill tipping fees on market factors and the type and weight of or volume of the waste deposited 
we generally base our transfer station tipping fees on market factors and the cost of processing the waste deposited at the transfer station  the cost of transporting the waste to a disposal facility and the cost of disposal 
we dispose of the solid waste we collect in one of four ways i at our own landfills  ii through our own transfer stations  iii at municipally owned landfills  or iv at third party landfills or transfer stations 
in markets where we do not have our own landfills  we seek to secure favorable long term disposal arrangements with municipalities or private owners of landfills or transfer stations 
in those markets  our ability to maintain competitive prices for our collection services is generally dependent upon our ability to secure favorable disposal pricing 
in some markets we may enter into put or pay disposal arrangements with third party operators of disposal facilities 
these arrangements require us to deliver a minimum tonnage of waste for disposal at a fixed disposal rate  or pay a penalty equal to the minimum tonnage multiplied by that disposal rate 
these types of arrangements allow us to fix our disposal costs  but also expose us to the risk that if our tonnage declines and we are unable to deliver the minimum tonnage  we will be required to pay the penalty 

table of contents other specialized services we offer other specialized services consisting primarily of sales and leasing of compactor equipment and portable toilet services for special events or construction sites 
local regional operating structure each of our operating regions also has a number of operating districts where the business is managed on a local basis 
from a management perspective  each district has a district manager who reports to a regional vice president responsible for each of our four operating regions 
each of these regional vice presidents reports to our president and chief operating officer 
district managers are responsible for the day to day operations of their districts  including supervising their sales force  maintaining service quality  implementing our health and safety and environmental programs and overseeing contract administration 
district managers work closely with regional vice presidents to execute business plans and identify business development opportunities 
this structure is designed to provide decision making authority to our district managers who are closest to the needs of the customers they serve in the community 
this localized approach allows us to quickly identify and address customer needs  manage local operating dynamics and take advantage of market opportunities  while also providing streamlined access to our president and chief operating officer for resource allocation and other major strategic decisions 
canada we have operations throughout ontario and in saskatchewan  alberta and british columbia 
eastern canada 
our eastern canada operations are based primarily in and around metropolitan areas of southern ontario 
we operate in districts with collection operations  eight transfer stations  five material recovery facilities and one landfill 
while our southern ontario operations other than ottawa do not have internal disposal facilities  we have disposal contracts in place for a majority of our collected volume at favorable rates 
our waste services landfill located in ottawa  canada consists of acres zoned for waste disposal and another acres of contiguous land 
the acre landfill is permitted to accept up to  metric tons per year of dry waste for disposal 
we estimate that the acre site has a remaining capacity of million cubic yards and almost six years of remaining airspace on the acre parcel  at current disposal volumes 
western canada 
our western canada operations are located in the three most western canadian provinces saskatchewan  alberta and british columbia 
our hauling companies are located in and around metropolitan areas of alberta and british columbia and our two landfills are located in proximity to the industrial waste markets that they serve 
we operate in districts with nine collection operations  two transfer stations and two landfills 
the two landfills we own and operate in western canada primarily serve industrial customers and while we do not have significant internal disposal facilities  we have disposal contracts in place for a majority of our collected volume 
our gap landfill in southern saskatchewan was acquired in january and is a fully permitted industrial waste landfill which primarily services the oilfield industry 
at the time we acquired the landfill  it had been operating for approximately two years and has an estimated remaining operating life of years 
our paintearth landfill  located in coronation  alberta is permitted to accept non hazardous solid waste  construction and demolition waste and certain special wastes and includes a composting facility  a bio remediation facility and a material recycling facility 
the landfill consists of approximately acres zoned for waste disposal and another approximately acres of contiguous land that is suitable for future expansion 
we estimate that the acre site has a total remaining capacity of million cubic yards and years of remaining airspace in the current acre parcel 

table of contents united states in  we initiated a disposal based growth strategy to enter the us solid waste market 
to date  we have made strategic acquisitions of permitted or to be permitted landfill sites and collection operations in northern and central florida  phoenix  arizona and houston  texas 
florida region 
we expect that upon the completion of our acquisition of allied s northern and central florida operations and our pending acquisition of florida recycling  our florida region will be organized into three districts with collection operations  seven transfer stations  five material recovery facilities and three landfills 
the north florida district  centered around the jacksonville metropolitan area  will be comprised of two collection operations  two material recovery facilities and two landfills 
the gulf district  concentrated in the tampa st 
petersburg market area  will have six collection operations  two transfer stations and three material recovery facilities 
the central florida district  focused on the orlando metropolitan area  will have five collection operations  two transfer stations  two material recovery facilities and our jed landfill 
our jed landfill is located in osceola county  florida approximately miles south of metropolitan orlando and commenced operations in january this municipal solid waste landfill has current permitted airspace of million cubic yards 
the site has no daily or annual volume limits  and it is currently permitted to accept waste from osceola county and six surrounding counties which include the orlando metropolitan area 
southwest region 
our southwest region includes our operations in arizona and texas and includes new landfill sites outside phoenix and houston and collection operations recently acquired in the phoenix metropolitan area 
our arizona operations are focused in the phoenix metropolitan area 
the cactus waste landfill is located between phoenix and tucson  arizona  and was acquired in september this municipal solid waste landfill is expected to have an initial capacity of approximately million cubic yards 
construction of the site is expected to begin in april the site has no daily or annual volume limits and is expected to begin accepting solid waste in the second half of we have also obtained the required permits and zoning to operate and are currently constructing a transfer station in mesa  arizona 
we expect the transfer station to commence operations in the second half of since july  we have acquired seven collection companies that will be consolidated into a single collection operation in the phoenix market 
we believe these collection businesses will deliver significant volumes of municipal solid waste to the cactus waste landfill when it begins to accept delivery of waste  which we expect to occur in the second half of our long point landfill is located approximately miles southwest of metropolitan houston  texas  in fort bend county and was acquired in february this municipal solid waste landfill has a total area of approximately  acres with initial permitted capacity of million cubic yards 
construction of the site is expected to begin in april the site has no daily or annual volume limits and is expected to begin accepting solid waste in the second half of in addition to the landfill facility  we acquired a leasehold interest of a site in houston that is fully permitted for the construction and operation of a solid waste transfer station 
the transfer station is expected to commence operations in the fourth quarter of segment reporting prior to fiscal  we operated in two reporting segments  the united states and canada 
as a result of the sale of our us business during  we operated exclusively in canada during we re entered the united states in may with the acquisition of the jed landfill in osceola county  florida 
we do not have significant in volume or dollars inter segment operation related transactions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included as item 
table of contents sales and marketing we market our services on a decentralized basis principally through our district managers and direct sales representatives 
our sales representatives visit customers on a regular basis and call upon potential new customers within a specified territory or service area 
these sales representatives receive a portion of their compensation based on meeting certain incentive targets 
in addition to our sales efforts directed at commercial and industrial customers  we have municipal marketing representatives in our markets in canada and florida who are responsible for interfacing with each municipality or community to which we provide residential service to ensure customer satisfaction 
our municipal representatives organize and handle bids for renewal and new municipal contracts in their service areas 
we have a diverse customer base  with no single contract or customer representing more than of consolidated revenue for the year ended december  competition the solid waste services industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with large  national solid waste services companies  as well as smaller regional solid waste services companies of varying sizes and resources 
some of our competitors are better capitalized  have greater name recognition and greater financial  operational and marketing resources than we have  and may be able to provide services at a lower cost 
we also compete with operators of alternative disposal facilities  and with municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations 
public sector operators may have financial advantages over us because of their access to user fees and similar charges as well as to tax revenue 
the canadian solid waste industry currently includes one large national waste company waste management  inc  operating through its canadian subsidiary  canadian waste 
the us solid waste industry currently includes three large national waste companies waste management  inc  allied waste industries  inc and republic services  inc 
there are also several other large public solid waste services companies  including waste connections  inc  casella waste systems  inc  and waste industries  inc 
we compete for collection  transfer and disposal volume based primarily on the price and quality of services 
from time to time  competitors may reduce the prices of their services in an effort to expand their market share or service areas or to win competitively bid municipal contracts 
these practices may cause us to reduce the prices of our services or  if we elect not to do so  to lose business 
competition exists not only for collection  transfer and disposal volume  but also for acquisition candidates 
we generally compete for acquisition candidates with publicly owned regional and large national solid waste services companies 
governmental regulation we are subject to significant federal  provincial  state and local environmental and land use laws and regulations in canada and the united states 
the enforcement of both canadian and us environmental laws has become increasingly stringent 
we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all material applicable environmental laws  permits  orders and regulations  and therefore we do not currently anticipate any significant environmental costs necessary to bring our existing operations into compliance 
we anticipate that regulation  legislation and regulatory enforcement actions related to the solid waste services industry will continue to increase 
to transport and manage solid waste  we must possess and comply with one or more permits from federal  provincial  state or local agencies and government offices 
these permits must be periodically renewed and may be modified or revoked by the issuing agency 
the principal statutes and regulations that affect our operations are described below 

table of contents canadian regulation our canadian operations are subject to environmental statutes and regulations at each of the federal  provincial and local levels 
these laws impose restrictions designed to control air  soil and water pollution and regulate health and safety  zoning and land use and the handling of hazardous and non hazardous wastes  and often empower government officials to issue administrative orders  including orders to cease carrying out a specific activity 
this regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks 
the contravention of these laws may result in substantial fines that could equal or exceed the amount of monetary benefit acquired as a result of the commission of the offense and which could materially affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our canadian operations are subject to federal and provincial legislation regulating the operation of our fleet of vehicles  as well as to provincial occupational health and safety and workers compensation statutes which establish employer responsibilities for worker health and safety 
the provisions of these statutes impose compliance burdens and costs and may result in significant penalties for failure to comply 
the canadian environmental protection act  and the regulations passed under the act regulate  among other things  the import and export of waste into and out of canada 
the transportation of dangerous goods act regulates the transport of wastes across provincial and federal borders 
ontario ontario s environmental protection act and the regulations passed under the act regulate general waste management and new or expanding landfill sites  prescribe the principal standards for the location  maintenance and operation of waste management systems  transfer and disposal sites  require the monitoring and reporting of airborne contamination and create offenses for spills  unlawful contaminant discharges or failure to comply with environmental permits or approvals 
the operation of a waste management system or a waste transfer or disposal site in ontario requires a certificate of approval or a provisional certificate of approval issued by the ministry of the environment under part v of the ontario environmental protection act 
we have applied for and obtained certificates of approval for the operation of all of our existing waste management systems and waste transfer and disposal sites in ontario 
the waste diversion act created the waste diversion organization  which has a mandate to develop  implement and operate waste diversion programs  designed to increase the diversion of waste from disposal 
programs developed in included recycling municipal blue box  waste oil and used tires  with programs for organics  electronics and household special wastes ie paints and solvents to follow in later years 
the ontario water resources act prohibits unlawful discharges into water and regulates wastewater systems in ontario  including leachate collection  treatment and discharges at landfills 
in  amendments were passed to the municipal act that allow  in certain prescribed circumstances  the formation of municipal businesses to compete directly in a public competitive bidding process with the private sector waste services industry for the collection  transfer  storage  disposal or recycling of residential waste 
saskatchewan the environment management and protection act of and the regulations passed under the act govern waste management activities carried on in saskatchewan  including the permitting and operation of our gap disposal landfill 
alberta the environmental protection and enhancement act comprehensively regulates the management and control of waste  including hazardous waste  and creates offenses for spills and other matters of non 
table of contents compliance 
the waste control regulation deals in detail with the identification of wastes and requirements for the handling  storage and disposal of waste 
the waste control legislation is currently under review 
waste management facilities currently permitted under the alberta public health act  including our landfill in coronation  alberta  must be permitted by alberta environment no later than and the permit must be renewed every years thereafter 
renewal of the coronation  alberta landfill site permit may result in the imposition of additional permit conditions that may increase the cell development and operating cost above current levels  or may limit the type  quantity or quality of waste that may be accepted 
new landfill design standards are being developed by alberta environment that may require us to construct or operate future landfill cells and infrastructure to a higher and potentially more costly standard than currently permitted 
british columbia the environmental management act creates offenses related to spills  unlawful discharges and failure to comply 
a new environmental management act and the waste management act are expected to be proclaimed in effect in the first half of among many changes  under the new act  a risk based approach will be applied to the permitting process for all businesses and activities and regulations will be developed to increase the use of administrative penalties as a compliance enforcement tool 
various other provincial statutes  such as the transportation of dangerous goods act deal generally with environmental matters and could also impact our operations in british columbia 
municipal regulation many municipal governments have passed local by laws  including zoning and health measures by laws that limit our activities to prescribed sites or activities  control the delivery of solid wastes to prescribed sites  restrict or ban the movement of solid waste into a municipality and regulate discharges into municipal sewers from our solid waste facilities 
there has been an increasing trend to mandate and encourage waste reduction and separation at source and waste recycling  and to prohibit or restrict the disposal of certain solid waste  such as yard waste  leaves and tires  in landfills 
such restrictions could affect the ability of our transfer stations and landfills to operate at full capacity 
united states regulation the principal laws and regulations that affect our us operations including those that were sold in and which could continue to result in liability to us  as well as waste that we export from our canadian operations to landfills located in the united states are described below 
the resource conservation and recovery act of the resource conservation and recovery act of  or rcra  regulates the generation  treatment  storage  handling  transportation and disposal of solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste 
rcra divides solid waste into two groups  hazardous and non hazardous 
wastes classified as hazardous under rcra are subject to much stricter regulation than wastes classified as non hazardous 
the subtitle d regulations  which govern solid waste landfills  include location restrictions  facility design standards  operating criteria  closure and post closure requirements  financial assurance requirements  groundwater monitoring requirements  methane gas emission control requirements  groundwater remediation standards and corrective action requirements 
the subtitle d regulations also require new landfill sites to meet more stringent liner design criteria to keep leachate out of groundwater 
each state is required to revise its landfill regulations to meet these requirements or these requirements will be automatically imposed by the environmental protection agency  or epa  on landfill owners and operators in that state 
each state is also required to adopt and implement a permit program or other appropriate system to ensure that landfills in each state comply with the subtitle d regulations 
various states in 
table of contents which we currently operate or in which we may operate in the future have adopted regulations or programs as stringent as  or more stringent than  the subtitle d regulations 
the federal water pollution control act of the federal water pollution control act of  or clean water act  regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources into waters of the united states 
if run off from transfer stations or run off or collected leachate from landfills that we operate or own were discharged into streams  rivers or other surface waters  the clean water act requires us to obtain a discharge permit  conduct sampling and monitoring and  under certain circumstances  reduce the quantity of pollutants in the discharge 
also  virtually all landfills are required to comply with the epa s storm water regulations issued in november  which are designed to prevent contaminated landfill storm water run off from flowing into surface waters 
various states have adopted regulations that are more stringent than the federal requirements 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  or cercla  established a regulatory and remedial program intended to provide for the investigation and cleanup of facilities where or from which a release of any hazardous substance into the environment has occurred or is threatened 
cercla imposes strict joint and several liability for cleanup of facilities on current owners and operators of the site  former owners and operators of the site at the time of the disposal of the hazardous substances  any person who arranges for the transportation  disposal or treatment of the hazardous substances  and the transporters who select the disposal and treatment facilities 
cercla also imposes liability for the cost of evaluation and remediation of any damage to natural resources 
the costs of a cercla investigation and cleanup can be very substantial 
liability under cercla may be based on the existence of small amounts of the more than hazardous substances listed by the epa  many of which can be found in household waste 
if we were found to be a responsible party for a cercla cleanup  the enforcing agency could hold us  or any other generator  transporter or the owner or operator of the contaminated facility  responsible for all investigative and remedial costs  even if others were also liable 
cercla gives a responsible party the right to bring a contribution action against other responsible parties for their allocable shares of investigative and remedial costs 
our ability to obtain reimbursement from others for their allocable shares of these costs would be limited by our ability to find other responsible parties and prove the extent of their responsibility and by the financial resources of these other parties 
the clean air act of the clean air act of  or clean air act  regulates emissions of air pollutants 
the epa has developed standards that apply to certain landfills depending on the date of the landfill construction  the location of the landfill  the materials disposed at the landfill and the volume of the landfill emissions 
the epa has also issued standards regulating the disposal of asbestos containing materials under the clean air act 
air permits to construct may be required for gas collection and flaring systems  and operating permits may be required  depending on the estimated volume of emissions 
all of the federal statutes described above contain provisions authorizing  under certain circumstances  the institution of lawsuits by private citizens to enforce the provisions of the statutes 
in addition to a penalty award to the us government  some of those statutes authorize an award of attorneys fees to parties successfully advancing such an action 
the occupational safety and health act of the occupational safety and health act of is administered by the occupational safety and health administration  or osha  and in many states by state agencies whose programs have been approved by osha 
the osha act establishes employer responsibilities for worker health and safety  including the obligation to maintain a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious 
table of contents injury  to comply with adopted worker protection standards  to maintain certain records  to provide workers with required disclosures and to implement certain health and safety training programs 
various osha standards may apply to our operations  including standards concerning notices of hazards  the handling of asbestos and asbestos containing materials and worker training and emergency response programs 
flow control interstate waste restrictions certain permits and approvals  as well as certain state and local regulations  may limit a landfill in accepting waste that originates from specified geographic areas  restrict the importation of out of state waste or otherwise discriminate against out of state waste 
these restrictions  generally known as flow control restrictions  are controversial  and some courts have held that some flow control schemes violate constitutional limits on state or local regulation of interstate commerce 
from time to time  federal legislation is proposed that would allow some local flow control restrictions 
although no such federal legislation has been enacted to date  if this federal legislation should be enacted in the future  states could act to limit or prohibit the importation of out of state waste or direct that waste be handled at specified facilities 
these state actions could adversely affect landfill owners and could also result in higher disposal costs for collection operations 
even in the absence of federal legislation  certain state and local jurisdictions may seek to enforce flow control restrictions through local legislation or contract 
these restrictions could result in the volume of waste going to landfills being reduced in certain areas  which could affect the landfill owner s ability to operate the landfills at full capacity or reduce the prices that it can charge for landfill disposal services 
any such restrictions may also result in higher disposal costs for collection operations 
state and local regulation each state has laws and regulations governing the generation  storage  treatment  handling  transportation and disposal of solid waste  occupational safety and health  water and air pollution and  in most cases  the siting  design  operation  maintenance  closure and post closure maintenance of landfills and transfer stations 
in addition  many states have adopted statutes comparable to  and in some cases more stringent than  cercla 
these statutes impose requirements for investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites and liability for costs and damages associated with these sites  and some provide for the imposition of liens on property owned by responsible parties 
furthermore  many municipalities also have ordinances  local laws and regulations that affect the operations of solid waste services companies 
these include zoning and health measures that limit solid waste management activities to specified sites or activities  flow control provisions that direct the delivery of solid wastes to specific facilities  laws that grant the right to establish franchises for collection services and then put these franchises out for bid  and bans or other restrictions on the movement of solid wastes into a municipality 
permits or other land use approvals with respect to a landfill  as well as state or local laws and regulations  may specify the quantity of waste that may be accepted at the landfill during a given time period  or specify the types of waste that may be accepted at the landfill 
once an operating permit for a landfill is obtained  it must generally be renewed periodically 
there has been an increasing trend at the state and local level in the united states to mandate and encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling  and to prohibit or restrict the disposal of certain types of solid wastes  such as yard wastes  leaves and tires  in landfills 
the enactment of regulations reducing the volume and types of wastes available for transport to and disposal in landfills could affect the ability of transfer station and landfill owners to operate their sites at full capacity 
some state and local authorities enforce certain federal laws in addition to state and local laws and regulations 
for example  in some states  rcra  the occupational safety and health act  parts of the clean air act and parts of the clean water act are enforced by local or state authorities instead of by the epa  and in some states those laws are enforced jointly by state or local and federal authorities 

table of contents public utility regulation the rates that landfill operators may charge are also regulated in many states by public authorities 
the adoption of rate regulation or the reduction of current rates in states in which solid waste management companies operate could have an adverse effect on their business  financial condition and results of operations 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  full time employees  including approximately persons categorized as professionals or managers  approximately  employees involved in collection  transfer  disposal and recycling operations  and approximately sales  clerical  data processing or other administrative employees 
approximately of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  four of which expire in we are not aware of any current organized efforts among our employees and believe that relations with our employees are good 
risk factors our acquisition strategy may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and integrate acquired assets or businesses and this subjects us to risks that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations part of our strategy to expand our business and increase our revenue and profitability is to pursue the acquisition of disposal based and collection assets and businesses 
we have identified a number of acquisition candidates  both in the united states and canada  that we believe are suitable 
however  we may not be able to acquire these candidates at prices or on terms and conditions that are favorable to us 
our ability to execute our acquisition strategy also depends upon other factors  including the successful integration of acquired businesses and our ability to effectively compete in the new markets we enter 
if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or successfully complete and integrate the acquisitions  we may not realize the expected benefits from our acquisition growth strategy  including any expected benefits from the proposed vertical integration of acquired operations and disposal facilities 
our acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation and integration of the operations  technologies and personnel of the acquired company  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  potential loss of employees  diversion of resources and of our management s attention away from other business concerns  the need to obtain third party consents and regulatory approval  expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger combined company  and competition for acquisition candidates from other and better capitalized companies  which may increase the cost of acquisitions 
if we encounter any of these difficulties in completing these acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses  this could adversely affect our results of operations 
many of these risks are particularly acute in the fiscal quarters immediately following the completion of an acquisition because that is when the operations of an acquired business are integrated into our operations 
once integrated  acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenue  profitability or productivity comparable with those that our existing 
table of contents operations achieve or may otherwise not perform as we expected 
we could  as a result  decide to change our strategy for that market and sell the operations we have acquired at a loss or recognize an impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets 
our completed and pending acquisitions of the allied assets and the pending acquisition of florida recycling make evaluating our operating results difficult given the significance of these acquisitions to our previous operations and our historical results may not give you an accurate indication of how we will perform in the future our completed and pending acquisitions of the assets of allied s northern and central florida operations and our pending acquisition of all of the shares of florida recycling  inc or florida recycling may make it more difficult for us to evaluate and predict our future operating performance 
our historical results of operations do not give effect to the completed and pending acquisitions of the allied assets and the pending acquisition of the shares of florida recycling 
accordingly  the historical financial information in this annual report does not necessarily reflect what our financial position  operating results and cash flows will be in the future as a result of these acquisitions 
we may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the anticipated benefits of these completed and pending acquisitions and may not be able to maintain or achieve profitability of any of the acquired businesses or overall 
consequently  our historical results of operations may not give you an accurate indication of how we  together with the assets from allied and florida recycling  will perform in the future 
our recent agreement to acquire florida recycling is subject to financing conditions and other customary closing conditions which  if they are not met as a result of our default  will result in us forfeiting the deposit paid under that agreement and not completing the florida recycling acquisition we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of florida recycling for a purchase price of million in cash  subject to certain changes in working capital  and the issuance of  common shares 
the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions  including financing conditions 
as part of this transaction  we have advanced deposits of million in cash and  in common shares 
if the closing is not completed on or before may  we are required to make an additional advance of million and the sellers may terminate the agreement  at which point we would forfeit all cash and common share advances 
the amount required to finance the payment of the cash component of the purchase price for the florida recycling acquisition is approximately million 
we currently intend to raise the necessary funds for this payment through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities 
if we are not able to obtain financing for the florida recycling acquisition on terms acceptable to us  or if any of the other closing conditions are not met for the acquisition as a result of our default  then we would forfeit the deposit we paid under the acquisition agreement 
we may be unable to attract sufficient capital to fund our acquisition strategy  which will limit our future growth we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of seller financing  cash from operations  borrowings under our financing facilities or issuing additional equity or debt securities 
seller financing depends upon the sellers willingness to accept our shares as part of the consideration for an acquisition and our willingness to issue our common shares  which will be impacted by the market value of our common shares 
if seller financing is not available  we will have to use cash from operations  borrowings under our financing facilities or issue additional equity or debt securities 
the use of cash from operations to finance acquisitions may reduce the funds we have available for other corporate purposes 
additional borrowings from our lenders will increase interest expenses and may require us to commit to additional covenants  which further limit our financial and operational flexibility 
this could restrict our ability to obtain additional debt on favorable terms  or at all  which would limit our ability to finance our 
table of contents acquisitions 
accordingly  we may not be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all 
our business is capital intensive and may consume cash in excess of cash flow from our operations and borrowings our ability to remain competitive  sustain our growth and maintain our operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and our access to capital 
we intend to fund our cash needs through our operating cash flow  borrowings and equity issuances 
we may require additional equity or debt financing to fund our growth and debt repayment obligations 
during  we had capital expenditures of million 
separately  we have provided for our liabilities related to our closure and post closure obligations 
as we undertake acquisitions  expand our operations  and deplete our landfills  our cash expenditures will increase 
as a result  working capital levels may decrease and require financing 
in addition  if we must close a landfill sooner than we currently anticipate  or if we reduce our estimate of a landfill s remaining available air space  we may be required to incur such cash expenditures earlier than originally anticipated 
expenditures for closure and post closure obligations may increase as a result of any federal  state or local government regulatory action taken to accelerate such expenditures 
these factors could substantially increase our cash expenditures and therefore impair our ability to invest in our existing or new facilities 
we will need to refinance our existing credit facilities and may need to refinance other debt to pay the principal amounts due at maturity 
in addition  we may need additional capital to fund future acquisitions and the integration of the businesses that we acquire 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow  we may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to pay our debt obligations and capital expenditures or we may not be able to refinance on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we may face significant exposure to unknown liabilities in connection with our acquisitions while we have in place a due diligence process to review the businesses we acquire  we may not identify or we may underestimate our exposure for certain liabilities of the businesses we acquire 
as a result  we may become responsible for liabilities of the businesses we acquire  including liabilities for environmental claims that were not discovered or fully quantified prior to completing the acquisition and for which we are unable to recover from the seller 
although we seek to minimize the impact of potential undiscovered liabilities by structuring acquisitions to minimize liabilities and obtaining indemnities and warranties from the selling party  these methods may not fully protect us from the impact of all undiscovered liabilities 
for example  indemnities or warranties are often limited in scope  amount or duration  and may not fully cover the liabilities for which they were intended 
in addition  even if these undiscovered liabilities are covered by indemnities or warranties  the selling parties may become insolvent and may be unable to satisfy any claims we may have against them 
we may incur significant expenses in pursuing acquisitions or developing and expanding disposal sites  and costs that are expensed for failed undertakings of this nature could reduce our results of operations we may incur significant expenses in pursuing an acquisition or developing and expanding disposal sites 
these include professional and consulting fees paid to complete our due diligence review of our acquisition targets 
we capitalize certain of these expenses  as well as the costs of disposal site development and expansions 
if an acquisition is no longer considered probable  or if a disposal site development or expansion is not completed or is determined to be impaired  we would charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures incurred in connection with that acquisition or disposal site or expansion 
in future periods  we may be required to incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or due to other events that cause impairments 
depending upon the magnitude of the charges  this could materially reduce our operating results and may negatively impact our covenants to our lenders and to the preferred stockholders of waste services  which could adversely affect our liquidity 

table of contents our indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions and competitive pressures  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  require us to dedicate or reserve a large portion of cash flow from operations to service debt  and limit our ability to take actions that would increase our revenue and execute our growth strategy we have indebtedness under our million existing credit facilities  other subordinated promissory notes  capital lease obligations  and cumulative mandatory redeemable preferred stock issued by our us subsidiary  waste services  inc or waste services  to a third party 
our existing credit facilities are comprised of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility maturing on december  the existing credit facilities are collateralized by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our current and future acquired assets and that of our subsidiaries 
the amount of indebtedness owed under our existing credit facilities may have adverse consequences for us  including making us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions and competitive pressures  limiting our ability to borrow additional funds  requiring us to dedicate or reserve a large portion of cash flow from operations to service debt  limiting our ability to plan for or react to changes in our business and industry and placing us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt in relation to cash flow 
we expect to refinance our existing credit facilities with other sources of financing  which may include  but not be limited to new senior credit facilities  a subordinated note offering and other debt or equity offerings 
if we are unable to access capital or private equity markets in the next twelve months  we would be required to extend the existing credit facilities at an increased interest rate 
the existing credit facilities bear interest at per annum and have an initial term of days with an extension option 
if the option is exercised  the term of the existing credit facilities would extend to july at a rate of per annum 
the increased interest expense would have an adverse effect on our profitability

in addition to our indebtedness under the existing credit facilities  in may  waste services issued  shares of its preferred stock to kelso investment associates vi  lp and kep vi  llc collectively  kelso 
the preferred stock of waste services entitles the holders to a liquidation preference of  per share and a cumulative cash dividend of per annum compounding and accruing quarterly in arrears 
the preferred stock  including all accrued and unpaid dividends  must be redeemed in full by no later than may  we have the option to redeem all or any part of the preferred stock prior to that date  subject to the payment of certain premiums if we elect to redeem the preferred stock prior to may  if we do not exercise our option to redeem all of the preferred stock by may   kelso may require waste services to initiate a sale of waste services or its assets on terms acceptable to its board of directors consistent with the exercise by the board members of their fiduciary obligations 
if kelso exercises this right  we may lose control of waste services or be forced to sell it at a lower price than we might otherwise expect to receive 
certain actions of waste services and its affiliates require the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the preferred stock 
all of these covenants and restrictions could limit the manner in which we conduct our operations and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital 
any failure by us to comply with these covenants and restrictions will  unless waived by kelso  result in an immediate obligation to redeem all of the then outstanding preferred stock 
if such events occurred  we would be required to refinance waste services or obtain capital from other sources  including sales of additional debt or equity or the sale of assets  in order to meet our redemption obligations 
we may not be successful in obtaining alternative sources of funding to repay this obligation should events of default occur 
we expect to incur substantial costs and expenses related to our migration transaction and may also incur substantial penalties if we do not complete this transaction by june  such as a higher dividend rate that accrues on the preferred stock of our us subsidiary waste services we intend to complete a reorganization by way of a plan of arrangement under the business corporations act ontario  which we refer to as our migration transaction 
by the terms of the plan of 
table of contents arrangement  waste services  which is currently our us subsidiary  will become the parent company of our corporate group 
in order to complete the migration transaction  we must seek and obtain the approval of the superior court of justice ontario as well as the approval of a special majority of our shareholders 
by the terms of the business corporations act ontario  shareholders may have a right to dissent from approving the migration transaction 
if shareholders are granted a right to dissent  shareholders who properly dissent in accordance with the business corporations act ontario are entitled to be paid the fair value of their common shares  determined as of the close of business on the date before the resolution approving the migration transaction was adopted 
we must also seek and obtain certain regulatory approvals in both the united states and canada 
in completing the migration transaction  we expect to incur substantial legal and accounting costs 
these costs must be expensed as they are incurred and will have a negative effect on our profitability until the completion of the migration transaction 
the migration transaction may also divert management s attention away from its day to day responsibilities 
by the terms of our agreements with kelso  relating to the shares of preferred stock of waste services  if we do not complete the migration transaction by june   the dividend payable on the preferred stock of waste services issued to kelso will increase by per annum  from  for every month that the migration transaction is delayed  up to a maximum increase of an additional per annum 
we may also be required to issue to kelso an additional  warrants per month for each month that the migration transaction is delayed after june   up to an additional  warrants to purchase common stock of waste services  at an exercise price of per share 
the increase in the dividend payable on the waste services preferred stock issued to kelso would increase the amount to be paid to kelso on the redemption of the preferred stock and would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition by increasing our liabilities 
if the migration transaction is not completed at all  kelso may also require us to exchange the existing  warrants to purchase common stock of waste services  and any of the additional warrants for common stock of waste services issued as a result of us completing the migration transaction after june   for warrants to purchase our common shares 
the issuance of additional common shares upon the exercise of the warrants would result in a substantial dilution of the existing shareholders holdings 
to the extent our reserves or accruals are inadequate to cover landfill closing and post closing care costs  these obligations could reduce our cash flow and profitability we have significant financial obligations to pay closure and post closure care costs for the landfills we currently own and will likely have similar obligations with respect to any landfills that we acquire in the future 
we rely on internally performed studies in estimating our obligations for future closure and post closure care costs 
these studies could be inaccurate and this could result in the costs incurred by us for closure and post closure care being higher than those estimated 
actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have used in estimating these closure and post closure care costs  for example  because of the impact of general economic conditions on the availability of the required materials and labor 
technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions or legislative or regulatory changes resulting in higher costs than currently estimated 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements  including changes in capping  closure or post closure care  activities  types or quantities of materials used  or the term of post closure care  could result in higher costs than those estimated by us 
the actual rate at which disposal capacity is utilized could differ from the projected timing resulting in the landfill reaching capacity earlier or later than projected and us thereby incurring closure and post closure care costs earlier or later than projected 
to the extent our reserves or accruals are inadequate to cover the actual costs of these obligations  we would have reduced cash flow and profitability 

table of contents we may be unable to obtain or maintain the environmental permits and approvals we need to operate our business  which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow we are subject to significant environmental and land use laws and regulations 
to own and operate solid waste facilities  including landfills and transfer stations  we must obtain and maintain licenses or permits  as well as zoning  environmental and other land use approvals 
it has become increasingly difficult  costly and time consuming to obtain required permits and approvals to build  operate and expand solid waste management facilities 
the process often takes several years  requires numerous hearings and compliance with zoning  environmental and other requirements and is resisted by citizen  public interest and other groups 
the cost of obtaining permits could be prohibitive 
we may not be able to obtain and maintain the permits and approvals needed to own  operate or expand our solid waste facilities 
moreover  the enactment of additional laws and regulations or the more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations could increase the costs associated with our operations 
any of these occurrences could reduce our expected earnings and cash flow 
in some markets in which we operate  permitting requirements may be prohibitive and may differ between those required of us and those required of our competitors 
our inability to obtain and maintain permits for solid waste facilities may adversely affect our ability to service our customers and compete in these markets  thereby resulting in reduced operating revenue 
in addition  stringent controls on the design  operation  closure and post closure care of solid waste facilities could require us to undertake investigative or remedial activities  curtail operations  close a facility temporarily or permanently  or modify  supplement or replace equipment or facilities at substantial costs resulting in reduced profitability and cash flow 
any exposure to environmental liabilities  to the extent not adequately covered by insurance  could result in significant expenses  which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes  including debt service and reduction and acquisitions we could be held liable for environmental damage at solid waste facilities that we own or operate  including damage to neighboring landowners and residents for contamination of the air  soil  groundwater  surface water and drinking water 
our liability could extend to damage resulting from pre existing conditions and off site contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances that we or our predecessors arranged to transport  treat or dispose of at other locations 
we are also exposed to liability risks from businesses that we acquire because these businesses may have liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover  including noncompliance with environmental laws 
our insurance program may not cover all liabilities associated with environmental cleanup or remediation or compensatory damages  punitive damages  fines  or penalties imposed on us as a result of environmental damage caused by our operations or those of any predecessor 
the incurring of liabilities for environmental damages that are not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our liquidity and could result in significant expenses  which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes  including debt service and reduction and acquisitions 
we face competition from large and small solid waste services companies and may be unable to successfully compete with other solid waste companies reducing our operating margins the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and require substantial labor and capital resources 
we compete with large  national solid waste services companies as well as smaller regional solid waste services companies 
some of our competitors are better capitalized  have greater name recognition and greater financial  operational and marketing resources than us  and may be able to provide services at a lower cost 
we also compete with operators of alternative disposal facilities and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations 
public sector operators may have financial advantages over us because of their access to user fees and similar charges as well as to tax revenue 
responding to this competition may result in reduced operating margins 
further  competitive pressures may make our 
table of contents internal growth strategy of improving service and increasing sales penetration difficult or impossible to execute 
the termination or non renewal of existing customer contracts  or the failure to obtain new customer contracts  could result in declining revenue we derive a portion of our revenue from municipal contracts that require competitive bidding by potential service providers 
although we intend to continue to bid on municipal contracts and to rebid existing municipal contracts  such contracts may not be maintained or won in the future 
in the past year  we have found that some municipalities in canada  for example  have imposed more restrictive bonding requirements as a qualification to bid for some residential waste collection contracts 
we may be unable to meet such bonding requirements at a reasonable cost to us or at all 
these requirements may limit our ability to bid for some municipal contracts and may favor some of our competitors 
if we are unable to compete successfully for municipal contracts because of bonding requirements  we may lose important sources of revenue 
we also derive a portion of our revenue from non municipal contracts  which generally have a term of one to three years 
some of these contracts permit our customers to terminate them before the end of the contractual term 
any failure by us to replace revenue from contracts lost through competitive bidding  termination or non renewal within a reasonable time period could result in a decrease in our operating revenue and our earnings 
we depend on third parties for disposal of solid waste and if we cannot maintain disposal arrangements with them we could incur significant costs that would result in reduced operating margins and revenue we currently deliver a substantial portion of the solid waste we collect to municipally owned disposal facilities and to privately owned or operated disposal facilities 
if municipalities increase their disposal rates or if we cannot obtain and maintain disposal arrangements with private owners or operators  we could incur significant additional costs and  if we are not able to pass these cost increases on to our customers because of competitive pressures  this could result in reduced operating margins and revenue 
labor unions may attempt to organize our non unionized employees  which may result in increased operating expenses some of our employees have chosen to be represented by unions  and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with them 
labor unions may make attempts to organize our non unionized employees 
the negotiation of any collective bargaining agreement could divert management s attention away from other business matters 
if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements  we may have to wait through cooling off periods  which are often followed by union initiated work stoppages  including strikes 
unfavorable collective bargaining agreements  work stoppages or other labor disputes may result in increased operating expenses 
our operating margins and profitability may be negatively impacted by increased fuel and energy costs although fuel and energy costs account for a relatively small portion of our total operating costs  sustained increases in such costs  which we are unable to pass on to our customers because of competitive pressures  could lower our operating margins and negatively impact our profitability 
the industry in which we operate is seasonal and decreases in revenue during winter months may have an adverse effect on our results of operations  particularly for our canadian operations our operating revenue tends to be somewhat lower in the fall and winter months for our canadian operations  reflecting the lower volume of solid waste generated during those periods 
our first and fourth quarter results typically reflect this seasonality 
in addition  particularly harsh weather conditions may result in temporary slowdowns or suspension of certain of our operations or higher labor and operational costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents if we lose our senior management or are unable to attract highly skilled personnel  we may be unable to successfully pursue our growth strategy we are highly dependent on the experience  abilities and continued efforts of our senior management team 
the loss of one or more of our senior management team could limit our ability to execute our growth strategy 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled personnel in various areas of our business 
our inability to attract new high quality employees could also limit our ability to carry out our growth strategy 
our canadian operations subject us to currency translation risk  which could cause our results to fluctuate significantly from period to period for the year ended december   most of our revenue was derived from our operations in canada and as such our primary functional currency is the canadian dollar 
however  for each reporting period  we translate the results of our canadian operations and financial condition into us dollars 
therefore  our reported results of operations and financial condition are subject to changes in the exchange relationship between the two currencies 
for example  as the relationship of the canadian dollar strengthened against the us dollar  as it did in  our revenue is favorably affected and conversely expenses are unfavorably affected 
the effects of translation are reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
separately  monetary assets denominated in us dollars held by our canadian operations are re measured from us dollars into canadian dollars and then translated into us dollars 
the effects of re measurement are reported currently as a component of net income loss 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
any failure to maintain the required financial assurance or insurance to support existing or future service contracts may prevent us from meeting our contractual obligations  and we might be unable to bid on new contracts or retain existing contracts resulting in reduced operating revenue and earnings municipal solid waste services contracts and permits to operate transfer stations  landfills and recycling facilities typically require us to obtain performance bonds  letters of credit or other means of financial assurance to secure our contractual performance 
such contracts and permits also typically require us to maintain adequate insurance coverage 
our ability to obtain performance bonds or letters of credit is generally dependent on our creditworthiness 
in addition  substantially all of our bonding requirements are provided by one surety for our canadian operations and another surety in the united states for our us operations 
our bonding arrangements are generally renewed annually 
if we are unable to renew our bonding arrangements on favorable terms or at all or enter into arrangements with new surety providers  we would be unable to meet our existing contractual obligations that require the posting of performance bonds  and we would be unable to bid on new contracts 
this would reduce our operating revenue and our earnings 
changes to patterns regarding disposal of waste could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the volume of waste available for collection and thus reducing our earnings waste reduction programs may reduce the volume of waste available for collection in some areas where we operate 
some areas in which we operate offer alternatives to landfill disposal  such as recycling and composting 
in addition  provincial  state and local authorities increasingly mandate recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste  such as yard waste  at landfills 
any significant adverse change in regulation or patterns regarding disposal of waste could have a material adverse effect on our earnings by reducing the level of demand for our services  resulting in decreased revenue and the earnings we are able to generate 

table of contents we may not meet our growth objectives if we are unable to develop new landfill sites or enter into agreements that provide us with access to landfill sites and increased disposal costs could result in reduced profitability and cash flow our ability to meet our growth objectives depends in part on our ability to acquire  lease or expand landfills  develop new landfill sites or enter into agreements that will give us long term access to landfill sites in our markets 
in some areas in which we operate  suitable land for new sites or expansion of existing landfill sites may be unavailable 
permits to expand landfills are often not approved until the remaining permitted disposal capacity of a landfill is very low 
we may not be able to purchase additional landfill sites  renew the permits for or expand existing landfill sites or negotiate or renegotiate agreements to obtain a long term advantage for landfill costs 
if we were to exhaust our permitted capacity at our landfills  our ability to expand internally could be limited  and we could be required to cap and close our landfills and dispose of collected waste at more distant landfills or at landfills operated by our competitors or other third parties 
in alberta  canada  regulations require landfills to be re approved every years  thereby providing the regulator an opportunity to add potentially more stringent or costly design or operating conditions to the permit or prevent the renewal of the permit 
our landfill located in alberta  canada must complete this re approval process by october any failure by us to secure favorable arrangements through ownership of landfills or otherwise for the disposal of collected waste would increase our disposal costs and could result in the loss of business to competitors with more favorable disposal options thereby reducing our profitability and cash flow 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes in the landfill site permitting process 
these changes could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain or renew landfill permits 
technical design requirements  as approved  may need modification at some future point in time  which could result in higher development and construction costs than projected 
our current estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in design requirements prescribed by legislation  construction requirements and changes in the expected waste density over the life of a landfill site 
the density of waste used to convert the available airspace at a landfill into tons may be different than estimated because of variations in operating conditions  including waste compaction practices  site design  climate and the nature of the waste 
limits on export of waste and any disruptions to the cross border flow of waste may adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs of disposal there is limited disposal capacity available in ontario  canada  a market in which we have significant operations 
as a result  a significant portion of the solid waste collected in ontario is transported to sites in the united states for disposal 
disruptions in the cross border flow of waste  or periodic closures of the border to solid waste would cause us to incur more costs due to the increased time our trucks may be required to spend at border check points or increased processing or sorting requirements 
additionally  our trucks might be required to travel further to dispose of their waste in other areas of ontario 
disruptions in the cross border flow of waste could also result in a lack of disposal capacity available to our ontario market at a reasonable price or at all 
these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by increasing our costs of disposal in the ontario market and thereby decreasing our operating margins and could result in the loss of business to competitors with more favorable disposal options

item legal proceedings in the normal course of our business and as a result of the extensive governmental regulation of the solid waste industry  we may periodically become subject to various judicial and administrative proceedings involving federal  provincial  state or local agencies 
in these proceedings  an agency may seek to impose fines on us or revoke or deny renewal of an operating permit or license that is required for our operations 
from time to time  we may also be subject to actions brought by citizens groups or adjacent landowners or residents in connection with the permitting and licensing of transfer stations and landfills or alleging environmental damage or violations of the permits and licenses pursuant to which we operate 
we may become party to various lawsuits pending for alleged damages to persons and property  alleged violations of certain laws and alleged liabilities arising out of matters occurring during the normal operation of a solid waste management business 
in december  canadian waste services inc  or canadian waste  one of our competitors  commenced an action in the court of queen s bench of alberta against us and one of our employees in western canada who had previously been employed by canadian waste 
the action alleges breach of the employment contract between the employee and canadian waste  and breach of fiduciary duties 
the action also alleges that we participated in those alleged breaches 
the action seeks damages in the amount of approximately c million  and an injunction enjoining the employee from acting contrary to his alleged employment contract and fiduciary duties 
on february   canadian waste commenced an action in the court of queen s bench of alberta against us alleging breach of a landfill tipping agreement that we had entered into with canadian waste 
the action alleges that we have breached the agreement by not paying certain amounts invoiced to us by canadian waste relating to increased costs incurred by canadian waste in its operation of the ryley landfill and at which we deposited certain quantities of waste pursuant to the agreement 
canadian waste seeks damages in the amount of approximately c million 
the agreement contains an arbitration clause that prohibits court action and requires arbitration with respect to certain disputes 
we intend to vigorously defend these actions both with respect to liability and damages  and no provisions have been made in these financial statements for the above matters 
no statements of defense have been filed  and documents have not yet been exchanged 
as of the date of this report  we do not believe that the reasonably possible losses in respect of all or any of these matters would have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based on  and should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this annual report 
overview we are a multi regional  integrated solid waste services company  providing collection  transfer  landfill disposal and recycling services for commercial  industrial and residential customers in the united states and canada 
in  we initiated a disposal based growth strategy to enter the us solid waste market and establish  vertically integrated market positions 
under this strategy  we enter geographic markets with attractive growth or competitive characteristics by acquiring and developing landfill disposal capacity  then acquiring and developing waste collection and transfer operations 
in the past months  we have implemented this strategy by acquiring large municipal solid waste landfill developments and collection operations in three geographic markets in the united states northern and central florida  including orlando  tampa and jacksonville  phoenix and tucson  arizona  and houston  texas 
we have acquired large municipal solid waste landfill developments in each of these markets 
as part of our business strategy to expand into the us  we intend to enter into a migration transaction the migration transaction 
under the migration transaction  our corporate structure will be reorganized so that waste services  inc waste services  currently a subsidiary of capital  will become the parent company of our corporate group 
we were founded in may and began operations in june when we acquired selected solid waste assets and operations in canada from canadian waste services inc from the time of commencing operations  we acquired a number of solid waste service operations in canada and the us in the first half of  we sold our operations in the northeastern united states and exited the us market because those us operations were exclusively collection operations  with no related disposal opportunity and did not provide sufficient cash flow and investment returns 
our corporate strategy changed substantially in september when we appointed our current chairman and ceo  david sutherland yoest  and our new board members 
our new management and 
table of contents board of directors identified an opportunity to create a multi regional  vertically integrated solid waste company by expanding into high growth markets in the us since september  we have raised in excess of million in various private equity placements pursuing this strategy and have invested in three newly permitted or to be permitted large landfill disposal facilities strategically located in what we believe to be high growth us markets 
sources of revenue our revenue consists primarily of fees charged to customers for solid waste collection  landfill disposal  transfer and recycling services 
we expect our percentage mix of landfill and transfer station revenue to increase in relative to our collection revenue as we commence commercial operations at our landfills in florida  arizona and texas 
our revenue mix for the year ended december  is as follows actual collection landfill disposal transfer station material recovery facilities other specialized services total we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenue from services provided to commercial  industrial and residential customers that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
we recognize revenue when services are rendered 
amounts billed to customers prior to providing the related services are reflected as deferred revenue and reported as revenue in the periods in which the services are rendered 
we provide collection services for commercial and industrial customers under one to three year service agreements 
we determine the fees we charge our customers based on a variety of factors  including collection frequency  level of service  route density  the type  volume and weight of the waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged by competitors for similar services 
our contracts with commercial and industrial customers typically allow us to pass on increased costs resulting from variable items such as disposal and fuel costs and surcharges 
our ability to pass on price increases is sometimes limited by the terms of our contracts 
we provide residential waste collection services through a variety of contractual arrangements  including contracts with municipalities  landlords and homeowners associations or subscription arrangements with homeowners 
our contracts with municipalities are typically for a term of up to five years and contain a formula  generally based on a pre determined published price index  for automatic adjustments to fees to cover increases in some  but not all  of our operating costs 
certain of our contracts with municipalities contain renewal provisions 
the fees we charge for residential solid waste collection services provided on a subscription basis are based primarily on route density  the frequency and level of service  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing and prices we charge in the market for similar services 
we charge our landfill and transfer station customers a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our transfer stations and landfills 
we generally base our landfill tipping fees on market factors and the type and weight of or volume of the waste deposited 
we generally base our transfer station tipping fees on market factors and the cost of processing the waste deposited at the transfer station  the cost of transporting the waste to a disposal facility and the cost of disposal 

table of contents material recovery facilities generate revenue from the sale of recyclable commodities 
in an effort to reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations on recycled materials  where competitive pressures permit  we charge collection or processing fees for recycling volume collected from our customers 
expense structure our cost of operations primarily includes tipping fees and related disposal costs  labor and related benefit costs  equipment maintenance  fuel  vehicle insurance and landfill closure and post closure costs 
our strategy is to create vertically integrated operations in each of our markets which will allow us to internalize our own collection volume into our landfills and transfer stations 
internalization lowers our disposal costs by allowing us to eliminate tipping fees otherwise paid to an independent landfill operator 
we believe internalization provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to be a low cost provider in our markets 
historically  our internalization has been relatively low 
however  we expect our internalization will increase in and beyond in connection with our disposal based acquisition strategy and our recent landfill acquisitions in florida  arizona and texas 
we expect that as our internalization increases our operating margins will improve 
in markets where we do not have our own landfills  we seek to secure long term disposal arrangements with municipalities or private owners of landfills or transfer stations 
in these markets  our ability to maintain competitive prices for our collection services is generally dependent upon our ability to secure low cost disposal pricing 
if owners of third party disposal sites discontinue our arrangements  we would have to seek alternative disposal sites which could impact our profitability and cash flow 
in addition  if third party disposal sites increase their tipping fees and we are unable to pass these increases on to our collection customers  our profitability and cash flow would be negatively impacted 
we believe the age and condition of a fleet has a significant impact on operating costs including  but not limited to  repairs and maintenance  insurance and driver training and retention costs 
through capital investment  we seek to maintain an average fleet age of five to six years 
we believe this enables us to minimize our repair and maintenance costs  safety and insurance costs and employee turnover related costs 
selling  general and administrative expense includes managerial costs  information systems  sales force  administrative expenses and professional fees 
we have made a significant investment in information systems and in assembling our management team to support our growth strategy 
as such  our selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of our revenue has increased over prior periods 
we expect selling  general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of revenue as we complete and integrate acquisitions and commence operations at our new landfill sites 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method  depletion of landfill costs  including closure and post closure obligations  using life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method  and amortization of intangible assets including customer relationships and contracts and covenants not to compete which are amortized over the expected benefit to be received by such intangibles 
we capitalize certain third party costs related to pending acquisitions or development projects 
these costs remain deferred until we cease to be engaged on a regular and ongoing basis with completion of the proposed acquisition  at which point they are charged currently in earnings 
in the event that the target is acquired  these costs are incorporated in the cost of the acquired business 
we currently expense indirect and internal costs including executive salaries  overhead and travel costs related to acquisitions 
florida completed and pending acquisitions jed landfill  osceola county 
in may  we acquired the jed landfill  a newly permitted landfill in central florida for million in cash  assumed liabilities of million and the issuance of  common shares 
the landfill site  which began commercial operations in january  is a  acre municipal solid waste landfill with an initial permitted capacity of million cubic yards 
we 
table of contents plan to pursue a vertical expansion that would increase the initial permitted capacity by approximately million cubic yards 
allied northern and central florida operations 
in november  we entered into an agreement to acquire from allied  the assets of allied s northern and central florida operations for a purchase price of approximately million plus working capital 
the primary markets currently serviced by the operations are in tampa  sarasota and jacksonville  florida 
to date  we have acquired all operations except for certain operations in jacksonville which we expect to complete in may upon receipt of the required municipal contract transfer consents and approvals 
florida recycling services  central florida 
in november  we entered into an agreement  as amended in march  to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of florida recycling for a purchase price of million in cash  subject to certain changes in working capital  and the issuance of  common shares 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including financing conditions 
as part of this transaction  we have advanced deposits of million in cash and  in common shares 
if the closing is not completed on or before may  we are required to make an additional advance of million and the sellers may terminate the agreement  at which point we would forfeit all cash and common share advances 
florida recycling s operations are based in central florida  primarily servicing the orlando  daytona  fort myers and tampa markets and will provide substantial internalization benefits to our jed landfill 
separately  one of our officers holds a equity interest in florida recycling  which was acquired prior to his employment with us 
in addition  under an agreement with the sellers entered into prior to his employment with us  this officer will receive a fee of approximately million from the sellers upon closing of the transaction 
see item certain relationships and related transactions 
arizona acquisitions cactus waste landfill  pinal county 
in july  we purchased cactus waste systems  llc  or cactus waste  for million in cash and a million option  which we exercised in september  to purchase an acre site in pinal county  arizona  which has been zoned to permit the development of a landfill 
we expect the cactus waste landfill site  which will serve the greater phoenix and tucson  arizona markets  to have a permitted capacity of million cubic yards 
additionally  we are developing a fully permitted transfer station in mesa  arizona 
upon receipt of all permits and authorizations for the operation of the landfill  which we expect to occur in the second quarter of  we will issue  common shares or million to the sellers of cactus waste  at their option 
the sellers are entitled to contingent payments based upon the landfill achieving certain defined average tons of waste per day 
should the landfill achieve a maximum  tons per day  the total contingent payments would not exceed million 
additionally  we entered into a royalty agreement whereby we will pay the sellers a royalty of per ton on all waste deposited at the cactus waste landfill after the earlier to occur of july or the receipt of  tons of waste per day at the landfill 
we currently expect to complete construction and open the landfill and transfer station in the second half of collection businesses  phoenix arizona 
to date  we have acquired the assets of seven collection businesses for aggregate cash consideration of approximately million plus the issuance of  common shares 
texas acquisition long point landfill  fort bend county 
in february  we acquired a new  fully permitted  municipal solid waste landfill site currently under development in fort bend county  texas  approximately miles southwest of metropolitan houston 
the purchase price was comprised of a cash payment of million  a seller financed promissory note of million and the issuance of  common shares 
this approximately  acre site  which will serve the greater houston area  has a permitted capacity of million cubic yards 
it is currently anticipated that the landfill will open for commercial operation in the 
table of contents second half of in addition to the landfill  we acquired a leasehold interest in a fully permitted transfer station site in houston  which we expect to construct and open by the fourth quarter of canadian acquisitions collection business we purchased one solid waste collection company in western canada during for approximately million 
gap disposal  saskatchewan in january  we acquired all outstanding shares of gap disposal  ltd  a permitted industrial waste landfill site in saskatchewan 
the purchase price was comprised of a cash payment of approximately million and the issuance of  common shares 
critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgments or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these areas include allowances for doubtful accounts  landfill airspace  intangible and long lived assets  closure and post closure liabilities  revenue recognition  income taxes and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  our observance of trends in particular areas  information or valuations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual amounts could differ significantly from amounts previously estimated 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity revenue recognition we recognize revenue when services  such as providing collection services and accepting waste at our disposal facilities  are rendered 
amounts billed to customers prior to providing the related services are reflected as deferred revenue and reported as revenue in the period in which the services are rendered 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we specifically analyze accounts receivable and also analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  and various other factors when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if management makes different judgments or uses different estimates 
business acquisitions and goodwill we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
as part of this allocation process  management must identify and attribute values and estimated lives to the 
table of contents intangible assets acquired 
such determinations involve considerable judgment  and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates and asset lives 
these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods 
we fully adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   or sfas no 
we test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
in determining the fair value  we may utilize i discounted future cash flows  ii operating results based upon a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues  iii offers from interested investors  if any  or iv appraisals 
significant estimates used in the fair value calculation utilizing discounted future cash flows include  but are not limited to i estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit ii future estimated effective tax rates  which we estimate to range between and  iii future estimated rate of capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital  iv estimated average cost of capital  which we estimated to range between and  and v the future terminal value of our reporting unit  which is based upon its ability to exist into perpetuity 
significant estimates used in the fair value calculation utilizing market value multiples include but are not limited to i estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit  ii estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay  and iii estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 
in the first quarter of  we performed the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill based on the carrying values as of january  as a result of performing the test for potential impairment  we determined that no impairment existed as of january  we performed the goodwill impairment test during and and also determined that no goodwill impairment existed for these periods 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of the acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with the acquired businesses is impaired 
additionally  as the valuation of identifiable goodwill requires significant estimates and judgment about future performance  cash flows and fair value  our future results could be affected if these current estimates of future performance and fair value change 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of property and equipment or whether the remaining balance of property and equipment  or other long lived assets including amortizing intangible assets  should be evaluated for possible impairment 
instances that may lead to an impairment include i a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset group  ii a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  iii a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset or asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iv an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset or asset group  v a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  or vi a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
we use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest  over the remaining life of the property and equipment and long lived assets in assessing their recoverability 
we measure impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset s exceeds the fair value of the 
table of contents asset s 
we primarily employ two methodologies for determining the fair value of a long lived asset i the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties or ii the present value of estimated expected future cash flows grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable independent cash flows 
landfill sites landfill sites are recorded at cost 
capitalized landfill costs include expenditures for land  permitting costs  cell construction costs and environmental structures 
capitalized permitting and cell construction costs are limited to direct costs relating to these activities  including legal  engineering and construction costs associated with excavation  liners and site beams  leachate management facilities and other costs associated with environmental management equipment and structures 
costs related to acquiring land  excluding the estimated residual value of un permitted  non buffer land  and costs related to permitting and cell construction are depleted as airspace is consumed using the units of consumption method 
environmental structures  which include leachate collection systems  methane collection systems and groundwater monitoring wells  are charged to expense over the shorter of their useful life or the life of the landfill 
capitalized landfill costs may also include an allocation of the purchase price paid for landfills 
for landfills purchased as part of a group of several assets  the purchase price assigned to the landfill is determined based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group 
if the landfill meets our expansion criteria  the purchase price is further allocated between permitted airspace and expansion airspace based upon the ratio of permitted versus probable expansion airspace to total available airspace 
landfill sites are amortized using the units of consumption method over the total available airspace including probable expansion airspace where appropriate 
we assess the carrying value of our landfill sites in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
these provisions  as well as possible instances that may lead to impairment  are addressed in long lived assets 
there are certain indicators previously discussed that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion 
we identified three sequential steps that landfills generally follow to obtain expansion permits 
these steps are as follows i obtaining approval from local authorities  ii submitting a permit application to state or provincial authorities  and iii obtaining permit approval from state or provincial authorities 
before expansion airspace is included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  the following criteria must be met i the land associated with the expansion airspace is either owned by us or is controlled by us pursuant to an option agreement  ii we are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources  iii there are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project  including political impediments  iv progress is being made on the project  v the expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame  and vi based upon senior management s review of the status of the permit process to date we believe it is more likely than not the expansion permit will be received within the next five years 
upon meeting our expansion criteria  the rates used at each applicable landfill to expense costs to acquire  construct  close and maintain a site during the post closure period are adjusted to include probable expansion airspace and all additional costs to be capitalized or accrued associated with the expansion airspace 
once expansion airspace meets the criteria for inclusion in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  management continuously monitors each site s progress in obtaining the expansion permit 
if at any point it is determined that an expansion area no longer meets the required criteria  the probable expansion airspace is removed from the landfill s total available capacity and the rates used at the landfill to expense costs to acquire  construct  close and maintain a site during the post closure period are adjusted accordingly

also excludes our gap disposal landfill and our long point landfill which were acquired in the first quarter of accrued closure and post closure obligations on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to change our methodology used to record liabilities related to final capping  closure and post closure of our landfill operations 
under the provisions of the new statement  we recognized  as an asset  the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation 
the asset is then depleted  consistently with other capitalized landfill costs  over the remaining useful life of the site based upon units of consumption as airspace in the landfill is consumed 
additionally  we recognized a liability for the present value of the estimated future 
table of contents asset retirement obligation 
the liability will be adjusted for i additional liabilities incurred or settled  ii accretion of the liability to its future value and iii revisions in the estimated cash flows relative to closure and post closure costs 
accrued closure and post closure obligations represent an estimate of the future obligation associated with closure and post closure monitoring of the non hazardous solid waste landfills owned by us 
site specific closure and post closure engineering cost estimates are prepared for the landfills we own 
the impact of changes in estimates  based on an annual update  is accounted for on a prospective basis 
we calculate closure and post closure liabilities by estimating the total future obligation in current dollars  inflating the obligations based upon the expected date of the expenditure using an inflation rate of and discounting the inflated total to its present value using an credit adjusted risk free discount rate 
accretion of discounted cash flows associated with the closure and post closure obligations is accrued over the estimated life of the landfill 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  property  plant and equipment and losses for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets  which include tax loss carry forwards  and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not likely or there is insufficient operating history  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established or increased in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision of the consolidated statement of operations 
operating results results of operations for the three years ended december   and the majority of our operations for the three years ended december  were domiciled in canada 
as such  our primary functional currency is the canadian dollar 
however  for each reporting period  we translate the results of our operations and financial condition into us dollars 
therefore  our reported results of operations and financial condition are subject to changes in the exchange relationship between the two currencies 
for example  as the relationship of the canadian dollar strengthens against the us dollar our revenue is favorably affected and conversely our expenses are unfavorably affected 
assets and liabilities of canadian operations have been translated from canadian dollars into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the relevant balance sheet date  and revenue and expenses of canadian operations have been translated from canadian dollars into us dollars at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
unrealized gains and losses on translation of the canadian operations into us dollars are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity and are included in comprehensive income loss 
separately  monetary assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars held by the canadian operation are re measured from us dollars into canadian dollars and then translated into us dollars 
the effects of re measurement are reported currently as a component of net income loss 
we do not hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates

revenue increases were primarily due to new acquisitions   pricing   offset by divestitures of the us collection operations   volume declines   and the unfavorable effects of foreign exchanges movements  approximately 
the 
table of contents majority of the growth in revenue from new acquisitions was due to the acquisition of waste services ottawa which contributed million while divestitures of the us collection operations decreased revenue million 
volume decrease was due to the loss of a national brokerage customer  a reduction in compactor sales  the loss of three municipal contracts for residential collection and a loss of revenue from closing a transfer station

the increase in canadian operating costs was primarily the result of new waste collection agreements 
we expect our cost of operations to increase on a year over year basis in primarily due to acquisitions and the opening of operations at our new landfill sites 
cost of operations was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  cost of operations was for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue was primarily related to the sale of the us operations during  eliminating lower margin us operations and replacing them with higher margin landfill operations with the purchase of waste services ottawa 
excluding the us operations  cost of operations as a percentage of revenue decreased from to primarily due to lower disposal costs associated with the waste services ottawa acquisition

we expect to complete our migration in the first half of also included in selling  general and administrative expense was non 
table of contents cash compensation expense related to warrants issued to an executive officer in for which variable accounting applies 
stock based compensation expense  which was based partially on changes in our stock price  was million versus million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange movements were 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue will decline in primarily due to the acquisition and integration of the allied assets and florida recycling 
selling  general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the million increase in selling  general and administrative expense resulted from increases in management  sales  and administrative personnel and related costs associated with our growth strategy 
stock based compensation expense was million versus million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we incurred million of expenses associated with settlements of lawsuits  failed acquisitions  change in control  restructuring costs and various other associated costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization for the three years ended december   and by geographic segment is as follows in thousands canada united states depreciation  depletion and amortization was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  depreciation  depletion and amortization was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization of million or was due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange movements of  depreciation on our trucks and containers of  depletion of approximately  depreciation at our newly acquired us operations of and amortization and other of 
depreciation on our trucks and containers increased primarily due to an increase in our fleet size and number of containers 
depletion increased primarily due to increased disposal volumes as well as depleting of costs related to our closure and post closure obligations 
landfill depletion rates during the year ended december  for our two canadian operating landfills ranged from c to c per tonne 
we had no operating landfills in the united states during for the year ended december   landfill depletion rates ranged from c to c per tonne 
we expect amortization of intangible assets to increase as a result of our acquisition of the northern and central florida assets of allied and other acquisitions 
depreciation  depletion and amortization was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue depreciation  depletion and amortization was for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the composition of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense changed as there was an approximately million reduction in goodwill amortization between and as a result of our adoption of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
this was offset by depletion of the newly acquired waste services ottawa landfill  depreciation of new capital expenditures and amortization of customer contracts and lists 

table of contents loss recovery related to disposal of us operations the years ended december  and included a recovery of million and million  respectively  on the disposal of the us collection operations related to the settlement of a lease obligation and the payment of a receivable and receipt of a hold back payment  all of which had been provisioned for in during the year ended december   we recognized a loss on the disposal of the us collection operations of million 
foreign exchange loss gain and other foreign exchange loss gain and other was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the foreign exchange loss in was the result of re measuring us dollar denominated cash balances into canadian dollars 
the foreign exchange gains in were the result of re measuring our us dollar denominated debt balances into canadian dollars 
as part of the june refinancing of our senior credit facility  our us dollar denominated debt was repaid 
interest expense the components of interest expense for the three years ended december   and  are as follows in thousands preferred stock dividends and amortization of issue costs credit facility interest amortization of debt issue costs other interest expense was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense of million  or in excess of  was due primarily to the accrual of preferred stock dividends related to waste services shares of cumulative mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  or waste services preferred stock  including amortization of discount and issue costs of approximately million 
separately  as a result of refinancing our previous senior credit facilities in the fourth quarter of  we expensed the then remaining debt issue costs of million 
the slightly higher average borrowings over the relative period were offset primarily by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate excluding amortization of deferred financing expense 
for the year ended december   the weighted average interest rate was as compared to for the year ended december  we expect interest expense will increase on a year over year basis primarily due to increased borrowings to finance our growth plans 
we incurred and capitalized million of issue costs relative to our existing credit facility  which are being charged to interest expense over the day life of the facility in if we are successful in refinancing the existing credit facility in  any remaining capitalized issue costs will be fully amortized at such time 
see liquidity and capital resources 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense of million was due primarily to lower average debt balances outstanding and lower interest rates 
during the year ended december   the average debt outstanding was approximately million lower than that for the year ended december  in addition  the weighted average interest rate excluding amortization of deferred financing expense for the year ended december   was as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of the lower fixed margin rate for canadian eurodollar rate loans charged under the senior credit facility compared to the rate that was charged under the previous senior debt facility 

table of contents income tax provision benefit the reconciliation of the difference between income taxes at the statutory rate and the income tax provision benefit before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the three years ended december   and is as follows in thousands tax provision benefit at combined federal and provincial state statutory rates effect of lower tax rates applicable to us income effect of change in enacted rates on deferred taxes non deductible warrant expense non deductible interest expense and preferred stock dividends non deductible foreign exchange gains and losses other non deductible expense valuation allowance large corporations tax income tax provision benefit as of december   we had million of gross net operating loss carry forwards  of which  million related to us operations 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for the amount of net operating loss carry forwards expiring in each future year 
we have determined that the realization of the future tax benefit related to the canadian loss carryforwards totaling million is more likely than not and accordingly  have not provided a tax valuation allowance against the benefit of these tax loss carryforwards as they are expected to be utilized through future operations and certain tax planning strategies 
due to the start up nature of our us operations  we have provided a valuation allowance for our net operating loss carryforwards generated in the united states 
separately  changes in our ownership structure may result in limitations on the utilization of loss carry forwards  as imposed by section of the us internal revenue code 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements are to fund capital expenditures  primarily related to landfill site development  business and asset acquisitions and debt service 
significant sources of liquidity are cash on hand  net working capital  borrowings from our existing credit facilities  our ability to issue performance bonds and letters of credit  as well as proceeds from equity issuances 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million and net working capital deficit  defined as current assets less restricted cash and current liabilities was million 
as of december   restricted cash representing funds held in escrow to finance the acquisition of certain assets from allied totaled million 
as of december   prepaid expenses and other assets included million of cash collateral deposits for letters of credit 
our existing credit facilities described further in this section have been included in the calculation of net working capital deficit as of december  we intend to refinance our existing credit facilities through the issuance of more permanent debt and or equity securities 
we expect to expand our business through acquisitions of existing businesses and landfill sites domiciled in the united states and canada 
we expect that we will fund these business acquisitions through cash on hand  issuances of our common shares and other external sources of financing which may include  but not be limited to  certain debt and equity offerings 

table of contents existing credit facilities in december  our us subsidiary waste services entered into the million senior secured credit facilities comprised of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility  which is secured by substantially all of our current and future acquired assets 
initial borrowings under the existing credit facilities were used to finance the acquisition of certain assets of allied and to repay our prior senior credit facility in full 
currently  the existing facilities bear interest at per annum and have an initial term of days with an extension option 
if the option is exercised  the term of the existing credit facilities would extend to july at a rate of per annum 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the term loan with no amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility 
we intend to refinance our existing credit facilities with other sources of financing  which may include but not be limited to new senior credit facilities  a subordinated note offering and other debt or equity offerings 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining alternative sources of funding to refinance this obligation or that any funding will be obtainable on terms that are favorable to us 
as such  we may incur greater interest expense and financing costs in future periods 
if we are unable to refinance the existing credit facilities or otherwise obtain alternative sources of funding we may be required to sell additional debt  equity  or assets in order to meet our repayment obligations  which may not be possible 
the existing credit facilities contain certain financial and other covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things  make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness  incur liens  dispose of property  repay debt  pay dividends  repurchase shares and make certain acquisitions 
our financial covenants primarily relate to i a maximum leverage ratio  ii a minimum interest coverage ratio and iii a minimum ebitda  as defined in the agreement governing the existing credit facilities 
the following table sets forth our financial covenant levels for each of the next four quarters in thousands of us dollars maximum minimum minimum consolidated consolidated interest consolidated fiscal quarter leverage ratio coverage ratio ebitda fq fq fq fq based upon a trailing twelve month period  subject to adjustment for certain acquisitions 
these covenants and restrictions limit the manner in which we conduct our operations and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital 
any failure by us to comply with these covenants and restrictions will  unless waived by the lenders  result in an inability to borrow under the existing credit facilities or an immediate obligation to repay all amounts outstanding 
in such event  we would be required to refinance our debt or obtain capital from other sources  including sales of additional debt or equity or sales of assets  in order to meet our repayment obligations  which may not be possible 
previous senior credit facility repaid in full on december  in june  we completed a refinancing of our former senior debt facility by entering into a new senior secured credit facility  or our senior credit facility  with a syndicate of financial institutions 
the senior credit facility was a revolving credit facility denominated in canadian dollars and provided for borrowings of up to the lesser of million or c million  as amended in the senior credit facility was collateralized by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our current and future acquired assets and those of our subsidiaries 
the senior credit facility contained certain financial and other covenants that restricted our ability to  among other things  make capital expenditures  pay dividends  repurchase shares and make certain acquisitions 
interest rates were based on current market rates plus a fixed margin based on the form of borrowing canadian eurodollar or prime 
the fixed margins ranged from to per annum for canadian eurodollar rate loans and to 
table of contents per annum for prime rate loans 
within the ranges  the fixed margin was determined based on our leverage ratio 
the interest rate on the senior credit facility prior to its repayment was per annum compared to per annum as of december  cumulative mandatorily redeemable shares of preferred stock in may  our us subsidiary waste services issued  shares of preferred stock  or waste services preferred stock  to kelso investment associates vi  lp and kep vi  llc  or kelso  pursuant to the terms of an agreement dated as of may   as amended  or the waste services subscription agreement  at a price of  per share 
waste services also issued to kelso  warrants to purchase shares of common stock on a one for one basis of waste services for per share 
the warrants are exercisable at any time following our migration transaction  as further described in item key information 
the issuance of the waste services preferred stock resulted in proceeds of approximately million  net of fees of approximately million 
the shares of waste services preferred stock are non voting 
the waste services preferred stock entitles the holders to a liquidation preference of  per share and a cumulative cash dividend of per annum compounding and accruing quarterly in arrears 
the liquidation preference approximated million as of december  as we are not permitted to declare and pay cash dividends pursuant to the terms of the existing credit facilities  the dividend payments will accrue 
the waste services preferred stock  including all accrued and unpaid dividends  must be redeemed in full by no later than may  until may   we may redeem all or any part of the waste services preferred stock on payment of the sum of  per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends calculated as if the waste services preferred stock were redeemed on may  or approximately million 
if we do not exercise the option to redeem all of the waste services preferred stock by may   kelso may require waste services to initiate a sale of waste services or its assets on terms acceptable to its board of directors consistent with the exercise by the board members of their fiduciary obligations 
under the waste services subscription agreement  which we amended in february  if we do not complete the migration transaction by june   the dividend payable on the waste services preferred stock issued to kelso will increase by per annum  from  for every month that the migration transaction is delayed  up to a maximum increase of an additional per annum 
we may also be required to issue to kelso an additional  warrants per month for each month that the migration transaction is delayed after june   up to an additional  warrants to purchase waste services common stock  at an exercise price of per share 
the increase in the dividend payable on the waste services preferred stock issued to kelso would increase the amount to be paid to kelso on the redemption of the waste services preferred stock and would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
by the terms of the agreement  as amended  if the migration transaction is not completed at all  kelso may also require us to exchange the existing  warrants to purchase common stock of waste services  and any of the additional warrants for common stock of waste services issued as a result of our completing the migration transaction after june   for warrants to purchase our common shares 
additionally  kelso  as the holder of the waste services preferred stock  has the exclusive right to elect two directors of waste services so long as  or more shares of waste services preferred stock are outstanding  or one director so long as there are  or more shares of waste services preferred stock outstanding 
certain actions of waste services and its affiliates  including incurring certain indebtedness  also require the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the waste services preferred stock 
all of these covenants and restrictions could limit the manner in which we conduct our operations and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital 
any failure by us to comply with these covenants and restrictions will  unless waived by kelso  result in an immediate obligation to redeem all of the then outstanding waste services preferred stock 
if such events occurred  we would be required to refinance waste services or obtain capital from other sources  including sales of additional debt or equity or the sale of assets  in order to meet our redemption obligations 

table of contents we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  and accordingly classified the waste services preferred stock as a liability 
we also allocated the relative fair value of the proceeds to the waste services preferred stock and warrants 
the  warrants have an allocated value on the date of issue of approximately million 
the value allocated to the warrants was treated as a component of equity  with an offsetting amount treated as a discount which will accrete to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the waste services preferred stock to the earliest redemption date of may  surety bonding and letters of credit municipal solid waste services contracts  permits and licenses to operate transfer stations and recycling facilities may require performance or surety bonds  letters of credit or other means of financial assurance to secure contractual performance 
as of december   we had provided customers and various regulatory authorities with such bonds and letters of credit amounting to approximately million to collateralize our obligations 
if we were unable to obtain performance or surety bonds or letters of credit in sufficient amounts or at acceptable rates  we could be precluded from entering into additional municipal solid waste services contracts or obtaining or retaining landfill  transfer station  recycling facility or operating permits and licenses 
we expect that our surety and letter of credit needs will increase as we continue to expand through acquisitions or internal growth 
we expect that as a result of acquiring the northern and central florida assets of allied  we will need to obtain additional performance or surety bonds of approximately million 
equity issuances common shares in march  we issued  common shares as part of the purchase price of the jed landfill  located in osceola county  florida 
in conjunction with the jed landfill acquisition  we issued  common shares in consideration for transaction related services 
in november  we issued  common shares pursuant to the florida recycling acquisition as a deposit into escrow 
in december  we issued  common shares as part of the purchase price on the acquisition of a phoenix  arizona collection business 
during the first quarter of  we issued a total of  common shares as part of the purchase price for certain acquisitions in the united states and canada 
series preferred shares the following table sets forth the varied tranches of series preferred shares issued during  all of which were converted to common shares amounts in thousands except share and per share amounts number of number of warrant series price per gross net warrants exercise price period preferred shares share proceeds proceeds issued per share march june june a july b september b    c  a the proceeds from this issue were received and recorded as of june   the series shares were issued july  
table of contents b a shareholder and certain of our officers and directors and their affiliates  purchased  series preferred shares in these private placement transactions 
c separately  we recorded a tax asset of million for the deductible portion of the fees paid 
we account for the issuance of the series preferred shares as the issuance of three differing securities i series preferred shares convertible into common shares  ii warrants exercisable for common shares  and iii a beneficial conversion feature embedded in the series preferred shares 
the gross proceeds from the offering were allocated based upon the relative fair value of the series preferred shares on the commitment date date of issue  and the warrants 
the fair value of the common shares at the commitment date was compared to the gross proceeds allocated to the series preferred shares based upon their relative fair value 
the excess of fair value of the common shares over the gross proceeds allocated to the series preferred shares was deemed to be the value associated with the beneficial conversion feature of the series preferred shares and was recorded as a non cash dividend on the series preferred shares 
value ascribed to the beneficial conversion feature of the series preferred shares and the allocated fair value of the warrants approximated million for the year ended december   which was recognized as a deemed dividend to the series preferred shareholders 
at our annual meeting held in december  the shareholders voted in favor of the conversion of the series preferred shares to common shares thereby effecting the conversion on the basis of one common share for each series preferred share held and the exercisability of the warrants that were issued with the series preferred shares 
exercise of warrants and options during the year ended december   we issued  common shares on the exercise of warrants and options for cash proceeds of approximately million 
cash flows the following discussion relates to the major components of the changes in cash flows for the years ended december  and cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to increase overhead spending  as previously discussed  partly offset by increased cash from our working capital 
cash flows used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used in investing activities during was primarily due to our acquisition activity 
during the year ended december   we purchased certain assets from allied for million  all the membership interests in the entity which owns the jed landfill for million in cash  and we acquired a number of smaller companies for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately million 
capital expenditures also increased by million for the year ended december  versus primarily due to increased spending related to landfill development  and in the prior year  approximately million in capital expenditures was financed with capital leases 
in addition  cash deposits for pending business acquisitions increased million over the prior year 
we expect our capital expenditures to increase as a result of acquisitions and continued development of our recently acquired landfill sites 
we currently anticipate our capital expenditures  including capital expenditures for our recent acquisitions  in the range of approximately to million in this amount is subject to change based on the timing and extent of our acquisitions in we intend to 
table of contents finance capital expenditures and business acquisitions through operating cash flow  borrowings under our existing credit facilities and the issuance of equity and other debt securities 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  as previously discussed  the increase in cash flows from financing activities is primarily due to proceeds from our existing credit facilities and the issuance of series preferred shares  waste services preferred stock  and our common shares  the proceeds of which were primarily used to finance acquisitions and repayment of our previous senior secured credit facility 
in  we incurred the following fees in connection with financing activities in thousands debt issue costs relative to the existing credit facilities waste services preferred stock issue costs series preferred shares issue costs debt issue costs relative to the previous senior credit facility total new accounting pronouncements we will be impacted by the adoption of new accounting pronouncements  details of which are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this annual report 
recent significant changes are as follows in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  or sfas no 
 effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a freestanding financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
and as a result  have classified the waste services preferred stock as a liability 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 or fin in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin  or revised interpretation  to clarify some of the provisions of fin fin provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity  or vie  and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a vie must be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity is required to consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vies expected losses or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if any 
vies created after january   but prior to january   may be accounted for either based on the original interpretation or the revised interpretations 
however  the revised interpretations must be applied no later than the first quarter of fiscal year vies created after january   must be accounted under the revised interpretations 
there has been no material impact to our financial statements from potential vies entered into after january   and there is no expected impact from the adoption of the deferred provisions in the first quarter of fiscal year trend information seasonality we expect the results of our canadian operations to vary seasonally  with revenue typically lowest in the first quarter of the year  higher in the second and third quarters  and lower in the fourth quarter than 
table of contents in the third quarter 
the seasonality is attributable to a number of factors 
first  less solid waste is generated during the late fall  winter and early spring because of decreased construction and demolition activity 
second  certain operating costs are higher in the winter months because winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities  resulting in higher labor costs  and rain and snow increase the weight of collected waste  resulting in higher disposal costs  which are calculated on a per ton basis 
also  during the summer months  there are more tourists and part time residents in some of our service areas  resulting in more residential and commercial collection 
consequently  we expect operating income to be generally lower during the winter 
we believe that the effect of seasonality on our results of operations from our us operations  which are located in warmer climates than our canadian operations  will be less significant than that of our canadian operations 
off balance sheet arrangements except as discussed  we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations  other than our performance and surety bonds discussed previously  which are not debt 
we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed  consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position 
we do not guarantee any third party debt 
separately  under a put or pay disposal agreement that we entered into in november  we agreed to deliver to certain landfill sites and transfer stations of intersan inc  or intersan  a specified tonnage of waste during the first five year term of the agreement 
we also agreed to deliver a specified tonnage of waste for the two years following the initial term 
if we along with another party to the agreement fail to deliver the required tonnage  we are jointly and severally required to pay to intersan  c per metric tonne for every tonne below the required tonnage 
if a portion of the annual tonnage commitment is not delivered to a specific site  we are also required to pay per metric tonne for every tonne below the site specific allocation 
our obligations to intersan are secured by a letter of credit for c million 
no payments were made or required to be made to intersan pursuant to the put or pay disposal agreement in the period from january  to march  for a further description of this agreement  see item certain relationships and related transactions 
additionally  we do not anticipate material future payments under the put or pay disposal agreement and  accordingly  we have not provided for a liability pursuant to this agreement 
concurrently with the put or pay disposal agreement  we entered into a three year agreement with canadian waste services inc to allow us to deliver up to  tons in year one and up to  tons in years two and three of non hazardous solid waste to their landfill in michigan at negotiated fixed rates per ton 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations we have various commitments primarily related to funding of short term debt  waste services preferred stock  closure and post closure obligations and capital and operating lease commitments 
the 
table of contents following table provides details regarding our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments subsequent to december  in thousands beyond years total contractual cash obligations existing credit facilities capital lease obligations other long term debt operating lease commitments cumulative mandatorily redeemable shares of preferred stock committed amount for construction in progress closure and post closure obligations if we do not refinance our existing credit facilities  we expect cash required to service interest expense for these facilities will approximate or exceed million for this table includes the cumulative mandatorily redeemable shares of preferred stock issued by waste services  which must be redeemed in full no later than may the future payment of million represents the principal  plus accrued dividends at compounded quarterly to may   which is the earliest date kelso may require waste services to repay the obligation 
if we do not redeem by may   kelso may require us to initiate a sale of waste services or its assets on terms acceptable to its board of directors 
future payments on closure and post closure obligations are undiscounted and contemplate full utilization of current and probable expansion airspace 
the amount also excludes the undiscounted value of the closure and post closure obligations of our jed landfill  which began operations in january other contractual arrangements in connection with a certain acquisition and the issuance of the  common shares  we entered into a reimbursement agreement whereby for a period of one year after the second anniversary of the closing date we will reimburse the seller for the loss on sale of shares below per share 
in the normal course of our business  we have other commitments and contingencies relating to environmental and legal matters 
for a further discussion of commitments and contingencies  see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our operations are domiciled in canada 
as such  our primary functional currency is the canadian dollar 
however  for each reporting period  we translate the results of our operations and financial condition into us dollars 
therefore  our reported results of operations and financial condition are subject to changes in the exchange relationship between the two currencies 
for example  as the relationship of the canadian dollar strengthens against the us dollar our revenue is favorably affected and conversely our expenses are unfavorably affected 
assets and liabilities of canadian operations have been translated from canadian dollars into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the relevant balance sheet date  and revenue and expenses of canadian operations have been translated from canadian dollars into us dollars at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
unrealized gains and losses on translation of the canadian operations into us dollars are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity and are included in comprehensive income loss 
separately  monetary assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars held by the canadian operation are re measured from us dollars 
table of contents into canadian dollars and then translated into us dollars 
the effects of re measurement are reported currently as a component of net income loss 
currently  we do not hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
for the year ended december  we estimate that a increase or decrease in the relationship of the canadian dollar to the us dollar would increase or decrease loss from canadian operations by less than million 
for the year ended december  we estimate that a increase or decrease in the relationship of the canadian dollar to the us dollar would increase or decrease loss from canadian operations approximately million 
as of december  we had million of us dollar denominated cash held by our canadian operations 
we estimate that a increase or decrease in the relationship of the canadian dollar to the us dollar would increase or decrease foreign exchange loss or gain by approximately million 
as of december  there were no monetary assets or liabilities denominated in us dollars held by our canadian operations 
as of december  we were not exposed to variable interest rates  however as of december  we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our previous financing facility  which was repaid
