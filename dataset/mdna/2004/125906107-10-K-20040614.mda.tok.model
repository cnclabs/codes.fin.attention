item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
strategic overview the company s business is roughly seasonal christmas  valentines  easter  back to school and halloween products  with the remainder being everyday product sales 
seasonal products are sold primarily to mass market retailers and the company typically has relatively high market shares in many of these categories 
most of these markets have shown little or no growth in recent years and there continues to be significant cost pressure in this area as our competitors source certain products overseas and our customers increase direct sourcing from overseas factories 
increasing customer concentration and bargaining power also contribute to price pressure 
the company is responding to these pressures in a number of ways 
first  we are increasing our investment in product and packaging design and product knowledge to assure we can continue to provide unique added value to our customers 
secondly  we have opened a new office and showroom in the far east to better meet our customers buying needs and to be able to provide alternatively sourced products at competitive prices 
lastly  we increased our focus on efficiency and productivity in our north american production and distribution facilities to assure our competitiveness domestically 
our everyday product lines  principally craft  floral and packaging products  have higher inherent growth potential due to higher market growth rates  particularly in craft  and to our relatively low current market shares 
we have established project teams to pursue top line sales growth in these and other areas 
historically  significant growth at css has come through carefully chosen and executed acquisitions 
management anticipates that it will continue this pursuit in the future  as well 
business acquisitions and divestitures on october   a subsidiary of the company acquired all of the capital stock of crystal for approximately  including transaction costs  and assumed and repaid  of outstanding debt primarily seasonal working capital debt 
during fiscal  the company received cash of approximately  in satisfaction of a post closing adjustment to the purchase price 
crystal  headquartered in middletown  ohio  is a leading designer  manufacturer and distributor of consumer convenience gift wrap products 
its product lines include gift tissue  gift bags  and related packaging products for the consumer market  as well as specialty tissues for in store packaging of retailers and for industrial applications 
a portion of the purchase price is being held in escrow for certain indemnification obligations 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets acquired of  was recorded as intangible assets  including goodwill  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
on march   a subsidiary of the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the business and assets of the portion of offray which manufactures and sells decorative ribbon products  floral accessories and narrow fabrics for apparel  craft and packaging applications 
the company paid approximately  in cash  including transaction costs 
a portion of the purchase price is being held in escrow to cover indemnification obligations 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the cost approximated the fair market value of the net assets acquired 
on may   the company acquired certain assets of tye sil corporation ltd 
of montreal  quebec  canada 
tye sil had been the leading canadian provider of gift wrap and accessories 
the company paid approximately  in cash  including transaction costs 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the cost approximated the fair market value of the net assets acquired 
subsequent to the acquisition  the operations of tye sil were consolidated into existing operations of the company 
litigation on february   a group of six domestic producers of tissue paper and a labor union jointly filed an antidumping duty petition with the international trade administration of the commerce department and the itc 
the petitioners are seeking the imposition of antidumping duties of on certain tissue paper products imported from china 
if successful  the petition could result in the imposition of antidumping duties on gift tissue 
back to contents products that the company imports from china for re sale to the company s customers in the united states 
the company is contesting the petition in proceedings before the itc and the commerce department 
in april  the itc made a preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that a domestic industry is being materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of the imported tissue paper products 
as a result  the commerce department will make a determination as to whether the imported goods are being sold into the united states at less than fair value 
if the commerce department makes preliminary and final determinations in the affirmative  and the itc makes a final determination of material injury or threat of material injury to a domestic industry resulting from the imported tissue paper products  antidumping duties will be imposed for a period of at least five years from the date of itc s order 
in  the company imported from china a substantial portion of the company s requirements for gift tissue products  and the company had planned to import from china substantially all of its requirements for gift tissue products 
while it is not possible for the company to predict the outcome of the itc and commerce department proceedings  the company is considering actions intended to mitigate the adverse impact that would result from the imposition of antidumping duties on gift tissue products that the company imports from china 
in this regard  the company has resumed tissue converting operations at the company s previously closed maysville  kentucky facility  and the company is evaluating sourcing arrangements outside of china 
at this time  the company believes that the imposition of antidumping duties would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in november  bleyer filed suit against css and certain of its subsidiaries in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of nassau 
the suit alleged that css and certain of its subsidiaries misused certain confidential information disclosed by bleyer pursuant to certain confidentiality agreements entered into by css and bleyer 
the relief sought consisted of compensatory damages of approximately  prejudgment interest and punitive damages 
in october  this litigation was dismissed with prejudice 
css and its subsidiaries are also involved in ordinary  routine legal proceedings that are not considered by management to be material 
in the opinion of company counsel and management  the ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the consolidated financial position of the company or its results of operations 
seasonality the seasonal nature of css business results in low sales and in operating losses in the first and fourth quarters and high shipment levels and operating profits in the second and third quarters of the company s fiscal year  thereby causing significant fluctuations in the quarterly results of operations of the company 
because of the seasonality and the general industry practice of deferred payment terms  a material portion of the company s trade receivables are collected in december and january  thus enabling the company to repay the short term debt borrowed to fund the inventory and accounts receivable build up during the year 
stock split on may  the board of directors authorized a three for two common stock split  effected by a distribution on july  of one share for each two shares held of record at the close of business on june  the capital stock accounts  share data and earnings per share data are presented as if the stock split occurred prior to the earliest year included in the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated sales for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales of crystal  acquired on october  excluding crystal  sales declined as improved sales of everyday products were offset by reduced sales of seasonal products caused primarily by the sluggish retail environment

back to contents inflation the financial statements are presented on a historical cost basis and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years inflation 
the us inflation rate has been modest the past several years and the company conducts the majority of its business using the us dollar 
the ability to pass on inflationary costs is uncertain due to general economic conditions and competitive situations 
the company attempts to alleviate inflationary material and labor pressures by increasing selling prices to help offset rising costs subject to competitive conditions  increasing productivity  improving design and manufacturing techniques and improving product sourcing 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had working capital of  and stockholders equity of  the decrease in accounts receivable  net of reserves  from  in to  in was primarily a result of improved collections in the current year 
inventories decreased from  to  due to improved inventory management 
capital expenditures were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and consisted primarily of costs related to the purchase of a new administrative building in berwick  pa and investment in the system integration of offray into berwick 
the company relies primarily on cash generated from its operations and seasonal borrowings to meet its liquidity requirements 
most css revenues are seasonal with approximately of sales being christmas related 
as payment for sales of christmas related products is usually not received until after the holiday in accordance with general industry practice  short term borrowing needs increase throughout the second and third quarters  peaking prior to christmas and dropping thereafter 
seasonal borrowings were made under a  unsecured revolving credit facility with five banks and a  accounts receivable securitization facility with an issuer of receivables backed commercial paper 
on april   the company announced the replacement of its expiring revolving credit facility and the extension of its expiring accounts receivable securitization facility 
the company s expiring  revolving credit facility has been replaced with a  unsecured revolving credit facility with five banks 
this facility expires on april  on june   the company renewed its  accounts receivable securitization facility for a five year period  expiring on july   although it may terminate prior to such date in the event of termination of the commitments of the facility s back up purchasers 
the facility limit now has a seasonally adjusted funding limit of  during peak seasonal periods and  during off peak seasonal periods 
interest on amounts financed under this facility are based on a variable commercial paper rate plus and provides for commitment fees of per annum or the daily average of the unused commitment 
in addition  the company has outstanding  of senior notes due ratably in annual installments over five years beginning in december these financial facilities are available to fund the company s seasonal borrowing needs and to provide the company with sources of capital for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  as permitted under the unsecured revolving credit facility

the total amount of this transaction was

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable reserves  inventory reserves  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingency accruals and litigation accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this form k  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the critical accounting policies and methods used by us 
revenue revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs  which may include special pricing agreements for specific customers  volume incentives and other promotions 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue  based primarily on historical experience  for customer returns and 
back to contents chargebacks that may arise as a result of shipping errors  product damaged in transit or for other reasons that can only become known subsequent to recognizing the revenue 
if the amount of actual customer returns and chargebacks were to increase or decrease significantly from the estimated amount  revisions to the estimated allowance would be required 
accounts receivable the company offers seasonal dating programs related to certain seasonal product offerings pursuant to which customers that qualify for such programs are offered extended payment terms 
customers generally do not have the right to return product except for rights to return that the company believes are typical of our industry for reasons such as damaged goods  shipping errors or similar occurrences 
with few exceptions  the company is not required to repurchase products from its customers  nor does the company have any regular practice of doing so 
in addition  the company minimizes its exposure to bad debts by evaluating the creditworthiness of its major customers and purchasing credit insurance when appropriate 
bad debt and returns and allowances reserves are recorded as an offset to accounts receivable while reserves for customer programs are recorded as accrued liabilities 
the company evaluates accounts receivable related reserves and accruals monthly by specifically reviewing customer accounts and by reference to historical experience 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is primarily determined by the first in  first out method although certain inventories are valued based on the last in  first out method 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions  customer planograms and sales forecasts 
product development costs product development costs consist of purchases of outside artwork  printing plates  cylinders  catalogs and samples 
the company classifies these costs as a prepaid expense 
product development costs begin to be incurred approximately to months before the holiday event and are amortized monthly over the selling season  generally within two to four months of the respective holiday event 
product development expense is recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization  however  goodwill is subject to an assessment for impairment using a two step fair value based test  the first step of which must be performed at least annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is reported as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense  except at the transition date  when the loss was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in determining the fair value of the reporting units  the company utilizes cash flow models reflecting the expected range of future cash flow outcomes to a prospective buyer over the life of the model 
these cash flows are then discounted to the measurement date using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the development of these cash flow models is based on management estimates and assumptions about future operating results  including revenues and earnings 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax expense state  federal and foreign  including the impact of permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered 
back to contents from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
