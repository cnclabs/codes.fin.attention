to maintain low occupancy costs  we typically concentrate on leasing existing locations that have been operated previously by other retailers 
we actively manage our existing superstores and from time to time close under performing stores 
during fiscal we closed three superstores and during fiscal we closed three superstores 
the terms of our superstore leases vary considerably 
we strive to maintain maximum location flexibility by entering into leases with long initial terms and multiple short term extension options 
we have been able to enter into leases with these terms in part because we generally bear a substantial portion of the cost of preparing the space for a superstore

table of contents we recorded pre tax charges of million in fiscal related to the settlement of shareholder class action lawsuits described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these charges reduced net income by million or approximately per diluted share 
in fiscal  we recorded million in accounting and legal fees associated with the restatement of the first three quarters of fiscal and the prior four fiscal years 
as a result of these fees  fiscal year net losses were increased by million  or per diluted share 
we recorded interest income of approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of interest earned on income tax refunds for amended returns filed for fiscal years through as a result  net income was increased by approximately per diluted share 
the results for fiscal year reflect an income tax benefit of approximately million  or per diluted share  primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance of approximately million previously applied against our deferred tax assets 
based on our past three fiscal years of profitability and our projections of future taxable income  we believe that a valuation allowance is no longer required as of january  as the realization of our deferred tax assets is now considered more likely than not

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
cautionary statements the following cautionary statements and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
expansion strategy 
our growth strategy is dependent principally on our ability to open new superstores and remodel  expand and or relocate certain of our existing superstores and operate them profitably 
in general  the rate of our expansion depends  among other things  on general economic and business conditions affecting consumer confidence and spending  the availability of qualified management personnel and our ability to manage the operational aspects of our growth 
it also depends upon the availability of adequate capital  which in turn depends in a large part upon the cash flow generated from operations 
our future results will depend  among other things  on the success in implementing our expansion strategy 
if stores are opened more slowly than expected  sales at new stores reach targeted levels more slowly than expected or fail to reach targeted levels or related overhead costs increase in excess of expected levels  our ability to successfully implement our expansion strategy would be adversely affected 
seasonality 
as is the case with many retailers  a significant portion of our revenues  and an even greater portion of our operating profit  is generated in the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes the holiday selling season 
as a result  a substantial portion of our annual earnings has been  and will continue to be  dependent on the results of this quarter 
less than satisfactory net sales for such period could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations for the year and may not be sufficient to cover any losses that may have been incurred in the first three quarters of the year 
we experience reduced video rental activity in the spring because customers spend more time outdoors 
major world or sporting events  such as the super bowl  the olympic games or the world series  also have a temporary adverse effect on revenues 
future operating results may be affected by many factors  including variations in the number and timing of superstore openings  the number and popularity of new book  music and video titles  the cost of the new release or best renter titles  changes in comparable store revenues  competition  marketing programs  increases in the minimum wage  weather  special or unusual events  and other factors that may affect our operations 
competition 
we operate in numerous  highly competitive industries including the book  music  sale video and rental video industries 
in each of these products  we compete directly with national superstore operators  as well as regional chains and superstores  specialty retailers dealing in our products  independent single store operators  discount stores  warehouse and mail order clubs  and mass merchandisers 
in addition  the internet is a significant channel for retailing for most of the product categories that we offer 
in particular  the retailing of books  music and video over the internet is highly competitive 
in addition  we face competition from companies engaged in the business of selling books  music and movies and the renting of movies via electronic means  including the downloading of music content and in home video delivery 
an increase in competition in the physical or electronic markets in which we operate could have a material effect on our operations 
consumer spending patterns 
revenues generated from the sale and rental of books  music  videos and other products we carry have historically been dependent upon discretionary consumer spending  which may be affected by general economic conditions  consumer confidence and other factors beyond our control 
a decline in consumer spending on the buying and or rental of the products we offer could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to fund our expansion strategy 

table of contents reliance on key personnel 
management believes that the company s continued success will depend  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of mr 
john h 
marmaduke  chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of mr 
marmaduke could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we maintain key man life insurance on mr 
marmaduke 
in addition  our success depends  in part  on our ability to retain key management and attract other personnel to satisfy our current and future needs 
the inability to retain key management personnel or attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
home video retailer distribution window 
a competitive advantage that home video retailers currently enjoy over most other movie distribution channels  except theatrical release  is the early timing of the home video retailer distribution window 
after the initial theatrical release of a movie  studios generally make their movies available to home video retailers for rental and retail  including by mass merchant retailers for specified periods of time 
this distribution window is typically exclusive against most other forms of non theatrical movie distribution  such as pay per view  video on demand  premium television  basic cable and network and syndicated television 
the length of this exclusive distribution window for home video retailers varies  but has traditionally ranged from to days for domestic video stores 
thereafter  movies are made sequentially available to television distribution channels 
our business could be negatively affected if i video retailer distribution windows were no longer the first following the theatrical release  ii the length of the home video retailer distribution windows were shortened  or iii the home video retailer distribution windows were no longer as exclusive as they are now because newly released movies would be made available earlier on these other forms of non theatrical movie distribution 
as a result  consumers would no longer need to wait until after the home video retailer distribution window to view a newly released movie on these other distribution channels 
we believe that the studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable home video retail industry 
however  the order  length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the movie  and we cannot predict future decisions by the studios  or the impact  if any  of those decisions 
in addition  any consolidation or vertical integration of media companies to include both content providers and digital distributors could pose a risk to the continuation of the distribution window 
current rental video studio pricing policies 
recent studio pricing for movies released to home video retailers has impacted our video business 
historically  studio pricing was based on whether or not a studio desired to promote a movie for both rental and sale to the consumer  or primarily for rental  from the beginning of the home video distribution window 
in order to promote a movie title for rental  the title would be released to home video retailers at a price that was too high to allow for an affordable sales price by the retailer to the consumer at the beginning of the retail home video distribution window 
as rental demand subsided  the studio would reduce pricing in order to then allow for reasonably priced sales to consumers 
currently  substantially all dvd titles are released at a price to the home video retailer that is low enough to allow for an affordable sales price by the retailer to the consumer from the beginning of the retail home video distribution window 
this sell through pricing policy has led to increasing competition from other retailers  including mass merchants such as wal mart and online retailers  who are able  due to the lower sell through prices  to purchase dvds for sale to consumers at the same time as traditional home video retailers  like hastings  purchase both dvds and vhs product for rental 
in addition  some retailers sell movies at lower prices in order to increase overall traffic to their stores or businesses  and mass merchants may be more willing to sell at lower prices  and in some instances  below wholesale 
these factors have increased consumer interest in purchasing dvds  which has reduced the significance of the vhs rental window 
we believe that the increased consumer purchases are due in part to consumer interest in building dvd libraries of classic movies and personal favorites and that the studios will remain dependent on the traditional home video retailer to generate revenues for the studios from titles that are not classics or current box office hits 
we therefore believe the importance of the video rental industry to the studios will continue to be a factor in studio pricing decisions 
however  we cannot control or predict studio pricing policies with certainty  and we cannot assure you that consumers will not  as a result of further decreases in studio sell through pricing and or sustained or further depressed pricing by competitors  increasingly desire to purchase rather than rent movies 
personal dvd libraries could also cause 
table of contents consumers to rent or purchase fewer movies in the future 
our profitability could therefore be negatively affected if  in light of any such consumer behavior  we were unable to i grow our rental business  ii replace gross profits from generally higher margin rentals with gross profits from increased sales of generally lower margin sell through product  or iii otherwise positively affect gross profits  such as through price increases or cost reductions 
our ability to achieve one or more of these objectives is subject to risks  including the risk that we may not be able to compete effectively with other dvd retailers  some of whom may have competitive advantages such as the pricing flexibility described above or favorable consumer perceptions regarding value 
regardless of the wholesale pricing environment  the extent of our profitability is dependent on our ability to enter into arrangements with the studios that effectively balance copy depth and cost considerations 
each type of arrangement provides different advantages and challenges for us 
the ability to negotiate preferred terms under revenue sharing agreements for the procurement of dvd  video games and vhs titles is crucial to our operations 
our profitability could be negatively affected if studios were to make other changes in their wholesale pricing policies and revenue sharing agreements 
alternate methods of video delivery 
advances in technologies such as video on demand or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery  could have a negative effect on our business 
in particular  our business could be impacted if i newly released movies were to be made widely available by the studios to these technologies at the same time or before they are made available to home video retailers for rental  and ii these technologies were to be widely accepted by consumers 
in addition  advances in direct broadcast satellite and cable technologies may adversely affect public demand for video store rentals 
if direct broadcast satellite and digital cable were to become more widely available and accepted  this could cause a smaller number of movies to be rented if viewers were to favor the expanded number of conventional channels and expanded content  including movies  specialty programming and sporting events  offered through these services 
if this were to occur  it could have a negative effect on our video store business 
direct broadcast satellite providers transmit numerous channels of programs by satellite transmission into subscribers homes 
also  cable providers are taking advantage of digital technology to transmit many additional channels of television programs over cable lines to subscribers homes 
amortization and salvage value of rental video 
certain events mentioned in this annual report on form k and others  including a downturn in the rental video industry as a whole or in the markets within which we operate our superstores  further consolidation of rental video retailers  a substantial change in customer demand and a change in the mix of rental video revenues  could affect the salvage value we have assigned to our rental video assets 
the effect could result in a material reduction of the carrying value of our rental video assets and have a material impact on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in particular  the growth of the dvd market and the shift of consumer purchases from vhs videocassettes to dvd could result in a decrease in the salvage value of rental videos 
at some point during the rental cycle  a vhs item  as with dvd and games  is available for purchase by a customer as a previously viewed tape pvt 
with the shift in consumer interest from vhs to dvd  we have experienced a significant reduction in the revenues generated by vhs  see fiscal compared to fiscal in this section 
in order to reduce exposure to a declining product category  we monitor closely the recovery value received as well as the on hand levels of our pvt 
in addition  we are implementing an electronic pull criteria that will better identify when a tape should be made available as pvt in order to maximize recovery value 
our current experience is that the amount received for a previously viewed tape is higher than our estimated salvage value of that item in our rental inventory 
based in part on this factor and sales of previously viewed tapes  we believe our estimate of salvage value is appropriate  however  if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than management projections  inventory adjustments  including possible changes to rental video asset cost amortization methods or salvage values  may be required 

table of contents overview hastings entertainment is a leading multimedia entertainment retailer that sells and rents various home entertainment products  including books  music  software  periodicals  new and used cds  dvds  video games and videocassettes  video game consoles and dvd players through its entertainment superstores and its internet web site 
as of january   we operated superstores averaging approximately  square feet in small to medium sized markets located in states  primarily in the western and midwestern united states 
each of the superstores is wholly owned by us and operates under the name of hastings 
during  the music industry continued to decline  although at a lesser rate than in prior years  and the rental market slowed  particularly in the latter half of the year  to some extent as a result of higher video sales 
despite these industry influences  we reported revenue increases for fiscal due primarily to the broad selection of products in our superstores 
in addition  we accomplished several goals during including i a reduction in the cost of returning merchandise inventory to vendors through management  systems and controls improvements  ii higher gross profit on revenues driven by improved inventory procurement and continued negotiation of improved video rental revenue sharing contract terms  iii a more efficient and balanced merchandise inventory  and iv significantly reduced debt levels as of january  we believe that these improvements will have an effect on future periods 
our operating strategy is to enhance our position as a multimedia entertainment retailer by expanding and remodeling existing superstores  opening new superstores in selected markets  and offering our products through our internet web site 
references herein to fiscal years are to the twelve month periods that end in january of the following calendar year 
for example  the twelve month period ended january  is referred to as fiscal critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant estimates and assumptions are reviewed  and any required adjustments are recorded  on a monthly basis 
lower of cost or market for merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
as with any retailer  economic conditions  cyclical customer demand and changes in purchasing or distribution can affect the carrying value of inventory 
as circumstances warrant  we record lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
in some instances  these adjustments can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in order to determine such adjustments  we evaluate the age  inventory turns and estimated fair value of merchandise inventory by product category and record an adjustment if estimated market value is below cost 
through merchandising and an automated progressive markdown program  we quickly take the steps necessary to increase the sell off of slower moving merchandise to eliminate or lessen the effect of these adjustments 
returns process 
merchandise inventory owned by us is generally returnable based upon return agreements with our merchandise vendors 
we continually return merchandise to vendors based on  among other factors  current and projected sales trends  overstock situations  authorized return timelines or changes in product offerings 
at the end of any reporting period  cost accruals are required for inventory that has been returned to vendors  is in the process of being returned to vendors  or has been identified to be returned to vendors 
these costs can include freight  valuation and quantity differences  and other fees charged by a vendor 
in order to appropriately match the costs associated with the return of merchandise with the process of returning such merchandise  we utilize an allowance for cost of inventory returns 
to accrue for such costs and estimate this allowance  we utilize historical experience adjusted for significant estimated or contractual modifications 
certain adjustments to the allowance can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 

table of contents rental video asset cost amortization 
we have a series of direct revenue sharing agreements with major studios and we anticipate that our future involvement in revenue sharing agreements will be similar to that of fiscal year revenue sharing allows us to acquire rental video assets at a lower up front capital cost than traditional buying arrangements 
we then share with studios a percentage of the actual net rental revenues generated over a contractually determined period of time 
the increased access to additional copies of new releases under revenue sharing agreements allows customer demand for new releases to be satisfied over the shorter period of time when the new releases are most popular 
under the terms of the specific contracts with supplying studios  we expense revenue sharing payments through rental video cost of revenue  as revenues are recognized 
the capitalized cost of all rental video assets acquired for a fixed price is being amortized on an accelerated basis over six months to a salvage value of per unit  except for rental video assets purchased for the initial stock of a new superstore  which are being amortized on a straight line basis over months to a salvage value of rental video assets purchased for less than are not amortized 
we monitor closely the recovery value of our rental video assets and are implementing an electronic pull criteria in order to maximize recovery value 
our current experience is that the recovery value of our rental video assets is higher than our estimated salvage value of that item in our rental inventory 
based in part on this factor and sales of previously viewed tapes  we believe our estimate of salvage value is appropriate 
however  if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than management projections  inventory adjustments  including possible changes to rental video asset cost amortization methods or salvage values  may be required 
store closing reserve 
on a quarterly basis  and in the normal course of business  we evaluate our store base to determine if we need to close or relocate a store s 
management will evaluate  among other factors  current and future profitability  market trends  age of store and lease status 
the primary expense items associated with the closure of a store relate to the net present value of minimum lease payments the present value of remaining lease payments under an active lease and the write off of leasehold improvements and other assets not remaining in our possession 
prior to december   such expense items were recorded as of the date that management made the decision to close or relocate a store and sublease income was not recorded as part of the estimate until a contract with a sublet tenant had been signed 
subsequent to december   and in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 we now recognize such expense items at the time the location is closed or relocated 
the amount recorded can fluctuate based on the age of the closing location  term and remaining years of the lease and the number of stores being closed or relocated 
we actively pursue sublease tenants on all closed or relocated locations and  as part of the final estimation of store closing liability  the impact of any sublease income is estimated 
the net of the described charges and sublease income estimates can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenue primarily from retail sales and rental of our products 
merchandise and rental revenues are recognized at the point of sale or rental or at the time merchandise is shipped to the customer 
revenues are presented net of estimated returns and exclude all taxes 
customers may return certain merchandise for exchange or refund within our policies  and an allowance has been established to provide for projected returns 
there are no provisions for uncollectible amounts since payment is received at the time of sale 
we  as with most retailers  also offer gift cards for sale 
deferred revenue  a current liability  is recognized at the time a gift card is sold with the costs of designing  printing and distributing the cards recorded as an expense as incurred 
the deferred revenue liability is relieved and revenue is recognized upon the redemption of the gift cards 
from time to time we will offer sales incentives to customers  in the form of rebates 
revenue is reduced by the amount of estimated redemptions  based on experience of similar types of rebate offers  and a deferred revenue liability is established 
the deferred revenue liability is relieved when the customer has completed all criteria necessary to file a valid rebate claim 
any remaining portion of deferred revenue is recorded as revenue following the termination of the extended redemption period and following completion of all outstanding rebate claims 
comparable store revenue 
stores included in the comparable store revenues calculation are those stores that have been open for a minimum of weeks 
also included are stores that are remodeled or relocated 
sales via the internet are not included and closed stores are removed from each comparable period for the purpose of calculating comparable store revenues 

table of contents vendor allowances 
in  the emerging issues task force eitf discussed issue no 
eitf  which addresses the accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor by a reseller for various vendor funded allowances  including cooperative advertising support 
the eitf determined that cash consideration received from a vendor should be presumed to be a reduction of the prices of vendor s products and  therefore  should be shown as a reduction in the cost of goods sold when recognized in the reseller s income statements 
the only exception to this rule is if the reimbursement is for specific  incremental identifiable costs 
if the amount of cash consideration received exceeds the cost being reimbursed  that excess amount should be characterized as a reduction of cost of goods sold when recognized in the reseller s income statements

other than our principal capital requirements arising from the purchase  warehousing and merchandising of inventory and rental videos  opening new superstores and expanding existing superstores and updating existing and implementing new information systems technology  we have no anticipated material capital commitments 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operating activities  trade credit from vendors and borrowings under our amended revolving credit facility 
we believe our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our amended revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations  new superstores and superstore expansions through fiscal historically we have experienced an increase in our debt level during the third quarter of our fiscal year 
for third quarter of fiscal  we are projecting our debt level to increase to approximately million to million 
however  we expect this balance to reduce to approximately million to million due to a higher level of repayments during the fourth quarter following the holiday selling season 
consolidated cash flows operating activities 
net cash flows from operating activities increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in addition to an increase in net income of approximately million  decreases in inventory balances were approximately million higher during fiscal when compared to fiscal primarily due to more balanced merchandise inventories  which required a lesser buildup  entering the holiday selling season

these agreements include minimum purchase requirements  based upon the box office results of the title  at a lower initial product cost as compared to non revenue sharing purchases 
in addition  these contracts require net rental revenues to be shared with the studios over an agreed period of time 
we have included amounts owed and an estimate of our contractual obligation under these agreements for performance guarantees and minimum purchase requirements for the period in which they can reasonably be estimated  which is approximately two months in the future 
although these contracts may extend beyond the estimated two month period  we cannot reasonably estimate these amounts due to the uncertainty of purchases that will be made under these agreements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of variable rate debt based on the lenders base rate or libor plus a specified percentage at our option
