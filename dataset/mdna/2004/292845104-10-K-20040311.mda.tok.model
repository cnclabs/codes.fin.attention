 earnings per share 
for a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies  see page results of operations net sales were billion in  compared with billion in and billion in net earnings were million per share in  compared with million per share in and million per share in net earnings in include a royalty settlement gain of million  a charge of million for the fair value of the remaining lease costs of certain minerals storage facilities that the company ceased to use because of productivity initiatives and restructuring charges of million 
in addition  a transition charge of million was recorded on january  as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
net earnings in include an impairment charge of million associated with the engelhard clal joint venture  an impairment charge of million associated with an investment in fuel cell developer plug power inc  a charge of million related to a manufacturing consolidation plan and a million insurance settlement gain 
the information in the discussion of each segment s results discussed below is derived directly from the internal financial reporting system used for management purposes 
items allocated to each segment s results include the majority of corporate operating charges 
unallocated items include interest expense  interest income  royalty income  sale of precious metals accounted for under the last in  first out lifo method  certain special charges and credits  income taxes  certain information technology development costs and other miscellaneous corporate items 
operating earnings in the company s all other category increased primarily from the royalty settlement gain of million million after tax reported in see note  special charges and credits  for further detail 
environmental technologies the environmental technologies segment markets cost effective compliance with environmental regulations  enabled by sophisticated emission control technologies and systems 
the segment also provides high value material products made principally from platinum group metals  as well as thermal spray and coating technologies 
performance sales increased to million and operating earnings increased to million 
discussion the majority of this segment s sales and operating earnings are derived from technologies to control pollution from mobile sources  including gasoline and diesel powered passenger cars  sport utility vehicles  trucks  buses and off road vehicles 
sales increased primarily from the addition of higher pass through substrate costs and the favorable impact of foreign exchange  which collectively accounted for approximately two thirds of the sales increase 
sales were also favorably impacted from increased sales of advanced technology solutions to the automotive markets 
in addition  higher volumes and a favorable product mix in both diesel oem and retrofit markets had a favorable impact on sales 
higher sales were partially offset by million on lower volumes of emission control systems for gas turbines used in power generation applications and by million on lower volumes to surface coating markets primarily due to lower demand from the aerospace industry 
operating earnings were higher from increased sales of advanced technology solutions to the automotive markets 
operating earnings were also favorably impacted due to increased volumes and a favorable product mix in both diesel oem and retrofit markets  the absence of costs in the year ago period related to rework for power generation applications of million  the favorable impact of foreign exchange of million  and a manufacturing consolidation charge of million recorded in the second quarter of the increase was partially offset by lower volumes of emission control systems for gas turbines used in power generation applications and lower volumes to surface coating markets 
this decline resulted from a strong year ago first quarter in the energy market and lower demand from the aerospace industry 
earnings also decreased due to a management consolidation and productivity initiative that resulted in a charge of million recorded in the first quarter of  the reversal of a warranty accrual of million in the first quarter of for a particular stationary source  emission control capital equipment project as a result of improved technology  the recognition of expenses of million due to customer related financial issues  higher depreciation costs of million and higher energy costs of million 
outlook this segment expects growth in sales and operating earnings as emission control regulations become stricter around the world and address a much broader range of emission sources 
demand from the automotive market is expected to remain strong in response to the company s development of several new technologies 
although auto builds in our largest market segments are forecasted to be flat in  ongoing productivity improvements and increased demand in asia are expected to support modest growth in this portion of the segment 
a significant decline in auto builds could have an unfavorable effect on this segment  depending on the demand for platforms where the segment provides catalysts 
in stationary source markets  demand is expected to remain soft for technologies related to peak power generation due to the current lack of funding for these projects 
sales of advanced catalysts for medium and heavy duty diesel trucks increased in and are expected to expand in as new regulations begin to take effect 
significant investment in research for medium and heavy duty diesel continues in anticipation of more stringent regulations scheduled to begin phasing in during and this segment continues to work to reduce its reliance on the automotive market by developing an array of applications not only for medium and heavy duty diesel markets  but also for non automotive markets  including technologies for motorcycles  small engines  such as lawn and garden power equipment  charbroilers  mining and construction  and ozone management 
compared with sales increased to million and operating earnings decreased to million 
discussion sales increased primarily from the addition of higher pass through substrate costs of million  an estimated increase in worldwide production of light duty vehicles and higher volumes in both diesel oem and retrofit markets 
higher sales were reduced by million on lower volumes of emission control systems for gas turbines used in power generation applications and by million on lower volumes to surface coating markets 
operating earnings decreased primarily from higher expenses of million associated with rework for power generation applications  higher depreciation  depletion and amortization costs of million  a manufacturing consolidation charge of million recorded in and higher research and development costs of million 
process technologies the process technologies segment enables customers to make their processes more productive  efficient  environmentally sound and safer through the supply of advanced chemical process catalysts  additives and sorbents 
performance sales increased to million and operating earnings increased to million 
discussion sales grew primarily from increased demand for new technologies offered to the petroleum refining dms platform products and additives  polyolefin lynx platform and gas to liquids markets which aggregated million and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of million 
sales were reduced by million due to lower precious metal prices  which are passed through to chemical process catalyst customers in europe and lower sales to chemical process markets of million primarily from the timing of orders and related shipments 
operating earnings rose primarily due to increased demand for new technologies offered to the petroleum refining  polyolefin and gas to liquids markets  lower raw material costs of million excluding nickel  the favorable impact of foreign exchange of million  and benefits from productivity programs 
these increases were partially offset by a productivity initiative that resulted in a charge of million recorded in the first quarter of  higher energy costs of million and higher nickel costs of million 
outlook sales and earnings growth in this segment are expected to come from custom process catalysts  such as those that enable conversion of gas to liquids  new catalyst and additive technologies for petroleum refining  and increased market penetration for polypropylene catalysts 
continued cost management  productivity improvements and product technology advances should also contribute to earnings growth 
capacity expansion of a polyolefin catalyst plant in tarragona  spain is expected to come online in the first half of overall weakness in the chemical process market and relatively flat demand in the petroleum refining market are expected to continue for most of compared with sales decreased to million and operating earnings decreased to million 
discussion sales and operating earnings were lower in primarily from lower volumes to the chemical process and petroleum refining markets 
these decreases were partially offset by increased demand for lynx polypropylene catalysts  naphthamax refining catalysts and petroleum refining additives  which aggregated million  the full year inclusion of a fats and oils catalyst business acquired from sud chemie in october  and the introduction of a new gas to liquids catalyst in sales were also reduced by million due to lower precious metal prices  which are passed through to chemical process catalyst customers in europe 
operating earnings were favorably impacted by lower energy and raw material costs of million  the elimination of goodwill amortization of million related to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  full year inclusion of million of results from the fats and oils catalyst business acquired from sud chemie in october  and favorable impact of foreign exchange of million 
appearance and performance technologies the appearance and performance technologies segment provides pigments  effect materials and performance additives that enable its customers to market enhanced image and functionality in their products 
this segment serves a broad array of end markets  including coatings  plastics  cosmetics  automotive  construction and paper 
the segment s products help customers improve the look  performance and overall cost of their products 
in addition  the segment is the internal supply source of precursors for most of the company s advanced petroleum refining catalysts 
performance sales increased to million and operating earnings decreased to million 
discussion sales increased slightly in as significant sales volumes to the coatings  cosmetics  personal care and automotive markets  and the net favorable impact of foreign exchange of million were partially offset by lower volumes of mineral based products to the paper and industrial end markets 
lower volumes of mineral based products were attributed to continued weak demand in the paper market and the loss of some volume to competition due to pricing 
operating earnings were lower primarily from a charge of million recorded in the second quarter of for the fair value of the remaining lease costs of certain minerals storage facilities that the company ceased to use because of productivity initiatives  lower minerals sales volumes to the paper market  higher energy costs of million and higher costs related to the start up of a new manufacturing plant in china 
this decrease was partially offset by continued strong growth in the colorant and effect pigment markets 
outlook earnings growth within this segment is expected to improve from the weak and mixed results reported in sales and earnings to several major markets  including coatings  cosmetics  personal care  automotive and agriculture  are expected to continue its pattern of growth 
this growth is expected to be driven by expansion of the segment s technology base through alliances and internal development  which should result in new products  applications and served markets 
earnings growth from mineral based markets is expected to improve in spite of a continued weak paper industry outlook through most of the coming year 
this growth is expected to come from productivity improvements and sales increases to non paper markets 
however  worldwide coated paper consumption has been relatively flat over the period to and down from the peaks reached in while modest growth is expected over the next several years  the hydrous kaolin market continues to be particularly difficult 
brazilian producers have brought more than million tons of capacity on stream since this has exacerbated an over capacity situation and led to severe price competition  particularly as consolidations have given paper producers greater purchasing power 
as a consequence of trying to maintain pricing and capture energy surcharges  engelhard has lost market share  which will reduce volumes 
however  to increase earnings in spite of these conditions  there will be a continued emphasis on productivity and efforts to focus on higher value end markets  including non paper applications 
a series of actions were initiated in the first quarter of to reduce costs by consolidating plant operations and reducing total headcount 
recent calculations show no impairment of long lived assets  but continued volume and or price erosion could change the situation 
compared with sales increased to million and operating earnings increased to million 
discussion sales and operating earnings were up primarily from increased sales volumes to the coatings  automotive  agricultural  cosmetics  personal care and plastics markets 
operating earnings were also favorably impacted by lower costs from productivity improvements of million  the elimination of goodwill amortization of million related to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  lower energy costs of million  the recording of a million charge in relating to asset redeployment actions and productivity initiatives  and selective price increases in the paper market in the range of to 
materials services the materials services segment serves the company s technology segments  their customers and others with precious and base metals and related services 
this is a distribution and materials services business that purchases and sells precious metals  base metals and related products and services 
it does so under a variety of pricing and delivery arrangements structured to meet the logistical  financial and price risk management requirements of the company  its customers and suppliers 
additionally  it offers the related services of precious metal refining and storage  and produces precious metal salts and solutions 
performance sales decreased to billion and operating earnings decreased to million 
discussion sales for this segment include substantially all of the company s sales of metals to industrial customers of all segments 
sales also include fees invoiced for services rendered eg  refining and handling charges 
because of the logistical and hedging nature of much of this business and the significant precious metal values included in both sales and cost of sales  gross margins tend to be low in relation to the company s other technology businesses as does capital employed 
this effect also dampens the gross margin percentages of the company as a whole  but improves the return on investment 
while many customers for the company s platinum group metal catalysts purchase the metal from materials services  some choose to deliver metal from other sources prior to the manufacture of the catalysts 
in such cases  precious metal values are not included in sales 
the mix of such arrangements and the extent of market price fluctuations can significantly affect the reported level of sales and cost of sales 
consequently  there is no necessary direct correlation between year to year changes in reported sales and operating earnings 
operating earnings were lower primarily from the timing of certain items discussed below  changes in pricing formulas that reduce margins and lower results from the recycling refining of platinum group metals of million 
recycling earnings were down primarily from higher costs associated with performance issues at a domestic refinery and a less favorable mix of metals 
the performance issues  which are apart from the current level of operations  are being actively addressed by management 
operating earnings in both years were favorably affected by several items that triggered recognition of events reflecting operations from prior periods 
operating earnings in benefited from a contract settlement of million and the reversal of an accrual that is no longer necessary of million 
in  operating earnings were favorably affected by million of income related to platinum group metal transactions realized previously but deferred pending the resolution of certain contractual provisions  an insurance settlement gain of million  million of income related to a previously unrecognized contractual benefit and million of income related to cash received from the settlement of litigation for a customer receivable recorded in that was previously written off 
the prior year benefits were partially offset by higher operating expenses from multiple causes  including legal and compensation expenses 
sales decreased from lower platinum group metal prices and lower volumes 
outlook the results of this segment are likely to approximate recent levels rather than the higher levels of overall weakness projected in the chemical markets should continue to adversely impact the recycling and refining of platinum group metals 
in addition  the segment is continuing to experience the change that has been going on in these markets  which involves different pricing formulas that have reduced historical margins 
compared with sales decreased to billion and operating earnings decreased to million 
discussion operating earnings were down as a result of lower volumes and lower results from the recycling refining of platinum group metals of million 
operating earnings in both years were favorably affected by several items that triggered recognition of events reflecting operations from prior periods 
in  operating earnings were favorably affected by million of income related to platinum group metal transactions realized previously but deferred pending the resolution of certain contractual provisions  an insurance settlement gain of million  million of income related to a previously unrecognized contractual benefit  and million of income related to cash received from the settlement of litigation for a customer receivable recorded in that was previously written off 
in  operating earnings were favorably impacted by the recovery of metal from an unexpected industrial customer bankruptcy million and the restructuring of a professional services contract million

sales from the materials services segment decreased in to billion and provided a gross profit of  while sales from all other reportable segments increased to billion and provided a gross profit of 
as described earlier  the lower margins on materials services sales are driven by the inclusion of the value of precious metals in both sales and cost of sales 
the overall increase in was primarily related to a billion decrease in sales from lower precious metal prices 
selling  administrative and other expenses selling  administrative and other expenses were million in compared with million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to increased professional and legal fees of million  increased research and development expenses of million and increased information technology expenses of million 
the increase in was primarily due to increased information technology expenses of million  increased research and development expenses of million  increased administrative rent expenses of million and increased professional fees of million 
equity earnings equity in earnings of affiliates was million in  compared with equity earnings of million in excluding the impairment charge discussed below and million in the increase was primarily due to higher earnings from engelhard clal recognized in liquidation resulting from the sale of platinum inventories at favorable prices  realized gains on the sale of an inactive facility and the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar  all in relation to projections made at the time of the impairment 
the decrease in was from gains reported in related to a change in the mix of platinum group metals used in its operations and lower volumes due to the absence of divested business units 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of million associated with its engelhard clal joint venture see note  investments  for further detail 
loss on investment in the second quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of million million after tax associated with its plug power inc investment see note  investments  for further detail 
interest interest expense was million in  compared with million in and million in interest expense in decreased due to decreased borrowings  partially offset by higher foreign short term interest rates 
interest expense in decreased from decreased borrowings and lower short term interest rates 
interest income was million in  million in and million in the company capitalized interest of million in each of  and taxes the worldwide income tax expense was million in  compared with million in and million in the effective income tax rate was in  in excluding the equity investment impairment charge of million and in the decrease in the worldwide effective tax rate in was primarily the result of the recognition of favorable tax variances from foreign tax credits  partially offset by a shift in the geographical mix of earnings 
the decrease in the worldwide effective tax rate in was primarily the result of higher percentage depletion deductions and research and development tax credits in excess of previous estimates see note  income taxes  for further detail of variances 
the world trade organization has ruled that the extraterritorial income eti exclusion  which provides the company with a tax benefit based on export sales  is a prohibited export subsidy 
as a result  eti rules are presently under reconsideration by congress and the repeal of this benefit is likely 
in fiscal year  export benefits reduced the company s effective tax rate by approximately three percentage points 
it is not possible to predict at this time the eventual outcome of this matter and the impact to the company 
however  if eti is repealed and legislation that would result in comparable benefits is not enacted  the loss of the tax benefit to the company will adversely impact the company s effective tax rate and net income 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at december   compared with million at december  the current ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
the year end market value of the company s precious metals  accounted for under the lifo method  exceeded carrying cost by million at december   compared with million at december  the decrease in excess value reflects lower market values and the impact of slightly reduced inventory levels see note  inventories  for further detail 
the company s total debt decreased to million at december  from million at december  the percentage of total debt to total capitalization decreased to at december  from at december   primarily due to decreased borrowings and increased retained earnings 
the company currently has a million  five year committed credit facility that expires in may and a million  day committed credit facility that expires in may  with a group of major us and overseas banks 
the company intends to renew  and possibly increase  the million committed line of credit that expires in may in addition  the company has a million  seven year committed credit facility with two major foreign banks that expires in october relating to a plant expansion in china 
unused  uncommitted lines of credit were million at december  through a public debt offering in may  the company issued million of year notes 
these notes mature on may  and bear an interest rate of 
the proceeds were used to repay short term borrowings 
as discussed in note  derivative instruments and hedging  these notes were effectively changed from a fixed rate debt obligation to a floating rate debt obligation through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
the notes were issued under the company s existing million shelf registration  effectively reducing the available shelf registration to million 
plans to increase the shelf registration up to million are under consideration by management 
plans to issue million to million in japanese yen denominated notes are also under consideration by management 
operating activities provided net cash of million in  compared with million in and million in the variance in cash flows from operating activities primarily occurred in the materials services segment and reflects changes in metal positions used to facilitate requirements of the company  its metal customers and suppliers see note  supplemental information  for materials services variances 
due to changing customer supplier relationships with respect to platinum group metals  the levels of committed metal positions and hedged metal obligations have been reduced by approximately half from those of the last several years 
current levels are expected to prevail for at least the next year 
materials services routinely enters into a variety of arrangements for the sourcing of metals 
generally  transactions are hedged on a daily basis see note  summary of significant accounting policies  for further detail 
hedging is accomplished primarily through forward  future and option contracts 
however  in closely monitored situations for which exposure levels have been set by senior management  the company  from time to time  holds large unhedged industrial commodity positions that are subject to future market price fluctuations 
these positions are included in committed metal positions  along with hedged metal holdings 
the bulk of hedged metal obligations represent spot short positions 
as these positions generate cash  their cash effect is included in the financing activities section of the company s consolidated statements of cash flows 
other than in closely monitored situations  these positions are hedged with forward purchases 
in addition  the aggregate fair value of derivatives in a loss position are reported in hedged metal obligations derivatives in a gain position are included in committed metal positions 
materials services works to ensure that the company and its customers have an uninterrupted source of metals  primarily platinum group metals  utilizing supply contracts and commodities markets around the world 
committed metal positions may include significant advances made for the purchase of precious metals that have been delivered to the company but for which the final purchase price has not yet been determined 
as of december   the aggregate market value of the metals purchased under a contract for which a provisional price had been paid was in excess of the amounts advanced by a total of million 
as a result  this amount was recorded in committed metal positions and accounts payable at december  the variance in cash flows from investing activities is primarily related to liquidating distributions received in connection with the plan to unwind the company s engelhard clal joint venture  the acquisition of certain operating assets of shuozhou anpeak kaolin co  ltd 
in november  an additional non equity investment in fuel cell developer plug power inc in and the acquisition of the fats and oils catalyst business of sud chemie in october the variance in cash flows from financing activities was impacted by a change in hedged metal obligations as discussed above  proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt in may  a decrease in short term borrowings  the repayment of long term debt in and cash received from the exercise of stock options  particularly in the following table is a representation of the company s contractual obligations as of december  the notes below provide further detail with regard to the company s purchase obligations payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions short term borrowings accounts payable other current liabilities hedged metal obligations long term debt operating leases purchase obligations metal supply contracts a other purchase obligations b other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap c total contractual obligations a these amounts reflect minimum purchase obligations for the purchase of platinum group metals assuming the december  prices for the various metals continue into the specified future periods 
however  these are not fixed price arrangements  the prices are based on future market prices 
as a result  the company will be able to hedge the purchases with sales at those future prices 
b amounts primarily relate to purchase orders for raw material purchases and warehousing and transportation related costs 
c amounts primarily relate to postretirement postemployment obligations see note  benefits  for further detail  with the remainder consisting of executive deferred compensation  sfas no 
asset retirement obligations see note  accounting for asset retirement obligations  for further detail and the long term portion of the environmental reserve see note  environmental costs  for further detail 
in the normal course of business  the company incurs obligations with regard to contract completion and product performance 
under certain circumstances  these obligations are supported through the issuance of letters of credit 
at december   the aggregate outstanding amount of letters of credit supporting such obligations amounted to million  of which million will expire in less than one year  million will expire in two to three years and million will expire after five years 
in the opinion of management  such obligations will not significantly affect the company s financial position or results of operations as the company anticipates fulfilling its performance obligations 
at december   the company did not have any guarantees of any unconsolidated subsidiary or third party obligations 
the company has consistently derived considerable cash flow from operations  which has been used  along with both short and long term debt  to pay for capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and other corporate requirements 
the continuation of these levels of cash flow is expected  but is subject to the risk factors listed elsewhere in this report particularly in the forward looking statements section on page 
in addition  the company has always maintained investment grade credit ratings that it considers important for cost effective and ready access to the credit markets 
management fully expects to be able to obtain future funding from both short and long term debt for cash requirements in excess of cash flow from operations 
in the event that any of these sources prove to be below expectations  the company has access to committed lines of credit aggregating million as of december  management intends to renew  and possibly increase  the million committed line of credit that expires in may credit risk the company believes that its financial instruments do not represent a concentration of credit risk because the company deals with a variety of major banks worldwide and its accounts receivable are spread among a number of major industries  customers and geographic areas 
a centralized credit committee reviews significant credit transactions and risk management issues before granting of credit  and an appropriate level of reserves is maintained 
in addition  the company monitors the status of accounts receivable and the financial condition of its customers to help ensure collections and to minimize losses 
the company may enter into transactions in which it advances funds after receipt of metal as provisional payment for the metal which is to be finally priced under market based pricing formulae that will result in a determination of that price 
if the final price is less than the provisional price paid  the supplier will be obligated to return the difference to the company 
therefore  if the market price and the anticipated final price falls below the provisional price  the company is exposed to the potential credit risk associated with the possibility of non payment by the supplier  although no payment is due until after the final price is determined 
as of december   the aggregate market value of metals purchased under a contract for which a provisional price had been paid was in excess of the amounts advanced by a total of million 
as a result  this amount was recorded in committed metal positions and accounts payable at december  and no current credit risk exists 
capital expenditures  commitments and contingencies capital projects are designed to maintain capacity  expand operations  improve efficiency or protect the environment 
capital expenditures amounted to million in  million in and million in capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million

critical accounting policies certain key policies are explained below to assist in understanding the company s consolidated financial statements 
more detailed explanations may be found elsewhere in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a section and in note  summary of significant accounting policies 
sales a significant portion of consolidated net sales represent the sale of platinum group metals to industrial customers who buy the metals from materials services in connection with products manufactured by the environmental and process technologies segments 
accordingly  almost all of these sales are reported in the materials services segment  with a limited amount included in environmental and process technologies reported sales 
because metal price levels may vary widely  there is no consistent relationship between consolidated sales and gross profit 
because the timing of the purchase of spot metals often does not coincide with the timing of the subsequent sales to industrial users  materials services needs to hedge price risk  usually by selling forward ie  for future delivery to investment grade trading entities  industrial companies or on futures exchanges 
if a surplus of physical metal develops  materials services may also sell spot and buy forward to balance the risk position 
other than hedges entered into with industrial customers  sales related to these hedging transactions are not included in reported sales  as they are not meaningful in an industrial context 
customers of the environmental and process technologies segments who purchase products that improve efficiency and yields are often unable to precisely predict the dates that catalysts will be required 
accordingly  they may request that product that has already been ordered  manufactured and prepared for shipment at the agreed upon date be temporarily held by the company until that customer s manufacturing facility is prepared to accept the new charge of catalyst 
in cases where the customer requests the company to hold the goods  agrees to be invoiced and to pay the invoices on normal terms  as well as to accept title to the goods  the company will recognize the sale prior to shipment 
great care is exercised to make sure that these sales are only recognized in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
mark to market materials services procures physical metal from third parties for resale and enters into forward contracts and other relatively straight forward hedging derivatives that are recorded as either assets or liabilities at their fair value 
by acting in its capacity as a distributor and materials service provider to the company s technology businesses and their customers and by taking closely monitored unhedged positions as described below  materials services takes on the attributes of a dealer in metals 
both spot metal and derivative instruments used in hedging ie  forwards  futures  swaps and options are stated at fair value 
the company values platinum  palladium  gold and silver based on the daily closing new york mercantile exchange nymex settlement prices 
there are no so called terminal markets for rhodium  ruthenium and iridium  so the company s own published industrial bullion eib prices are used 
however  these are compared to other reference prices published in metals week  an independent trade journal 
values for base metals come from the closing prices of the london metals exchange lme 
in closely monitored situations  for which exposure levels and transaction size limits have been set by senior management  the company holds unhedged metal positions that are subject to future market fluctuations 
such positions may include varying levels of derivative instruments 
at times  these positions can be significant 
all unhedged metal transactions are monitored and marked to market daily 
the portion of this metal that has not been hedged is therefore subject to price risk and is disclosed in note  committed metal positions and hedged metal obligations 
the fair values of materials services various spot and derivative positions are included in committed metal positions on the asset side of the consolidated balance sheet and hedged metal obligations on the liability side 
the credit performance risk associated with the fair value of derivatives in a gain position is greatly mitigated through the selection of investment grade counterparties 
precious metals most of the platinum group metals used by environmental and process technologies to manufacture products are provided in advance by the customers 
the customers often purchase these metals from materials services  but they may also be shipped in from other sources 
certain quantities of precious metals are carried at historical cost using the lifo method  which provides a better matching of current costs with current revenues 
because most of the metal was acquired some time ago  the market value of this metal  while fluctuating from year to year  has generally been substantially above cost 
while this excess of market over cost is useful in evaluating the consolidated balance sheet from a credit perspective  the annual changes are not reflected in the income statement except to the extent that periodic liquidations of lifo layers produce book profits 
lifo liquidation profits are separately disclosed and not included in the operating earnings of the technology segments 
provision for environmental remediation as addressed in note  environmental costs  the company is currently preparing  has under review  or is implementing environmental investigations and cleanup plans at several currently or formerly owned and or operated sites 
in addition  nine sites have been identified at which the company believes liability as a potentially responsible party is probable for the cleanup of contamination and natural resource damages resulting from historic disposal of hazardous substances allegedly generated by the company  among others 
the company conducts studies  as well as site surveys  to determine the extent of environmental damage and determine the necessary requirements to remediate this damage 
these studies incorporate the analysis of our internal environmental staff and consultation with legal counsel 
from these studies and surveys  a range of estimates of the costs involved is derived and a liability and related expenses for environmental remediation is recorded within this range 
the company s recorded liabilities for these issues represent its best estimates of remediation and restoration costs that may be required to comply with present laws and regulations 
these estimates are based on forecasts of future direct costs related to environmental remediation 
these estimates change periodically as additional or better information becomes available as to the extent of site remediation required  if any 
certain changes could occur that would materially affect the company s estimates and environmental remediation costs at known sites 
if the company discovers additional contamination  discovers previously unknown sites  or becomes subject to related personal or property damage  the company could incur material additional costs in connection with its environmental remediation 
the accrual for environmental cleanup related costs reported in the consolidated balance sheet at december  was million  including million for superfund sites 
these amounts represent those undiscounted costs that the company believes are probable and reasonably estimable 
for the year ended december   cash payments for environmental cleanup related matters were million 
for environmental remediation sites known as of december   if the highest estimate from the range based upon information presently available were recorded  the total estimated liability would have increased by million at december  based on existing information and currently enacted environmental laws and regulations  cash payments for environmental cleanup related matters are projected to be million for  which has already been accrued 
further  the company anticipates that the amounts of capitalized environmental projects and the expense of environmental compliance will approximate current levels 
goodwill as of december   the company had million of goodwill that  based on impairment testing completed in  is not impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we complete an impairment test of goodwill annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value 
the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair values of our reporting units  which is done by using a discounted cash flow model 
significant estimates used in our discounted cash flow model include future cash flows and long term rates of growth of our reporting units and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital 
assumptions used in determining future cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future sales forecasts 
approximately of the company s goodwill is attributable to reporting units with fair values that exceed the carrying values of the reporting units by a substantial margin 
the use of different estimates and assumptions  within the range of predictable possibilities  employed in the discounted cash flow model that measures the fair value of these reporting units  would not be expected to result in an impairment of goodwill 
the remaining of the goodwill resides in reporting units with fair values that modestly exceed the carrying values of the reporting units 
the use of different estimates and assumptions employed in the discounted cash flow model that measures the fair value of these reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill 
however  the maximum value exposed to changes in estimates and assumptions  based upon the current range of predictable possibilities  is million 
included in this amount is million of goodwill acquired with the thermal spray and coating business within the environmental technologies segment and million of goodwill related to two acquisitions that provide minerals based products within the appearance and performance technologies segment 
certain long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment reviews require a comparison of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset 
if the total of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
significant assumptions used in our undiscounted cash flow model include future cash flows attributed to the group of assets  the group of assets subject to the impairment and the time period for which the assets will be held and used 
assumptions used in determining future cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future sales forecasts 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our undiscounted cash flow model could result in undiscounted cash flows lower than the current value of our assets  thereby requiring the need to compare the carrying values to their fair values 
the use of different estimates or assumptions when determining the fair value of our property  plant and equipment may result in different values for our property  plant and equipment  and any related impairment charges also  see appearance and performance technologies md a outlook section on page 
in order to provide kaolin based products to the company s customers and the process technologies segment  the company engages in kaolin mining operations that are integrated into the manufacturing processes 
the company owns and leases land containing kaolin deposits on a long term basis 
the company does not own any mining reserves or conduct any mining operations with respect to platinum  palladium or other metals 
the kaolin mining process includes exploration  topsoil and overburden removal  extraction of kaolin and the subsequent reclamation of mined areas 
in order to match the costs of the mining process with revenues associated with kaolin based products  certain mining process costs are expensed by the company over the life of the related estimated mineable reserves 
the quality and quantity of these mineable reserves are estimated by use of mapping  drilling  sampling and assaying that are standard evaluation methods generally accepted by the minerals industry 
other estimates considered in the evaluation of the estimated mineable reserves include long term demand forecasts and the impact of future regulatory changes 
a reduction in the estimated quantity of kaolin deposits of would result in an increase of annual amortization expense of less than million 
provision for income taxes as of december   net deferred tax assets are approximately million 
the company determines its current and deferred taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the tax effect of the reversal of tax differences are recorded at rates currently enacted for each jurisdiction in which it operates 
to the extent that temporary differences will result in future tax benefit  the company must estimate the timing of their reversal  and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any deferred tax assets of the company 
the future impact on earnings from using different assumptions and or estimates cannot be reasonably quantified due to the number of scenarios and variables that are present 
as of december   the company had approximately million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire at various intervals between and the probability of not being able to utilize these operating loss carryforwards is low under a wide range of scenarios 
it is the company s policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of tax examinations 
the company establishes reserves for taxes based upon management s assessment of tax exposures under applicable accounting principles and pronouncements 
the tax reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are recorded as events occur that warrant changes to individual exposure items and to the overall tax reserve balance 
the company is regularly audited by the internal revenue service irs and the various foreign and state tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company does business 
the irs is currently examining the company s tax returns for  and as of december   the company has recorded an appropriate reserve for exposures it has determined are probable 
pensions and other postretirement postemployment costs the company s employee pension and other postretirement postemployment benefit costs and obligations are dependent on its assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  expected returns on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
the discount rate assumption is based on investment yields available at the company s measurement date of september on aa rated corporate long term bond yields 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
mortality rates are based on published data 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and recorded obligations in such future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement postemployment benefit costs and obligations 
the company has determined that its net pension cost is projected to be approximately million in  compared to million in and million in based on a review of the current environment  we have lowered our domestic and foreign long term rate of return assumptions used in determining net periodic pension expense from and  respectively  in to and  respectively  in no changes are expected for a change in the long term rate of return assumption would increase or decrease net periodic pension expense by approximately million in the company lowered its domestic and foreign discount rates for determining net periodic pension expense from and  respectively  in to and  respectively  in further adjustments are being made in to lower the domestic rate to and the foreign rate to 
this adjustment reflects industry trends and the current interest rate environment 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately million in and decrease the projected benefit obligation pbo by approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately million in and increase the pbo by approximately million 
the company used september  as the measurement date for its assets and liabilities 
assets on this date were million 
the value of the assets increased to million at december  had december  assets been used to determine net periodic pension expense  our pension expense would have decreased by approximately million 
the company expects its postretirement postemployment benefit costs to increase from million to million in this increase primarily reflects the elimination of a gain that was being amortized from plan amendments made after the initial adoption of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive transactions the company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business  the company uses a variety of techniques and instruments  including derivatives  as part of its overall risk management strategy 
the company enters into derivative agreements with a diverse group of major financial and other institutions with individually determined credit limits to reduce exposure to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
interest rate risk the company uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk of its debt related financial instruments and derivatives 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in the fair value of debt resulting from an adverse movement in interest rates 
the fair value of the company s total debt was million at december  and million at december   based on average market quotations of price and yields provided by investment banks 
a basis point increase in interest rates could result in a reduction in the fair value of total debt of million at december   compared with million at december  the company also uses interest rate derivatives to help achieve its fixed and floating rate debt objectives 
the company currently has two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of million maturing in august and three interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of million maturing in may these agreements effectively change fixed rate debt obligations into floating rate obligations 
the total notional values and maturity dates of these agreements are equal to the face values and the maturity dates of the related debt instruments 
approximately and of the company s borrowings had variable interest rates as of december  and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company uses a variety of strategies  including foreign currency forward contracts  to minimize or eliminate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with its foreign currency transactions  including metal related transactions denominated in other than us dollars 
the company uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with its foreign currency transactions 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
a adverse movement in foreign currency rates could result in a net loss of million at december   compared with million at december   on the company s foreign currency forward contracts 
however  since the company limits the use of foreign currency derivatives to the hedging of contractual and anticipated foreign currency payables and receivables  this loss in fair value for those instruments generally would be offset by a gain in the value of the underlying payable or receivable 
a adverse movement in foreign currency rates could result in an unrealized loss of million at december   compared with million at december   on the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
however  since the company views these investments as long term  the company would not expect such a loss to be realized in the near term 
commodity price risk in closely monitored situations  for which exposure levels and transaction size limits have been set by senior management  the company  from time to time  holds large  unhedged industrial commodity positions that are subject to market price fluctuations 
such positions may include varying levels of derivative commodity instruments 
all unhedged industrial commodity transactions are monitored and marked to market daily 
all other industrial commodity transactions are hedged on a daily basis  using forward  future  option or swap contracts to substantially eliminate the exposure to price risk 
these positions are also marked to market daily 
the company performed a value at risk analysis on all of its metal related commodity assets and liabilities 
the value at risk calculation is a statistical model that uses historical price and volatility data to predict market risk on a one day interval with a confidence level 
while the value at risk models are relatively sophisticated  the quantitative information generated is limited by the historical information used in the calculation 
for example  the volatility in the platinum and palladium markets in and was much greater than historical norms 
therefore  the company uses this model only as a supplement to other risk management tools and not as a substitute for the experience and judgment of senior management and dealers who have extensive knowledge of the markets and adjust positions and revise strategies as the markets change 
based on the value at risk analysis in the context of a confidence level  the maximum potential one day loss in fair value was approximately million at december   compared with million as of december  the actual one day changes in fair value of the company s metal related commodity assets and liabilities never exceeded the average of the value at risk amounts as of the yearly open and close for each of the company s and fiscal years 
the company is also exposed to commodity price risk on the unhedged portion of its natural gas purchases related to its purchase of natural gas that is used in the manufacture of its products 
as of december   the company has hedged approximately of its expected natural gas purchases for at december   a uniform one dollar increase in the price of natural gas would result in a decrease in operating earnings of approximately million for the year ending december  based upon the company s unhedged portion of its expected natural gas purchases for
