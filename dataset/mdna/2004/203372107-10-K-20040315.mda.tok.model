item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this form k 
on january  we acquired the connectivity solutions business of avaya 
the historical financial and other information included in this management s discussion and analysis for periods prior to january  reflects the business of commscope prior to our acquisition of the connectivity solutions business 
because the acquisition of the connectivity solutions business is significant to us  our historical financial information may not be indicative of our financial condition and performance for future periods 
overview we  through our wholly owned subsidiaries and equity method investee  are a leading worldwide designer  manufacturer and marketer of broadband coaxial cables and other high performance electronic and fiber optic cable products for cable television  telephony  internet access  wireless communications and other broadband services 
in january  we acquired connectivity solutions primarily to expand our position in the last mile of telecommunications  establish a leadership position in the global enterprise market and enhance our global growth opportunities 
the connectivity solutions business is a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of physical layer end to end structured cabling solutions supporting local area network applications for enterprises and telecommunications service providers 
we believe that this acquisition positions us as a leading global provider of cable products and apparatus to both the enterprise and telecommunications markets 
for the years ended december   and  the periods discussed in this management s discussion and analysis  our product groups were o broadband video coaxial  unshielded twisted pair and fiber optic cables  or combinations of each for broadband cable networks and video distribution applications such as satellite television and security surveillance 
o lan unshielded twisted pair  coaxial  and fiber optic cables to transmit data for local area network applications 
o wireless other telecom coaxial cables used to connect wireless antennae to transmitters  coaxial  fiber optic and twisted pair cables for other wireless applications  and coaxial cable for telephone central office switching and transmissions applications 
following our acquisition of the connectivity solutions business  we reorganized our products into four major product groups o commscope enterprise solutions end to end copper and fiber connectivity cabling solutions for connecting phones  workstations  local area networks and other communications devices through buildings or across campuses and unshielded twisted pair  coaxial and fiber optic cables to transmit data for enterprise lan networks 
o commscope broadband solutions coaxial  unshielded twisted pair and fiber optic cables  or combinations of each for broadband cable networks and video distribution applications such as satellite television and security surveillance 
o commscope wireless solutions coaxial cables used to connect wireless antennae to transmitters and coaxial  fiber optic and twisted pair cables for other wireless applications 
o commscope carrier solutions product solutions designed for switching and transmission applications in telephone central offices and secure environmental enclosures used by telecommunication service providers 
during the periods presented in this management s discussion and analysis  our primary source of revenue was product sales to cable television system operators  television service providers  original equipment manufacturers and distributors 
demand for our cable products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television operators for maintaining  constructing and rebuilding or upgrading their systems 
the primary source of revenues for the connectivity solutions business are product sales to large  multinational companies  which are made primarily through a global network of distributors  system integrators  and value added resellers 
demand for connectivity solutions products depends primarily on capital spending by enterprises on communications projects in new buildings or campuses  building expansions or upgrades of network systems within buildings or campuses 
our future financial condition and performance will be dependent  in large part  on our ability to successfully integrate and operate the connectivity solutions business  and on economic conditions in the industries in which we operate 
our revenues and profitability are affected by increasing consolidation in the telecommunications industry and the financial condition of our major customers  which  when economic conditions decline as has occurred in recent years  may result in write offs of our receivables  the impairment of certain of our manufacturing assets and reductions in our workforce 
our profitability is also affected by the mix of sales among our various product lines  the type and amount of products sold  competitive pricing pressures and changes in the market price of our raw materials  many of which are linked to the commodity markets 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of increases in raw material prices through effective requirements planning and by working closely with key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers without a significant decrease in sales  cost increases could have a material effect on our operations 
in  we invested in ofs brightwave  and entered into related supply arrangements with furukawa  to provide access to optical fiber  enhance our technology platform and create a strategic partner in optical fiber and fiber optic cable manufacturing 
ofs brightwave has incurred substantial losses for the past three years primarily due to the weak demand for optical fiber and fiber optic cable and the impact of significant charges related to the impairment of goodwill and certain fixed and intangible assets as well as restructuring and employee separation costs 
our results of operations for the past three years were adversely affected by the significant noncash losses we recognized from our investment in ofs brightwave 
the losses incurred by ofs brightwave through december  reduced our equity in the net assets of ofs brightwave to zero 
our share of ofs brightwave s losses in excess of its equity investment was recognized for accounting purposes as a reduction of our notes receivable from ofs brightwave to million as of december  despite this accounting adjustment  ofs brightwave s contractual obligation under the notes receivable remains at million 
we expect to continue to recognize noncash losses from our investment in ofs brightwave through critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates  as appropriate  when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
this discussion of critical accounting policies addresses our historical financial data and therefore does not reflect our acquisition of the connectivity solutions business on january   and the related financing  and therefore may not include all of our critical accounting policies for future periods 
significant accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for sales returns  discounts  allowances  and rebates and distributor price protection reserves  inventory excess and obsolescence reserves  income tax valuation allowances  impairment reviews for investments  fixed assets  goodwill and other intangibles  and postretirement benefit obligations 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on management s evaluation of the ability of our customers to make payments  focusing on customer financial difficulties and age of receivable balances 
an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers could materially affect management s estimates related to doubtful accounts 
reserves for sales returns  discounts  allowances and rebates and distributor price protection reserves we record estimated reductions to revenue for potential sales returns as well as customer programs and incentive offerings  such as discounts  allowances  rebates and distributor price protection programs 
these estimates are based on contract terms  historical experience  inventory levels in the distributor channel  and other factors 
management believes it has sufficient historical experience to allow for reasonable and reliable estimation of these reductions to revenue 
however  declining market conditions could result in increased estimates of sales returns and allowances and potential distributor price protection incentives  resulting in incremental reductions to revenue 
inventory excess and obsolescence reserves we maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of the cost or market principle  including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
these reserves are based on management s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog  shipment experience  forecasted demand and market conditions 
we do not believe our products are subject to a significant risk of obsolescence in the short term and management believes it has the ability to adjust production levels in response to declining demand 
however  if actual market conditions become less favorable than anticipated by management  additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required 
income tax valuation allowances we establish an income tax valuation allowance when available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider the amounts and timing of future deductions or carryforwards and sources of taxable income that may enable utilization 
we intend to maintain an existing valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or in future income may have a material impact on the amount of a deferred tax asset ultimately realized 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
impairment reviews management reviews intangible assets  investments  and other long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of august and on an interim basis when events or circumstances change 
management assesses potential impairment of the carrying values of these assets based on market prices  if available  or assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows expected to arise from these assets 
operating performance  market conditions  and other factors may adversely impact future cash flows 
if an impairment is indicated by this analysis  the impairment charge to be recognized  if any  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value  estimated by management based on market prices  if available  or forecasted cash flows  discounted using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates involve management judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
if actual future cash flows  discount rates and other assumptions used in the assessment and measurement of impairment differ from management s estimates and forecasts  additional impairment charges could be required 
postretirement benefit obligations our postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
the most critical assumption inherent in these valuations is the discount rate 
the discount rate is subject to change each year  consistent with changes in applicable high quality  long term corporate bond indices 
based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans  we base our discount rate on the moody s aa corporate bond rate 
other assumptions include claims costs  contributions  mortality rates and demographics 
changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on future postretirement benefit costs 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  of of net net dollar millions sales millions sales change change net sales gross profit sg a expense r d expense net loss net loss per share net sales net sales decreased due to lower sales of broadband video products to certain domestic broadband service providers and lower sales of fiber optic cable 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in net sales related to our lan products and our wireless and other telecom products 
the following table presents in millions our revenues by broad product group as well as domestic versus international sales for the years ended december  and of net of net dollar net sales sales net sales sales change change broadband video products lan products wireless other telecom products total worldwide sales domestic sales international sales total worldwide sales the decrease in net sales of broadband video products primarily resulted from a lower volume of sales to certain domestic broadband service providers  including charter communications  inc  referred to herein as charter  comcast corporation  referred to herein as comcast  and adelphia communication corporation  referred to herein as adelphia  in addition to a significant decline in fiber optic cable pricing 
comcast merged with at t broadband in november during the year ended december   comcast accounted for approximately of our net sales compared to approximately of our net sales as if they were combined with at t broadband for the full year ended december  accounts receivable from comcast comprised approximately of the company s net accounts receivables as of december   compared to  as of december  international sales  primarily for broadband video products  were relatively stable 
while we do not expect rapid recovery in the international markets  we remain optimistic about the long term opportunities for broadband cable because the global business environment appears to be improving 
at the same time  we face increased pricing pressure for coaxial cable  a key component of our broadband video products  as a result of ongoing competitive pressures 
we also expect ongoing pricing pressure and weak demand industry wide for fiber optic cable products for broadband applications through the increase in net sales of lan products was primarily driven by a higher volume of sales of fiber optic cable and improved project business 
we believe that the business environment for our lan products is improving based on the improvement in general economic conditions  which has led to increased spending by our customers 
additionally  we announced two price increases for our lan products in the first quarter of as a result of significant increases in the cost of certain raw materials 
the increase in net sales of wireless and other telecom products was mainly due to a higher volume of sales primarily in wireless products 
the improvement in general economic conditions has led to increased spending by the major wireless carriers 
in addition  we have developed relationships with new customers  who are generally purchasing larger diameter products  which have comparatively higher prices 
we believe we continue to make steady progress communicating the cell reach r value proposition to new and existing customers  both domestically and internationally 
while we expect sales of wireless products to be somewhat volatile since customer spending is mainly project driven  we remain optimistic about our long term global wireless opportunities primarily as a result of improving global economic conditions 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales although gross profit declined by approximately primarily due to lower sales  gross profit margin remained stable at of net sales 
an increase in the cost of certain raw materials was offset by cost savings due to the reduction in workforce in and early detailed below 
we expect the rising cost of raw materials such as plastics and polymers  which are derived from oil and natural gas  and copper to result in increased cost of sales 
although we expect to recover these costs by raising prices of certain products  the inability to achieve market acceptance of the price increases could result in lower gross profit and gross profit margin 
while gross profit margins for broadband video and lan products were relatively stable  gross profit margins for wireless and other telecom products increased significantly 
however  gross profit margins for wireless and other telecom products are below corporate average and are volatile as a result of aggressive competition  mix and ongoing pricing pressures 
we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or  during the third quarter of in december  we announced an additional reduction of our workforce of approximately employees  or  that was effective in january the reductions were primarily in response to the challenging global business environment 
we recorded total pretax charges related to these workforce reductions of approximately million in cost of sales for employee termination benefits during selling  general and administrative expense the higher selling  general and administrative expense  referred to herein as sg a  in was primarily due to the bad debt expense incurred in related to the write off of adelphia receivables  which totaled million 
excluding the adelphia write off  sg a expense increased million  or  during  which was primarily driven by higher insurance premiums and increased incentive compensation and other employee benefit costs 
sg a expenses for the year ended december  also included approximately million related to the then pending acquisition of connectivity solutions 
we have taken charges for doubtful accounts as a result of the difficult market environment based on our analysis of customer financial difficulties  age of receivable balances  and other relevant factors 
research and development research and development  referred to herein as r d  expense as a percentage of net sales remained stable at approximately of net sales 
during  our major r d projects consisted of research and engineering activities related to expanding our drop cable and lan optical fiber product offerings 
we also are focused on developing more cost effective product designs 
impairment charges for fixed assets and investments during  we concluded that certain manufacturing assets had uncertain use to us in the foreseeable future and initiated a formal impairment review of these assets 
most of these assets were used in or acquired for use in the manufacture of our broadband video products  which have been adversely affected by the difficult global business environment in telecommunications and an ongoing decline in demand both domestically and internationally 
based primarily on third party appraisals  we recognized pretax impairment charges in the amount of million  or per share  net of tax  related to these specifically identified assets 
in addition  our brazilian operation  which primarily manufactures broadband video products  has experienced declining local demand in addition to reduced export sales and profitability resulting from pricing and competitive pressures primarily due to the recent impact of unfavorable local currency fluctuations 
as a result  we performed a test of recoverability for the brazilian manufacturing assets during based on third party appraisals  we recognized pretax impairment charges in the amount of million  or per share  net of tax  related to brazilian manufacturing assets 
in total  we recognized pretax impairment charges for fixed assets in the amount of million  or per share  net of tax  during the second quarter of the breakdown of these impairment charges was as follows in millions domestic broadband cable manufacturing assets brazilian manufacturing assets other domestic manufacturing assets total impairment charges due to the difficult business environment in telecommunications and the continuing decline in demand for our products  we performed a test of recoverability for our long lived assets during as a result of this impairment test described below  we recognized pretax impairment charges for fixed assets in the amount of million  or per share  net of tax  during the break down of these impairment charges was as follows in millions wireless cable manufacturing assets fiber optic cable manufacturing assets other telecommunications cable manufacturing assets other manufacturing assets total impairment charges our long term undiscounted cash flow forecasts indicated that the carrying amounts of fixed assets used to manufacture our wireless  fiber optic cable and other telecom products may not be recoverable as of september  in addition  our quarterly review of idle and obsolete fixed assets indicated additional impairment for specifically identified manufacturing equipment 
the impairment loss recognized in the third quarter of was measured as the amount by which the carrying values of the impaired assets exceeded their respective fair values 
fair values were determined using the best available information  including independent appraisal  third party and internal market value estimates  and discounted cash flows 
net interest expense net interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  although our average interest rate increased  net interest expense decreased primarily due to lower average outstanding balances on long term debt 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for the years ended december  and equity in losses of ofs brightwave  llc for the years ended december  and  our share of the losses of ofs brightwave was approximately million and million  pretax  respectively 
since ofs brightwave has elected to be taxed as a partnership  we recorded a tax benefit related to our share in the flow through losses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
ofs brightwave operates in some of the same markets we do and its financial results were also adversely affected by the ongoing difficult global business conditions 
as a result  ofs brightwave incurred pretax losses of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the losses included charges of million related primarily to the impairment of certain fixed assets and intangible assets  restructuring and employee separation costs 
the losses included charges of million  net of a million tax benefit from losses generated by a domestic c corporation subsidiary of ofs brightwave  for the write off of goodwill and certain fixed assets  restructuring and employee separation costs and other cost reduction activities 
due primarily to the difficult market environment for certain telecommunications products and challenging global economic conditions  we expect ongoing pricing pressure and weak global demand for fiber optic cable products through while we believe that ofs brightwave has reduced its cost structure through restructuring efforts  we believe that ofs brightwave will continue to incur losses through  and as a result  we expect to continue to recognize noncash losses from our investment in ofs brightwave 
despite these expected losses  we believe our investment in ofs brightwave and our strategic relationship with furukawa have enhanced our competitive position with the domestic broadband and lan service providers 
in addition  ofs brightwave is party to manufacturing and supply agreements with ofs fitel  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of furukawa 
as a result of furukawa s controlling interest in both ventures  it has significant influence over the structure and pricing of these agreements 
future changes in these terms  over which we have limited influence  could have a material impact on the profitability of ofs brightwave and ultimately on our results of operations 
furukawa recently stated that it believes it is in the last stages of restructuring the ofs business 
among other actions  ofs brightwave plans to move certain cable production from the norcross facility to the carrollton facility during the next few months 
while we believe that these restructuring actions are appropriate  they could reduce our ownership interest in ofs brightwave because we do not intend to make further investments in ofs brightwave 
a reduction in our ownership percentage has no effect on our contractual right to sell our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa in for a cash payment equal to our original investment in and advances to ofs brightwave 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  of of net net dollar millions sales millions sales change change net sales gross profit sg a expense r d expense net income loss net income loss per share net sales net sales decreased due to the challenging global business environment in telecommunications  which continues to result in reduced demand for many product lines both domestically and internationally 
additionally  net sales were impacted by reduced shipments to adelphia and ongoing competitive pricing pressures for fiber optic cable  wireless and other telecommunications products 
the following table presents in millions our revenues by broad product group as well as domestic versus international sales for the years ended december  and of net of net dollar net sales sales net sales sales change change broadband video products lan products wireless other telecom products total worldwide sales domestic sales international sales total worldwide sales the decrease in net sales of broadband video products was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes  and was significantly affected by the downturn in international demand 
during the year ended december   comcast  as if combined with at t broadband for the full year  accounted for approximately of our net sales  compared to approximately of our net sales as if they were combined for the full year ended december  the impact of increased sales to comcast  on a pro forma basis for the full year  was more than offset by lower shipments to adelphia and charter  in addition to lower sales of fiber optic cable 
domestic broadband video sales decreased approximately year over year 
the decrease in domestic sales of broadband video products was driven primarily by reduced shipments to adelphia and charter and significant pricing pressures for fiber optic cable 
international sales  primarily for broadband video products  also declined year over year with sales down in nearly all regions mainly due to the difficult global business environment 
the decrease in sales of lan products was primarily driven by lower volume resulting from year end inventory reductions by distributors and pricing pressure due to difficult market conditions 
although our sales were impacted by the loss of graybar electric company  inc  previously one of our leading distribution channels for lan and other video related products  we believe that we were able to offset the lost sales in lan products by redirecting project business and utilizing our strong brand recognition 
the decrease in net sales of wireless and other telecom products was primarily due to the combination of lower volume and pricing pressure 
the general slowdown in telecommunications capital spending and the inability of certain customers to get financing for their projects has had a significant impact on sales of our wireless products  and we have experienced aggressive competition in the wireless market 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales the decreases in gross profit and gross profit margin were primarily due to lower sales volumes and competitive pricing pressure for certain products  including fiber optic cable and lan products 
we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or  during the third quarter of in december  we announced an additional reduction of our workforce of approximately employees  or  that was effective in january the reductions were primarily in response to the challenging global business environment 
we recorded total pretax charges related to these workforce reductions of approximately million in cost of sales for employee termination benefits during selling  general and administrative expense the increase in sg a expense was primarily due to the increase in bad debt expense related to the write off of adelphia receivables in  which totaled million 
excluding the adelphia write off  sg a expense declined slightly for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we believe we have taken appropriate charges for doubtful accounts as a result of the difficult market environment based on our analysis of customer financial difficulties  age of receivable balances  and other relevant factors 
the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales  excluding the write off of adelphia receivables in  was primarily due to sales declining faster than sales and marketing expenses  as well as our ongoing investment in our information technology infrastructure 
research and development r d expense as a percentage of net sales remained stable at for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during  our major projects consisted of research and engineering activities related to developing new and more cost effective cable designs 
also  we continued research and engineering activities related to the production of certain copper clad metals in order to advance the design of those materials and related processes to the point that they meet specific functional and economic requirements 
we undertook this project in an effort to reduce material costs and reliance on limited sources of key raw materials and incorporated the new designs and related processes into production during the third quarter of terminated acquisition costs our acquisition of an ownership interest in ofs brightwave as of november  was restructured from a previously contemplated joint venture arrangement announced july  under the originally contemplated arrangement  we would have formed two joint ventures with furukawa to acquire certain fiber optic cable and transmission fiber assets of lucent s ofs group 
given the uncertain economic environment and severe downturn in the telecommunications market as well as associated difficulties in the financing markets following the september  tragedy  we agreed with furukawa to restructure the joint venture arrangements  resulting in a reduced ownership participation for us 
as a result of the restructuring of this venture  we recorded pretax charges of approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax  during  related to financing and formation costs of the original joint venture arrangements  which are not capitalizable as part of our investment in the restructured venture 
impairment charges for fixed assets and investments as described above  due to the difficult business environment in telecommunications and the continuing decline in demand for our products  we performed a test of recoverability for our long lived assets during as a result of this impairment test  we recognized pretax impairment charges for fixed assets in the amount of million  or per share  net of tax  during during we recorded pretax charges of approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax  related to the impairment of certain assets 
management identified specific assets that were determined to have no future use in our operations and assets whose anticipated undiscounted future cash flows were less than their carrying values 
these impairment adjustments included equipment charges and a write down of our kings mountain facility  which was under construction 
the impairment charges also included the write off of an investment in a wireless infrastructure project management company  which has been substantially liquidated and whose fair value was determined to be zero 
the tax benefit of the capital loss arising from impairment of this investment has been offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainty about our ability to utilize this tax deduction 
net interest expense net interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower average outstanding balances on long term debt and lower variable interest rates 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for the years ended december  and equity in losses of ofs brightwave  llc for the year ended december   our equity interest in the losses of ofs brightwave was approximately million  pretax 
for the six week period from november  to december   our equity interest in the losses of ofs brightwave was approximately million  pretax 
since ofs brightwave has elected to be taxed as a partnership  we recorded a tax benefit related to our equity interest in the flow through losses of approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the six week period ended december  although ofs brightwave benefited from revenue expansion and cost reduction efforts during  ofs brightwave operates in some of the same markets we do and its financial results were also adversely affected by the downturn in the global economy and the telecommunications industry 
due primarily to these conditions  ofs brightwave incurred losses of million during the year ended december   nearly half of which resulted from charges for the write off of goodwill and certain fixed assets  restructuring and employee separation costs and other cost reduction activities 
the total of these charges recognized by ofs brightwave during was million  net of a million tax benefit from losses generated by a domestic c corporation subsidiary of ofs brightwave 
the losses of approximately million incurred by ofs brightwave during the six week period ended december  were impacted by nonrecurring startup and organizational costs of approximately million  related to the write off of in process research and development  separation from lucent and commencement of independent operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow overview our principal sources of liquidity both on a short term and long term basis are cash and cash equivalents  cash flows provided by operations and availability under credit facilities 
reduced sales and profitability could reduce cash provided by operations and limit availability under credit facilities 
in addition  increases in working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents  related to increasing sales could reduce our operating cash flows in the short term until cash collections of accounts receivable catch up to the higher level of billings 
dollar change change cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities working capital  excluding cash capital expenditures long term debt  including current maturities book capital structure long term debt as a of book capital structure the increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven by cash flows from operating activities  which included initial proceeds of million from the assignment of our trade claims against adelphia and its affiliates to a third party in and a million tax refund  which primarily related to the carryback of deductible losses from ofs brightwave and the write off of adelphia receivables 
our cash balance decreased in the first quarter of as a result of the million cash payment to avaya for the acquisition of connectivity solutions  which was effective as of january  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased year over year primarily due to more stable accounts receivable and inventory levels in compared to in  both accounts receivable and inventory levels declined from december  levels partly due to lower sales in than and partly due to improved receivables collections 
we expect to incur cash charges of up to million  primarily during the first six months of  for startup  transition and other costs related to the acquisition of the connectivity solutions business 
however  the impact of purchase accounting adjustments  which we expect will significantly affect operating results during the first half of  are primarily noncash in nature 
the decrease in working capital  excluding cash  was primarily due to receipt of a million tax refund in  as discussed above  which was recorded in other current assets as of december  excluding this million tax receivable  working capital was stable year over year at of net sales 
we expect working capital to increase as a percentage of sales in as a result of the connectivity solutions acquisition 
however  we believe that we can improve working capital performance of the connectivity solutions business by reducing inventory and improving inventory turnover 
investing activities capital expenditures in included the acquisition of a previously leased corporate office building for million 
the additional capital spending during and was primarily for projects related to vertical integration  capacity expansion  and equipment upgrades 
we currently expect total capital expenditures  including spending for the connectivity solutions business  to be approximately million in  primarily for cost reduction efforts  information technology initiatives and additional production capability in asia 
we expect total capital expenditures  including spending for the connectivity solutions business  to remain at a level below consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for the next several years 
financing activities as of november   we terminated our amended million revolving credit agreement  which was scheduled to expire on december  we then entered into a million secured credit facility that closed january  the facility was not drawn at december  we had availability under this facility of approximately million at december  we replaced this facility on january  in connection with our acquisition of connectivity solutions as described below 
effective january   we completed the acquisition from avaya of substantially all of the assets  subject to current liabilities  of connectivity solutions except for certain international operations that are expected to be completed later this year 
the total purchase price consisted of million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments  and approximately million shares of our common stock 
those shares were valued at million 
we have received a demand from avaya for registration of those shares and we will proceed in accordance with the terms of the related registration rights agreement 
additionally  as part of the transaction we assumed up to million of other specified liabilities of connectivity solutions primarily related to employee benefits 
the cash portion of the purchase price for the connectivity solutions business consisted of million from our existing cash balances and million from borrowings under a new year million senior secured credit facility 
the new secured credit facility  which amended and restated our previous secured credit facility  is comprised of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  is guaranteed by all of our material domestic subsidiaries and contains certain financial and restrictive covenants 
the term loan facility is required to be repaid by us in consecutive quarterly installments of million from march  to september   million on december  and million on each quarterly payment date thereafter with a final payment of all outstanding principal and interest on december  the revolving loan and term loan under our senior secured credit facility become immediately due and payable if our convertible subordinated notes are not converted into shares of our stock or repaid in full by june the interest rate on the million term loan facility is  at our option  either the eurodollar rate plus to  or the alternative base rate plus to  in each case based on our fixed charge coverage ratio 
the interest rate on the million revolving credit facility is  at our option  either the eurodollar rate plus to or the alternative base rate plus to  in each case based on our fixed charge coverage ratio 
our ability to borrow under this revolving credit facility depends on the amount of our borrowing base  which is determined as specified percentages of our eligible receivables and inventory less certain reserves 
following the million cash payment for the acquisition of connectivity solutions  which was effective as of january   we had cash balances of approximately million and availability under this new revolving credit facility of approximately million  net of outstanding borrowings  and  although we were not required to perform covenant testing as of this date  we believe we were in compliance with all of our covenants 
as of october   we  together with furukawa  purchased million shares of our common stock from lucent 
the total purchase price paid to lucent by us and furukawa on october  for the million shares was approximately million  or per share 
of the total million shares of our common stock purchased from lucent  furukawa purchased approximately million shares  which we understand it plans to hold for investment purposes 
we repurchased the remaining approximately million shares  which are currently classified as treasury stock 
we funded our million repurchase using existing cash balances 
as of december  and  furukawa owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in conjunction with this stock purchase  we also entered into agreements with furukawa that outline various investment terms  including resale restrictions  registration rights  standstill provisions  as well as call and limited put rights related to our shares held by furukawa 
additionally  we agreed with furukawa to change from to the date when we could first exercise our contractual right to sell our investment in ofs brightwave to furukawa for a cash payment equal to our original investment in and advances to ofs brightwave 
if we exercise our contractual right to sell our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa  furukawa would  at that time  have the right to require us to purchase the million shares of our common stock owned by furukawa for an aggregate price of million 
future cash needs we expect that our primary future cash needs will be to fund working capital  transition  startup and other costs related to the acquisition of connectivity solutions  capital expenditures  debt service  and employee obligations 
we expect to incur transition and other costs related to our recent acquisition of the connectivity solutions business of approximately million  primarily for information technology  transition services and other acquisition related costs 
we expect to incur most of these transition costs during the first and second quarters of in addition  we have assumed up to million of other specified liabilities in this transaction  primarily related to employee benefits 
these noncurrent employee benefit liabilities will be funded with cash flow from future operations 
we believe that our existing cash and cash flows from operations  combined with availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs 
we may  from time to time  borrow under our revolving credit facility or issue securities  if market conditions are favorable  to meet our future cash needs or to reduce our borrowing costs 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions amount of payments due per period total payments less than contractual obligations due year years years after years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations pension liabilities postretirement benefit liabilities foreign currency derivative total contractual obligations in addition to the contractual obligations listed above  we are contractually obligated to pay million per year through for interest on our million convertible notes 
effects of inflation and changing prices we continually attempt to minimize any effect of inflation on earnings by controlling our operating costs and selling prices 
during the past few years  the rate of inflation has been low and has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
the principal raw materials purchased by us fabricated aluminum  plastics and polymers  bimetals  copper and optical fiber are subject to changes in market price as these materials are linked to the commodity markets 
prices for copper  fluoropolymers and certain polymers derived from oil and natural gas have increased substantially over the last twelve months 
as a result  we have significantly increased our prices for certain enterprise products and may have to increase prices again in the future 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers without a significant decrease in sales  the cost increases could have a material impact on the results of our operations 
other we are either a plaintiff or a defendant in pending legal matters in the normal course of business  however  we believe none of these legal matters will have a materially adverse effect on our financial statements upon final disposition 
in addition  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing the use  discharge  disposal and remediation of hazardous materials 
compliance with current laws and regulations has not had  and is not expected to have  a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

european monetary union euro effective january   member countries of the european monetary union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies  and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro began trading on currency exchanges 
the legacy currencies of the participating countries remained legal tender for a transition period between january  and january  we conduct business in member countries 
during the transition period  cashless payments for example  wire transfers could be made in the euro  and parties to individual transactions could elect to pay for goods and services using either the euro or the legacy currency 
between january  and february   the participating countries introduced euro notes and coins and will eventually withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
european legislation provides that  unless otherwise agreed  the introduction of the euro will not  by itself  give any party to a contract the right to terminate the contract  or to demand renegotiation of the terms 
as of december   we believe we have adequately addressed the issues involved with the introduction of the euro 
among the issues which we faced were the assessment and conversion of information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and the eventual elimination of legacy currencies 
we have also modified certain existing contracts  if required  and have revised our pricing marketing strategies in the affected european markets to the extent necessary for the introduction of the euro 
in addition  our belgian subsidiary successfully completed the conversion of its financial systems and share capital to the euro 
we do not believe the euro conversion has had or will have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have established a risk management strategy that includes the reasonable use of derivative and non derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks resulting from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
derivative financial instruments which may be used by us  include commodity pricing contracts  foreign currency exchange contracts  and contracts hedging exposure to interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  nor do we engage in speculation 
materials  in their finished form  account for a large portion of our cost of sales 
these materials  such as fabricated aluminum  plastics and polymers  bimetals  copper and optical fiber  are subject to changes in market price as they are linked to the commodity markets 
management attempts to mitigate these risks through effective requirements planning and by working closely with our key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms 
however  increases in the prices of certain commodity products could result in higher overall production costs 
approximately of our sales were to customers located outside the united states  compared to in although we primarily bill customers in foreign countries in us dollars  a portion of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly sales from our foreign subsidiaries 
significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our international sales levels and the related collection of amounts due 
in addition  a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain regions of the world as compared to the us dollar could adversely affect product sales in those regions because our products may become more expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency 
the acquisition of our belgian subsidiary created a specific market risk that a decline in the value of the euro compared to the us dollar could adversely affect our net investment in that subsidiary 
prior to its termination  our eurodollar credit agreement served as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in our belgian subsidiary 
on december   we terminated this hedging relationship and entered into a cross currency rate and forward foreign exchange agreement  which we designated as a new hedge of a portion of our net investment in our belgian subsidiary 
our investment in brazil during created a new foreign subsidiary and a specific market risk that a decline in the value of the brazilian real compared to the us dollar could adversely affect our net investment in that subsidiary 
we continue to evaluate alternatives to help us reasonably manage the market risk of our net investment in the brazilian subsidiary 
as of december   the only derivative financial instrument outstanding was a cross currency rate and forward foreign exchange agreement  which serves as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in our belgian subsidiary 
settlement of the fair value of this net investment hedging instrument as of december  and would have resulted in a loss of million and million  respectively  net of tax 
these unrealized losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
at december   we were continuing to evaluate hedging alternatives related to foreign currency exposures 
in addition  we evaluated our commodity pricing exposures and concluded that it was not currently practical to use derivative financial instruments to hedge our current commodity price risks 
our non derivative financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  trade payables  and debt instruments 
at december  and  the carrying values of each of the financial instruments recorded on our balance sheet were considered representative of their respective fair values due to their variable interest rates and or short terms to maturity  with the exception of our convertible debt  which was recorded in the financial statements at million  but had a fair value of million at december  and million at december  fair value of our debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis  based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of arrangements  or quoted market prices whenever available 
the following tables summarize our market risks associated with long term debt and foreign currency exposure as of december  and the tables present principal and interest cash outflows and related interest rates by year of maturity 
variable interest rates for each year represent the interest rate effective for the related loan as of december  for the first table and as of december  for the second table 
the interest cash outflows for the eurodollar credit agreement  disclosed below  include the effect of the interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converted the variable interest payments to a fixed rate basis 
the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the euro denominated principal and interest payments into us dollars are based on the actual exchange rates on the dates of the payments in in addition  the foreign currency exchange rate used to disclose the net interest payments under the cross currency swap agreement was based on the usd eur exchange rate as of december  for the first table and as of december  for the second table 
the tables assume payments will be made in accordance with due dates in the respective agreements and no prepayment of any amounts due  with the exception of the prepayment of million under our eurodollar credit agreement in late the tabular format used below does not reflect our option to redeem all or a portion of the million convertible notes at any time on or after december  at redemption prices specified in the indenture 
if we were to redeem the million convertible notes prior to december   the redemption price would be of the principal amount
