item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below  and to consider all forward looking statements in light of the risks and uncertainties described under the heading outlook and risk factors under item below 
item business development and description of business xeta technologies  inc  xeta  the company  we  or our an oklahoma corporation formed in  is a leading provider of communications solutions including converged systems applications such as voip  wireless  contact centers  unified messaging  video solutions  as well as traditional voice and data solutions 
we specialize in providing these solutions to multi location mid size and large companies throughout the united states 
in addition to selling these products to customers  we derive a significant portion of our revenues and gross profits from the installation and maintenance of these systems  utilizing our nation wide network of company employed design engineers and service technicians as well as our hour  days per week call center located in our headquarters building in broken arrow  oklahoma 
we entered the commercial market as a voice and data integrator in fiscal prior to that time  our traditional focus had been on the telecommunications needs of the lodging industry  selling and servicing our own proprietary call accounting systems and hitachi pbx systems 
early in  we became a reseller of avaya  inc  avaya formerly lucent technologies pbx systems 
in late  we acquired st 
louis based us technologies systems  inc ust  which largely established for us a nationwide beachhead to deliver telephony applications to the broader commercial market 
in early  we acquired portland  oregon based advanced communications technologies  which allowed us to strengthen our services and sales presence in the pacific northwest and add competencies in call centers  unified messaging  converged systems and data networking systems 
late in  we acquired st 
louis based pro networks corporation  which allowed us to enter the voip market and more firmly entrenched us in the traditional data networking market 
concurrently with this acquisition  we also acquired seattle based kmi  inc  a consulting firm specializing in lan wan networking solutions and unified messaging 
in june  we became a premium partner with nortel networks  inc nortel networks 
nortel networks share of the us communications market is similar in size and loyalty to that of avaya 
therefore  we have significantly expanded our potential market by adding this product line 
despite battling difficult economic conditions for the past three years  we believe our long term strategy of becoming an integrated communications solutions provider to the broader commercial market has proven to be on target 
in our view  the market acceptance of converged voice and data products  specifically voip products  is finally accelerating and we have recently enhanced our market position by adding the nortel networks product line to our existing avaya and hitachi products  effectively doubling our market of potential customers 
in addition  we have steadily increased both the depth and breadth of our technical capabilities in these new technologies  further establishing ourselves as one of the premier voice and data integrators in the united states  and one of the few that has nation wide reach 
we completed fiscal financially stronger than at any time in the past three years 
having maintained our profitability throughout the economic downturn by carefully controlling our costs  we have also shed more than  in debt since october  during the fourth quarter of this year  we moved our credit facility to a new bank and restructured the remaining debt on more favorable terms  thereby reducing our per quarter cash flow previously committed to debt reduction by over  under our new credit facility  we have million available under a revolving line of credit for working capital expansion 
as we enter fiscal  the economy appears to be improving and the pessimism that has plagued the business sector for three years seems to be improving 
in addition  most communications equipment providers  ourselves included  have experienced improved order rates during the last portion of calendar however  since early there have been several short periods of improvement like this  only to be followed by swift and sudden downturns 
therefore  we will continue to balance our investment in growth initiatives with tight cost controls until the economy is on a more stable growth track 

table of contents commercial products we sell a broad range of communications systems and software for commercial enterprises including voice over ip voip  call centers  customer relationship management  wireless  and messaging systems 
in the past three years  the technology that drives these systems has migrated from traditional  stand alone voice systems to fully networked communications servers that are integrated into data networks 
these converged voice and data systems provide customers with enhanced functionality  lower maintenance costs  and lower toll costs 
we design  install and maintain communications systems manufactured by avaya and nortel networks 
both of these manufacturers hold significant portions of the communications equipment market and are migrating their customer bases to the new converged technology platform 
we are one of the largest avaya dealers in the us avaya sells a variety of media servers and gateways 
the heart of these systems is the avaya communications manager which is an open  scalable  highly reliable and secure telephony application 
it provides user and system management functionality  intelligent call routing  application integration and extensibility  and enterprise communications networking 
the communications manager runs on proprietary avaya media servers to control a wide variety of avaya proprietary media gateways and communications devices 
we also sell avaya s media server  formerly known as the ip  to mid sized enterprises or as part of larger customers networks 
avaya also has a wide range of messaging systems marketed under the names intuity messaging solutions  octel  and partner messaging 
we also market avaya s unified messaging systems under the name unified communications center 
in a unified messaging environment  users can access voice mail  email and fax messages seamlessly throughout the day from their desktops 
as stated above  we became a premium partner with nortel networks in june  as a premium partner  we can provide a complete range of communications solutions offered by nortel networks 
this product portfolio includes solutions for circuit switched or packet switched networks 
migration from traditional telephony systems to voip is available under the meridian  succession  norstar and business communication manager family of products 
we offer nortel networks messaging systems marketed under the callpilot name 
these systems provide flexible and scaleable messaging options for call answering  automated attendant  fax messaging and desktop integration 
we market the nortel networks symposium call center product portfolio 
these multi media products combine traditional telephone contacts with web based contacts using advanced skill based routing 
networked call centers can be managed with a single platform and self service applications with advanced speech recognition which can provide hour  seven day a week convenience to customers 
nortel network s open architecture and evergreen design philosophy enables customers to benefit from changing technologies while retaining their initial investment 
we sell data networking products to the commercial market under non exclusive dealership agreements with avaya  cisco systems inc  nortel networks  and hewlett packard co 
sales of communications systems and products to the commercial market represented  and of total revenues during fiscal years  and  respectively 
hospitality products communications systems 
we distribute avaya s definity guestworks systems  hitachi s series digital communications systems  and the nortel networks product line to the hospitality industry under nationwide  non exclusive dealer agreements 
these systems are equipped with lodging specific software  which integrates with nearly all aspects of the hotel s operations 
we also offer a variety of related products such as voice mail systems  analog telephones  uninterruptible power supplies  announcement systems  and others  most of which also have lodging specific software features 
most of these products are sold in conjunction with the sale of new communications systems and  with the exception of voice mail systems  are purchased from regional and national suppliers 
call accounting products 
we also market a line of proprietary call accounting systems under the virtual xl vxl series name 
introduced in  the vxl is a pc based system designed to operate on a hotel s local or wide area network  and if that network is connected to the internet  the vxl can also be accessed via an internet connection 
the vxl systems are our latest technology in a series of call accounting products we have successfully marketed since our inception 
many of those earlier products remain in the field and are supported by our service and technical staff 
sales of communications systems and products to the lodging industry represented   and of total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 

table of contents installation and services we provide nation wide customer service  project management  professional services  installation and consulting to support our customers 
this extensive services organization is one of the key differentiators between our competitors and us 
the purchase price of our systems typically includes charges for professional services  project management activities  and installation costs  all of which are reflected as installation and service revenues in our financial statements 
our service organization includes our national service center nsc housed at our headquarters building in broken arrow  ok 
our nsc supports our customers who have purchased maintenance contracts on their systems  as well as other customers who purchase service on a time and materials basis 
we employ a network of highly trained technicians who are strategically located in major metropolitan areas and can be dispatched by the nsc to support our customers in the field or install new systems 
we also employ a cadre of design engineers the professional services organization pso trained in the design of the new  converged networks discussed above 
the pso provides high end services to assist our customers in navigating their way to a cost effective and productivity boosting network design 
much of the work done by the pso represents pre sales work and is often not recovered in revenues  representing a significant investment 
we believe  however  that by hiring the most qualified personnel possible and keeping their talents in house  we have built a competitive advantage in the marketplace as most of our competitors do not have the financial strength to make this investment 
finally  we have a boutique software consulting operation to assist customers in microsoft exchange and unified messaging applications 
revenues from our software consulting business are mostly derived from the pacific northwest region and represent less than of total revenues 
for our distributed products  we typically pass on the manufacturer s limited warranty  which is generally one year in length 
labor costs associated with fulfilling the warranty requirements are generally borne by us 
for avaya products  we attempt to sell avaya s post warranty maintenance contracts  for which we earn a commission 
in some circumstances however  we sell our own post warranty maintenance plan 
most of these contracts are with our lodging industry customers 
nortel networks and hitachi  unlike avaya  do not have their own field service forces 
therefore  for these products  we attempt to sell our own post warranty maintenance contract 
for proprietary call accounting products sold to the lodging industry  we provide our customers with a limited one year warranty covering parts and labor 
subsequent to the expiration of the warranty  we offer after market service contracts to our lodging customers under one year and multi year service contracts 
we earn a significant portion of our recurring service revenues from lodging customers who maintain service contracts on their systems 
installation and service revenues represented   and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
marketing our marketing efforts to the commercial sector non lodging are targeted at the enterprise space  which we define as mid sized to large commercial customers 
we especially prefer complex  multi site applications in which we can leverage our in house pso capabilities and our standard nation wide implementation capabilities 
we market our products and services primarily through our direct sales force  but also through a variety of other means including networking at trade shows and conferences  and through relationships with avaya s direct sales force 
through these relationships  avaya selects dealers to assist in fulfilling a customer s order for some of its major accounts 
we have carefully positioned ourselves as a preferred dealer by building our in house engineering capabilities  providing nationwide implementation services  and through access to our x service center 
we aggressively market these capabilities and differentiators to the avaya direct sales force who generally select the dealers for their accounts 
in addition to the broad commercial sector  we also have marketing initiatives in two specific markets middle market customers located in targeted metropolitan areas and the federal government 
these initiatives generally encompass having sales personnel dedicated to understanding the unique needs and buying channels of these markets and tailoring our solutions designs and implementation to these markets 
our marketing efforts to the lodging industry rely more heavily on our experience and reputation 
over the course of serving this market for years  we have built strong long term relationships with a wide range of personnel corporate hotel chain personnel  property management officials  industry consultants  hotel owners  and on site financial or operating 
table of contents officers that can be the key decision makers for the purchase of hotel telecommunications equipment 
we have relationships with nearly all hotel chains and major property management companies 
these relationships are key to our past and future success and our lodging marketing efforts are targeted at strengthening and deepening those relationships rather than the more broad promotional efforts sometimes employed in our marketing efforts to the commercial sector 
in addition  we offer a variety of sales programs to the lodging industry  the most significant of which is the xetaplan program 
under the xetaplan program  customers are provided one of our call accounting products for a period of three to five years in exchange for a monthly fee paid to us 
service on the products is also included in the contract 
for communications systems we sell to the lodging industry  we offer a package of value added services including a call accounting system and a service package with a specified number of free labor hours and weekly appointments with our certified technicians to correct minor malfunctions or to perform routine maintenance 
major customers during fiscal  we did not have any single customer that comprised more than of our revenues 
backlog at december  our backlog of orders for systems sales was million compared to million at the same time last year 
we expect all of this backlog to ship and be recognized as revenue by october  competition commercial 
the market for the communications systems products and services we sell to commercial customers is highly competitive 
as communications systems rapidly evolve from stand alone voice systems to highly integrated  software driven  ip based systems  they become subject to more rapid technological change 
we sell the avaya and nortel networks product lines to our commercial customers 
the customer bases of these two companies represent approximately of the total market for sales of communications systems 
generally  established customers have made prior investments in either an avaya or nortel networks system and they typically do not convert their communications infrastructure to another vendor s products due to the expense involved and the high level of satisfaction with the product 
therefore  most of the competition is at the dealer level competing for replacements  expansions  or upgrades to existing systems 
in the avaya product line  the dealer community is comprised of a few larger dealers with super regional or nationwide capabilities such as us  and several hundred smaller dealers  most of which concentrate on a particular metropolitan area 
in the nortel networks product line  sales of systems is dominated by a group of very large  well capitalized  and well established companies  generally known as the former regional bell operating companies rboc s 
in addition to competing with the rboc s  we also compete with other larger nortel networks dealers similar in size and financial strength to us as well as several hundred smaller dealers who focus on smaller geographies 
hospitality 
we sell avaya  hitachi  and nortel networks communications systems to the lodging market and  as such  face similar competitive pressures to those discussed above under commercial competition 
however  since the lodging market is a small  niche market  we believe our most effective competitive strengths are the performance and reliability of our proprietary hospitality systems and our high level of service commitment to this unique market 
while we believe that our reputation and nation wide presence contribute significantly to our success in the lodging market  there can be no assurance given that we will be able to continue to expand our market share in the future 
manufacturing all of the assembly of systems relates to our proprietary call accounting systems sold exclusively to the lodging industry 
as a mature product line  these systems comprise less than of our total revenues 
we assemble these products  which include the xl  virtual xl  and xpert systems  from an inventory of components  parts and sub assemblies obtained from various suppliers 
these components are purchased from a variety of regional and national distributors at prices which fluctuate based on demand and volumes purchased 
some components  although widely distributed  are 
table of contents manufactured by a single  usually foreign  source and are therefore subject to shortages and price fluctuations if manufacturing is interrupted 
we maintain adequate inventories of components to mitigate short term shortages and believe the ultimate risk of long term shortages is minimal 
our proprietary products are based on pc technology  which is continually and rapidly changing 
as a result  some of the components originally designed for use in our systems have been phased out of production and replaced by more advanced technology 
to date  these substitutions have not forced us to substantially redesign our systems and there has been minimal effect on the overall system cost 
there can be no assurance given  however  that future obsolescence of key components would not result in unanticipated delays in shipments of systems due to redesign and testing of assemblies 
we use outside contractors to assemble our proprietary printed circuit boards 
the components and blank circuit boards are purchased  inventoried  and supplied to the outside contractors for assembly and quality control testing 
we perform various quality control procedures  including powering up completed systems and allowing them to burn in before being assembled into a final unit for a specific customer location  and performing final testing prior to shipment 
employees at december   we employed employees 
there were no part time employees 
copyrights  patents and trademarks we recognize that our reputation for quality products and services gives value to our lodging products and service offerings names 
therefore  we place high importance upon protecting such names by obtaining registered trademarks where practicable and appropriate 
we own registered united states trademarks on the following names for use in the marketing of our services and systems xeta  xetaxcel  xact  xpert  xpert  xl  xpander  virtual xl  and xtramile 
all of these marks are registered on the principal register of the united states patent and trademark office  with the exception of xpander  which is registered on the supplemental register 
we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through a combination of trade secrets  non disclosure agreements  copyright claims  and technical measures 
we believe that patent protection is less significant to protecting our proprietary technology and technical expertise than the other measures listed above 
for this reason  we have never applied for patents on our hardware or software technology with the exception of the technology for xpander 
item properties our principal executive office and service center are located in a  square foot  company owned  single story building located in a suburban business park near tulsa  oklahoma 
this facility also houses our warehouse and assembly areas to support our hospitality sales channel 
the building is located on a acre tract of land 
the property is subject to a mortgage held by bank of oklahoma  na  to secure our credit facility 
our commercial channel shipping operations are primarily located in leased facilities near st 
louis  missouri 
in addition to the warehouse  this facility houses sales staff  technical design  professional services  and installation support personnel 
we also lease other office space throughout the us for sales  consulting  and technical staff and have informal office arrangements with our regional technicians to allow for some storage of spare parts inventory 
item legal proceedings on august   the software information industry association siia  an association of software publishers  contacted us by letter and claimed that we had violated the copyright act  usc  et seq 
by allegedly using unlicensed software in our business 
siia made demand that we audit all of our computers and servers to determine whether we used both licensed and or allegedly unlicensed software for any of siia s members 
we conducted this audit and determined that some software present on a limited number of our computers was unlicensed 
even though many of these programs were located on personal computers utilized by employees for both personal and business use  or on computers that were inherited through our various acquisitions and were most likely loaded prior to our acquisition of these companies  we have potential exposure to damages under the law for possessing unlicensed software 
consequently  
table of contents we have recorded a loss contingency representing our best estimate of the potential damages based upon available facts of the claim at the present time 
we initiated settlement negotiations with siia but the nature of our liability and the amount of damages due siia was in dispute 
we therefore filed a declaratory judgment in the us district court for the northern district of oklahoma on december  seeking a judicial determination of liability and damages 
based on our review of the claim  the results of our internal review of potentially unlicensed software  and discussion with legal counsel  we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of this claim will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
this action is still pending 
since  we have been monitoring numerous patent infringement lawsuits filed by phonometrics  inc  a florida company  against certain telecommunications equipment manufacturers and hotels who use such equipment 
while we were never named as a defendant in any of these cases  several of our call accounting customers were named defendants and notified us that they will seek indemnification under the terms of their contracts with us 
however  because there were other equipment vendors implicated along with us in the cases filed against our customers  we never assumed the outright defense of our customers in any of these actions 
all of the cases filed by phonometrics against our customers were originally filed in  or transferred to  the united states district court for the southern district of florida 
in october  the florida court dismissed all of the cases filed against the hotels for failure to state a claim 
after years of appeals by phonometrics  all of which were lost on the merits  a final order dismissing the cases with prejudice was entered in november  and the defendant hotels have been awarded attorney fees and costs against both phonometrics and its legal counsel 
phonometrics continues to dispute the amount of fees awarded in some cases  and this issue continues to be litigated by phonometrics

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report  we make forward looking statements regarding future events and our future performance and results 
these and other forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance  but rather reflect our current expectations  estimates  and forecasts about the industry and markets in which we operate  and our assumptions and beliefs based upon information currently available to us 
forward looking statements can generally be identified by words such as expects  anticipates  targets  plans  believes  intends  projects  estimates  and similar words or expressions 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  which are difficult to predict 
thus  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in such statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such different results include  but are not limited to  those discussed below under the heading outlook and risk factors  and in our quarterly reports on form q and other reports filed by us with the securities exchange commission 
consequently  investors are cautioned to read and consider all forward looking statements in conjunction with such risk factors and uncertainties 
further  all forward looking statements are subject to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of overview for the year ending october   we earned net income of million or 
per diluted share on revenues of million 
these results reflect an increase in earnings of on relatively flat revenues compared to fiscal this improvement in earnings reflects increases in the gross margins across all of our revenue streams despite enduring another year of depressed buying activity in the communications equipment sector 
as a result of the economic conditions  we continued to execute on short term tactics designed to carefully manage our costs  maximize operating cash flows  and preserve our technical capabilities for the future 
as a result of successfully executing these tactics and improving our gross margins  we were able to dramatically improve our profits and retire million of our debt 
in addition  we initiated limited growth initiatives  the most significant of which was to become a nortel networks nortel networks premium partner with a nation wide market reach 
by adding the nortel networks product line  we have effectively doubled our market potential because nortel network s market share is very similar to that of avaya communications avaya market share 
both nortel networks and avaya have focused their recent research and development investments on converged communications systems that allow voice communications to travel over what were previously data dedicated networks  and both companies now have deep and rich converged product selections 
approximately of the us market has an installed base of either nortel networks or avaya equipment and has been loyal to their chosen manufacturer for many years 
in addition  we believe most of these customers will likely choose to preserve their existing investment as they migrate to the new converged technology 
therefore  in almost all cases  we will offer new nortel networks products to existing nortel networks customers and offer new avaya products to existing avaya customers 
in summary  our decision to add the nortel networks product line to our product and service offerings was made to extend our market reach 
we will not de emphasize our efforts to sell avaya equipment and service products in any way 
we continue to be very optimistic about our long term prospects 
during fiscal  we have improved our efficiencies throughout our operations thereby improving our gross margins  we have slashed and restructured our debt to improve our financial condition and reduce cash flow dedicated to debt reduction  and we have preserved and enhanced our technical competence and continue to maintain our position as a premier integrator of voice and data technologies with nation wide reach 
we believe that we are well positioned for rapid growth as acceptance of these new products grows and as capital spending returns to historical levels 
the discussion that follows provides more details regarding the factors and trends which affect our financial results  liquidity  and capital resources in fiscal when compared to the previous year 

table of contents results of operations year ending october  compared to october  net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a decline 
net income for fiscal was million compared to 
million in fiscal  a increase 
discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal systems sales 
sales of systems and equipment were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease 
these results reflect the static market conditions experienced during fiscal as customers continued to defer most of their buying decisions 
in the early portion of fiscal  we experienced a spike in new orders  indicating that the market for our products was prepared to return to historical levels of growth 
however  order rates quickly returned to fiscal levels as a high degree of pessimism returned to the overall economy reflecting concerns about the iraq war and future business profits 
as we enter fiscal  we have received three large orders for new equipment  each totaling more than million 
however  except for these orders  we have not seen a change in order rates for new equipment from the levels experienced in fiscal as discussed above  we have added the nortel networks product line to our product and service offering to expand our market penetration 
we expect to start receiving orders of nortel networks equipment during the first quarter  with order rates reaching meaningful levels mid year 
nearly all of the new systems sold during fiscal were combination traditional and converged ip enabled systems or were full converged ip systems  reflecting the fact that the market is accepting the new technology that has been developed and is beginning to see economic benefits associated with it 
we fully expect this trend to continue 
however  we cannot predict at this time when macroeconomic factors will improve sufficiently for capital spending in our market to return to historical growth rates 
installation and service revenues 
revenues earned from installation and service related activities were million  an decrease from fiscal this decrease was due primarily to lower discretionary spending by customers on time and materials work 
the decrease also reflects a slow down in our microsoft consulting business 
most of our customers have focused very heavily on cost controls during the current economic downturn and  as a result  consistently defer all service work that is not essential 
also  because most companies are not increasing their employee base  they are not spending money on expansions of their systems  movement of employees  etc  all of which generate service revenues for us 
our service revenues include three other sources in addition to time and materials revenues installation revenues  contract revenues and professional services revenues 
installation revenues were flat in fiscal compared to the prior year 
this result was expected given the relatively stable level of systems sales  which is the primary driver of installation revenues 
contract revenues in fiscal were also consistent with fiscal levels 
this revenue stream continues to be derived primarily from our lodging business  which did not expand during fiscal to date  our efforts to build a similar base of recurring revenues from our commercial customers has been hampered because avaya vigorously restricts our ability to compete with them for service contracts  but instead pays us a commission for selling their contracts 
nortel networks  on the other hand  does not maintain a service department and expects dealers like us to maintain customer systems 
we believe that over time we will be able to build a base of recurring revenues from nortel networks customers similar to the base of revenues that we have enjoyed from our lodging business 
finally  we derive service revenues from our pso which provides sales support  complex implementation services  and operating systems consulting for our customers 
the consulting portion of our business declined slightly during fiscal as customers continued to limit their discretionary spending in this area 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase reflected increases in the gross margins of all our revenue sources 
gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal a portion of this increase relates to an adjustment we made during fiscal to the reserve for inventory obsolescence 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we increased the inventory reserve and systems cost of goods sold by  without this adjustment  our gross margins on systems sales in fiscal would have been 
the remainder of the improvement in systems sales reflects improvements in sales quoting processes installed during the year 
by establishing procedures to focus more closely on gross margins prior to finalizing the order and by more aggressively seeking price support from the manufacturer  we were able to significantly improve our margins on systems sales 
while we believe that these improvements can be sustained  the gross margins earned on our systems sales remains highly volatile 
the factors affecting our gross margins on systems sales include the following we sell a wide variety of products  some of which generate gross margins in excess of and some of which earn gross margins of less than  we sell to several different 
table of contents customer sets  some of which have pre negotiated contracts with avaya which result in lower margins for us  and as a distributor  we receive various forms of financial incentives from our suppliers and from avaya which can vary based on special promotions  product types purchased  the end user customer  seasonality  etc 
all of these factors contribute to the unpredictability of our systems gross margins 
the gross margins earned on installation and service revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to improvements surrounding our commercial installation cost structure and processes 
despite the fact that installation revenues declined in association with a drop in systems sales  and that a portion of the costs associated with installation activities is fixed payroll related expenses  we were still able to improve the gross margins on installations during the year by further consolidation and integration of installation related activities 
also  the margins earned by our national service center improved slightly in fiscal  reflecting additional cost controls deployed during the year 
a final component to our gross margins is the margins earned on other revenues and our corporate cost of goods sold expenses 
other revenues represent sales and cost of goods sold on equipment outside our normal provisioning processes and commissions earned on the sale of manufacturer service contracts 
corporate cost of goods sold represents the cost of our material logistics and purchasing functions 
corporate cost of goods sold declined in fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded an adjustment to decrease the reserve for bad debts by  which resulted in a reduction in bad debt expense 
without this adjustment  fiscal operating expenses would have been of revenues 
the remainder of the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was related to the loss of certain marketing reimbursement programs from avaya 
avaya replaced these programs with a different incentive system that we participated in  but the contributions received under the new incentive system only partially offset the loss of cost reimbursements under the previous program 
since april of  we have managed our operating expenses primarily by closely monitoring and managing our headcount and by implementing tight controls over discretionary expenditures 
in fiscal  we continued this course except for a few strategic investments in sales resources related to our mid market initiative 
also  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began making a few investments in technical and sales resources related to our nortel networks initiative 
in both cases  these investments were partially funded by the manufacturers under specified cost reimbursement programs 
we expect to continue this cautious course of action for the foreseeable future 
interest and other income 
interest expense consists of interest paid or accrued on our credit facility 
interest expense declined in fiscal by  reflecting lower average debt levels and lower interest rates 
also  during fiscal  we capitalized interest costs of approximately  related to our oracle implementation project compared to approximately  in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our overall bank debt by million through cash on hand and funds generated from operations 
net other expense in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other income of approximately million last year 
fiscal s results include income from the partial reversal of an acquisition related accrual set up during fiscal and interest income earned from sales type leases 
the amount of the non recurring accrual reversal recorded to other income was  we set up this accrual as part of the purchase of ust in november  to reflect the fact that we were inheriting an aggressive tax position taken by ust 
at the time of the acquisition  we chose to accrue for the potential losses to be incurred if the tax position was overturned 
after consultation with our financial and tax advisors and having monitored this matter since the time of the acquisition  we believed it was appropriate to reduce the accrual and did so last year 
there was no such entry made in fiscal tax expense 
we have recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of in all years presented 
this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to last year 
this increase reflects higher gross margins earned in fiscal while holding operating expenses relatively constant 
we believe that our current business model would support a target operating margin of 
however  we will have to realize sustained growth in our revenues  primarily through increased sales of systems to commercial customers  and hold our gross margins to reach this target 

table of contents year ending october  compared to october  net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a decline 
net income for fiscal was 
million compared to million in fiscal  a decline 
discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal systems sales 
sales of systems and equipment were million in fiscal  a decrease from fiscal this decrease consisted of a decrease in systems sales to commercial customers of million or and a decrease in systems sales to lodging customers of million or 
these decreases reflect the market conditions present during fiscal in which customers severely curtailed capital spending on telecommunications related equipment 
these decisions by customers reflected an unusually high degree of pessimism regarding the overall economy in fiscal  as customers perceived the need to use their available capital cautiously until a clear economic recovery is underway 
installation and service revenues 
revenues earned from installation and service related activities ie  installation  contracts  macs moves  adds and changes  and consulting were million in fiscal  a decrease from fiscal installation revenues  which are derived primarily from sales of new systems  decreased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
contract revenues  which have been a relatively stable source of profitability and cash flows  increased in fiscal compared to fiscal these consistent revenues were the key to our remaining profitable during the market downturn 
mac revenues decreased in fiscal as customers deferred minor upgrades  expansions  and preventative maintenance projects during the down business cycle 
consulting revenues increased in fiscal reflecting our increased emphasis on providing professional services to customers as well as the increase in complex implementations completed 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease consisted of a decrease in gross margins earned on systems sales to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and a decrease in gross margins earned on services revenues to in fiscal compared to in fiscal one of the primary factors affecting our gross margins on systems sales during fiscal was an adjustment we made to the reserve for inventory obsolescence 
during the third quarter  we increased the reserve for obsolete inventory by  this increase was charged to systems cost of goods sold in our financial statements 
without this non recurring adjustment  our gross margins on systems sales would have been 
the remainder of the decline in gross margins is related to a variety of factors including product mix  customer mix  and increasing competitive pressures 
the decline in gross margins earned on services revenues is directly related to the decline in sales of systems  which as discussed above  is the primary driver of the installation and professional services components of our services revenues 
a significant portion of our services costs of sales are relatively fixed headcount related expenses such as wages  benefits  payroll taxes  etc 
therefore  as our installation revenues declined  our margins on this component of our services revenues suffered in direct proportion 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal the decrease in operating expenses reflected cost reductions totaling approximately million produced primarily by reduced headcount  salary reductions for officers and directors  and reduced marketing expenditures to adjust to our declining revenue base  reduced commission expense of million reflecting the decrease in gross profits  a non recurring adjustment to decrease the reserve for bad debts of  and reduced amortization expense of million due to our adoption as of november  of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas regarding the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill 
interest and other income 
interest expense  which consists of interest paid or accrued on our credit facility  declined in fiscal by million  reflecting lower average debt levels 
also during fiscal  we capitalized interest costs of  related to our oracle implementation project compared to  in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our overall bank debt by million through funds generated from operations 
net other income earned in fiscal represented the partial reversal of an acquisition related accrual set up during fiscal as part of the purchase of us technologies  inc in november  to reflect the fact that we were inheriting an aggressive tax position taken by ust  and interest income earned from sales type leases 
the amount of the non recurring accrual reversal recorded to other income was  tax expense 
we recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of in all years presented 
this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 

table of contents operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in fiscal this decline primarily reflected lower gross margins earned in fiscal as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  we made significant strides in improving our financial condition and balance sheet structure 
specifically  we earned million from operations  which we combined with existing cash balances to reduce our bank debt by million  and we restructured our credit facility more appropriately to our balance sheet 
we generated these strong cash flows from operations from the following sources earnings and non cash charges of million  reduction in accounts receivable of million  reductions in inventories of million  and decreases in prepaid taxes of million 
these sources of cash flows were partially offset by million in reductions in accounts payable  yielding total cash flows from operations of million 
we used cash flows plus beginning cash balances of million to reduce our bank debt by million and to make million capital investments  primarily related to the implementation of our oracle enterprise resource system 
this system is expected to be fully implemented during fiscal we completed fiscal with only million in term and mortgage debt outstanding  a reduction of nearly million in three years despite the severe economic conditions that we have battled during this time 
also at the end of the year  we completed a restructuring of our credit facility with a new bank 
the structure of the new credit facility is similar to the previous agreement  but on more favorable terms 
the facility contains three pieces a term loan of million amortizing over months due september   a mortgage loan of million amortizing over years due september   and a million working capital revolver supported by accounts receivable and inventories  which matures on september  the company had approximately million available under the revolving line of credit at october  by re amortizing the term loan over a new month period  we have reduced our per quarter cash flow previously committed to debt reduction by over  and have shifted approximately million out of current maturities to long term debt  significantly improving our working capital position and current ratio 
in addition  our financial covenants have been reset to reflect our current financial position and earnings levels 
the financial covenants are common in such agreements including tangible net worth requirements  limitations on the amount of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda  limitations on capital spending  and debt service coverage requirements 
with these changes in place  we believe that our financial condition is greatly improved and we are well positioned to be able to support rapid increases in the demand for working capital should our business expand 
in addition to the available capacity under our working capital line of credit  we believe we have access to a variety of capital sources such as additional bank debt  private placements of subordinated debt  and public or private sales of additional equity 
however  there are currently no plans to issue such securities

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim 
table of contents financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
presently  we account for stock based employee compensation under an alternative to the fair value method allowed by sfas under this alternative method  we are only required to disclose the impact of issued stock options as if the expense had been recorded in the financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in particular  this statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying instrument to conform it to language used in fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
those changes will result in more consistent reporting of contracts as either derivatives or hybrid instruments 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our operating results  financial position  or cash flows 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas was issued in may this statement establishes standards for how certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity are classified and measured 
it requires that many financial instruments previously classified as equity now be classified as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
these financial instruments are as follows a financial instrument issued in the form of shares that is mandatorily redeemable that embodies an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem it by transferring its assets at a specified or determinable date or dates or upon an event that is certain to occur  a financial instrument  other than an outstanding share  that  at inception  embodies an obligation to repurchase the issuer s equity shares  or is indexed to such an obligation  and that requires or may require the issuer to settle the obligation by transferring assets  a financial instrument that embodies an unconditional obligation  or a financial instrument other than an outstanding share that embodies a conditional obligation  that the issuer must or may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares  if  at inception  the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on any of the following a a fixed monetary amount known at inception  for example  a payable settleable with a variable number of equity shares  b variations in something other than the fair value of equity shares  for example  a financial instrument indexed to the s p and settleable with a variable number of equity shares  c variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of equity shares  for example  a written put option that could be net share settled 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our operating results  financial position  or cash flows 
we elected to early adopt sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on november  under sfas  goodwill recorded as a part of a business combination is no longer amortized  but instead will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
as required by the new standard  we conducted an initial fair value based goodwill impairment test to determine if the carrying value of the goodwill on their balance sheet is impaired 
to assist us in our initial fair value assessment  we engaged an independent valuation consultant 
the results of our assessment indicated that no impairment existed in the value of recorded goodwill on our books as of november  additional impairment tests have been conducted by us shortly after the close of our fiscal year on both october  and the results of each of these appraisals indicated that the fair value of our reporting units in which goodwill is associated was higher than their respective carrying values on the balance sheet 
therefore no impairment loss was recognized 
an annual impairment test will be conducted in future periods shortly after the close of our fiscal year 
the adoption of sfas resulted in a reduction to our amortization expense of approximately million per year 
the goodwill for tax purposes associated with the acquisition of ust exceeded the goodwill recorded on the financial statements by  we are reducing the goodwill recorded on the financial statements for the tax effect and the tax on tax effect of the  basis difference over a year period 
accrued income taxes and deferred tax liabilities are being reduced as well 
we reduced the carrying value of goodwill by  and  for the impact of the basis difference for the years ended october  and  respectively 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the us these accounting principles require us to exercise significant judgment about future events that affect the amounts reported throughout our financial statements 
actual events could unfold quite differently than our previous judgments had predicted 
therefore the estimates and assumptions inherent in the financial statements included in this report could be materially different once those actual events are known 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or estimates were used  our financial statements could be materially different from those included in this report 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from sales of equipment based on shipment  which is generally easily determined 
revenues from installation and service activities are recognized based upon completion of the activity and customer acceptance  which sometimes requires judgment on our part 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying contract 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
we must make judgments about the collectibility of our accounts receivable to be able to present them at their net realizable value on the balance sheet 
to do this  we carefully analyze the aging of our customer accounts  try to understand why accounts have not been paid  and review historical bad debt problems 
from this analysis  we record an estimated allowance for receivables which we believe will ultimately become uncollectible 
late in fiscal  we reduced our estimated allowance for bad debts by  because of better than expected collection results 
there was no such adjustment made during fiscal we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize our credit risks and believe that our current allowance for doubtful accounts is fairly stated 
realizability of inventory values 
we make judgments about the ultimate realizability of our inventory in order to record our inventory at its lower of cost or market 
these judgments involve reviewing current demand for our products in comparison to present inventory levels and reviewing inventory costs compared to current market values 
we maintain a significant inventory of used and refurbished parts for which these assessments require a high degree of judgment 
in the second half of fiscal  we recorded increases to our provision for excess and obsolete inventories of approximately  reflecting our judgment that our provision was understated at that time 
this amount was recorded as an increase to systems cost of goods sold 
while there were additions to the reserve and write offs of worthless items in fiscal  there was not a similarly large adjustment made as in fiscal goodwill and other long lived assets 
we have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisitions made in fiscal and as required by generally accepted accounting principles  we conduct an annual goodwill impairment review immediately after the completion of the fiscal year to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
in fiscal years and  we engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist us in this review 
the results of management s assessment indicated that no impairment existed in the value of recorded goodwill on our books as of november  or october  to make this assessment in fiscal  we prepared a long term forecast of the operating results and cash flows associated with the major reporting units of our business 
we prepared this forecast in order to determine the net discounted cash flows associated with each of these units 
we then compared the value of the discounted cash flows  less bank debt  to the book value of each of those units 
based on our work in this area  we determined that the fair value  based on the discounted cash flows  was greater than our carrying value and therefore no impairment has occurred 
there is a great deal of judgment involved in making this assessment including the growth rates of our various business lines  gross margins  operating margins  discount rates  and the capital expenditures needed to support the projected growth in revenues 
we have recorded property  equipment  and capitalized software costs at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the determination of useful economic lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
accruals for contractual obligations and contingent liabilities 
on products manufactured or installed by us  we have varying degrees of warranty obligations 
we use historical trends and make other judgments to estimate our liability for such obligations 
we also must record estimated liabilities for many forms of federal  state  and local taxes 
our ultimate liability for these taxes depends upon a number of factors including the interpretation of statutes and the mix of our taxable income between higher and lower taxing jurisdictions 
in addition  from time to time we are a party to threatened litigation or actual litigation in the normal course of business 
in such cases  we evaluate our potential liability  if any  and determine if an estimate of that liability should be recorded in our financial statements 
estimating both the probability of our liability 
table of contents and the potential amount of the liability are highly subjective exercises and are evaluated frequently as the underlying circumstances change 
outlook and risk factors our business and our prospects are subject to many risks 
the following items are representative of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could affect our business  our future performance and the outcome of the forward looking statements we make 
our business is adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in the united states and  in particular  market conditions for telecommunications and networking equipment and services 
our business is directly affected by capital spending on technology equipment in the us since april  the us economy has been weak and most companies have significantly curtailed or even frozen their capital spending in general  and communications equipment in particular 
it is likely that our operating profits will not improve dramatically until this macroeconomic trend also improves 
in the short term  our business remains heavily dependent upon avaya  our primary supplier of communications equipment for resale 
also  our long term strategy includes continued commitment to the avaya product line 
although we have recently added nortel networks equipment to our product line  we do not expect sales of nortel networks products and services to be a material portion of our revenues until late fiscal consequently  in the near term  our financial results will continue to be heavily dependent upon the quality and reputation of avaya s products 
as such  our success in this market will continue to depend heavily upon avaya s ability to develop its products on a timely basis and compete effectively with other manufacturers products in this market 
from a longer term perspective  we expect the avaya product line to always be a material part of our business and we have no plans to diminish our avaya related efforts in any way 
therefore  we expect to always be dependent to some degree on avaya as a significant supplier of the equipment that we resell 
avaya frequently changes the incentive programs offered to their business partners 
such changes had a detrimental effect on our fiscal results and could do so again in the future 
avaya  like many major manufacturers  provides various financial incentive programs to support the advertising and sale of its products 
we receive substantial rebates through these common incentive programs to offset both costs of goods sold and selling expenses 
we also receive commissions from avaya to sell their maintenance contracts 
these amounts are material to our operating results 
avaya has changed several of these programs in fiscal as a result of these changes  we received less incentive compensation in fiscal than we did in fiscal avaya may change the incentive programs again in fiscal or we may not qualify for incentives at the same level in fiscal as we did in fiscal it is possible that such changes could have a material  adverse impact on our operating results 
if avaya chose to reduce or eliminate its business partner program  our revenues would likely be significantly lower 
revenues earned from customers in which we partner with avaya through its business partner program see marketing under item business  above are a significant portion of our overall revenues 
therefore  our near term financial results are dependent upon avaya continuing this program  and upon our ability to maintain our status with avaya as one of a few favored business partners 
we are investing significant resources to add nortel networks products and services to our product line and our efforts may not produce satisfactory results 
our current nortel networks expertise is isolated in a few individuals 
to extend our market reach and diversify our reliance on avaya  we have added the nortel networks product line to our business 
we are investing significant resources in the hiring and training of personnel to sell  design  install and maintain nortel networks products 
while we believe that revenues derived from the sale of nortel networks systems and services will be a material part of our operating results in the future  it may take longer than we expect or this effort may not be successful at all 
furthermore  our current expertise in nortel networks products is concentrated in a few individuals  the loss of any of which could result in a significant setback in our ability to grow our nortel networks business 

table of contents the introduction of new products could result in reduced revenues  reduced gross margins  reduced customer satisfaction  and longer collection periods 
we are selling a variety of new  highly complex products that incorporate leading edge technology  including both hardware and software 
the early versions of these products  which we are selling currently  can contain software bugs and other defects that can cause the products to not function as intended 
we will likely be dependent upon avaya to fix these problems as they occur 
an inability of avaya to correct these problems quickly could result in damage to our reputation  reduced revenues  reduced customer satisfaction  and delays in payments from customers for products purchased 
we are connecting our products to our customers computer networks and problems with the implementation of these products could cause disruption to our customers entire operations 
unlike traditional  stand alone voice systems  our new products typically are connected to our customers existing local and wide area networks 
while we believe the risk of our products disrupting other traffic or operations on these networks is low  these products are new and unforeseen problems may occur  which could cause significant disruption to our customers operations 
these disruptions  in turn  could result in reduced customer satisfaction  delays in payments from customers for products purchased  damage to our reputation  and even reduced revenues 
we expect our gross margins to vary over time 
our gross margins are impacted by a variety of factors  including changes in customer and product mix  increased price competition  changes in vendor incentive programs  and changes in shipment volume 
we expect these factors to cause our gross margins to be inconsistent as we make quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons 
if our dealer agreements with the original equipment manufacturers are terminated prematurely or unexpectedly  our business could be adversely affected 
we sell communications systems under dealer agreements with avaya  inc  hitachi telecom  usa  inc  and nortel networks 
we are a major dealer for avaya and hitachi and consider our relationship with both to be good 
nevertheless  if our strategic relationship with these manufacturers were to be terminated prematurely or unexpectedly  our operating results would be adversely impacted 
furthermore  these agreements require that we meet certain volume commitments to earn the pricing structure provided in the dealer agreements 
failure to meet these requirements could cause material  adverse consequences to our gross margins and overall operating results 
we are dependent upon a few suppliers 
our growth and ability to meet customer demand also depends in part on our capability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from suppliers 
both avaya and nortel networks utilize a two tier distribution model in which a few third party companies super distributors distribute their products to their respective dealer communities 
in the case of one such distributor  they distribute both avaya and nortel networks products 
the limited amount of distribution available for each of these product lines increases our risks of interruptions in the supply of products in the future 
the success of our business depends significantly upon our ability to retain and recruit highly skilled personnel 
our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled and qualified technical and sales personnel is critical to our success 
competition for such employees in the rapidly changing telecommunications industry is typically intense  although the current economic conditions have temporarily eased some of this pressure 
as we have transformed our company into an integrated communications solutions provider  we have invested heavily the in the hiring and training of personnel to sell and service our new products and service offerings 
if we are unable to retain our skilled employees or to hire additional qualified personnel as needed  it could adversely impact our ability to implement our strategies efficiently and effectively 
we are faced with intense competition and rapidly changing technologies in the industry and market in which we operate 

table of contents the market for our products and services is highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technologies 
as the industry itself evolves and new technologies and products are introduced into the marketplace  new participants enter the market and existing competitors seek to strengthen their positions and expand their product service offerings 
there has been a trend toward industry consolidation  which can lead to the creation of stronger competitors who may be better able to compete as a sole source vendor for customers 
while we believe that through the expansion and transformation of the last few years  we are well positioned to compete effectively in the marketplace  our failure to maintain or enhance this position could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we might have to record a significant goodwill impairment loss in the event our business were to suffer a severe decline 
under sfas  we are required to evaluate the fair value of each of our reporting units annually and determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value of those reporting units  and if so  an impairment loss is recorded in our statement of operations 
the determination of fair value is a highly subjective exercise and can produce very different results based on the assumptions used and methodologies employed 
it is likely that if our financial results were to decline substantially and if macroeconomic conditions eroded  we would have to record a non cash impairment loss in our statement of operations 
the amount of such impairment is impossible to predict  but would likely be very material to our operating results and could represent a significant portion of our shareholders equity 
the successful completion of the upgrade to our technology infrastructure and information systems is critical to our ability to effectively and efficiently operate our business in the future 
also  implementation of the system will significantly increase our depreciation expense 
our success in navigating the current market will depend heavily upon our ability to assemble the necessary information to make informed decisions and implement those decisions quickly and effectively 
for the past months  we have been working on a major upgrade to our technology infrastructure and information systems 
this upgrade will result in a consolidation from four critical legacy systems to one 
due to constraints that we have imposed on capital spending  we have purposely slowed down the development of this system 
furthermore  at our current revenue and activity levels  conversion to this new system is not critical to our near term success 
however  we believe it is prudent to proceed with the conversion while our revenues are at these lower levels in anticipation of future growth 
while we are taking great care to properly plan this implementation and to test the solution fully prior to the conversion  there can be no guarantees given that the conversion will not disrupt our operations 
in addition  at the time we place the new information system into service  we will begin depreciating our investment in the system 
this depreciation will result in a pre tax  non cash charge to our earnings of approximately  per quarter based on the million currently invested in this project 
our targeted operating margins of may not be achievable 
we believe that our current business model would support a target operating margin of 
this target assumes that we can generate significantly higher revenues  maintain our gross margins  and operate our material logistics and general and administrative functions at about the same levels as we currently do 
these assumptions are not tested through past experience operating in the commercial sector of our market and may not be achievable 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
historically  our stock is not widely followed by investment analysts and is subject to price and volume trading volatility 
this volatility is sometimes tied to overall market conditions and may or may not reflect our financial performance 
it is likely that this volatility will continue 
our business is subject to the risks of tornadoes and other natural catastrophic events and to interruptions caused by manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism 
our corporate headquarters and nsc is located in northeastern oklahoma  a region known to be part of tornado alley 
a significant natural disaster  such as a tornado  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
any such event could also cause a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  acts of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military response to this threat  or any future acts 
table of contents of terrorism  may cause further disruption to our economy and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we may be subject to infringement claims and litigation  which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain products and services 
third parties  including customers  may assert claims or initiate legal action against our manufacturers  suppliers  customers or us  alleging that the products we sell infringe on another s proprietary rights 
regardless of the merit of a claim  these types of claims can be time consuming  result in costly litigation  or require us to enter into costly license agreements 
in some instances  a successful claim could prevent us from selling a particular product or service 
we have not conducted patent searches on the third party products we distribute  to independently determine whether they infringe upon another s proprietary rights  nor would it be practical or cost effective for us to do so 
rather  we rely on infringement indemnities given to us by the manufacturers of the equipment we distribute 
however  because these indemnities are not absolute and in some instances have limits of coverage  no assurance can be given that in the event of an infringement claim  our indemnification by the equipment manufacturer will be adequate to hold us harmless or that we will even be entitled to indemnification by the equipment manufacturer 
if any infringement or other intellectual property claim is brought against us and is successful  whether it is based upon a third party manufacturer s equipment that we distribute  or upon our own proprietary products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 
in addition to the specific factors discussed above  we are subject to certain risks that are inherent in doing business  such as general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general economic and political conditions  costs of obtaining insurance  unexpected death of key employees  changes in employment laws and regulations  changes in tax laws and regulations  and other events that can impact revenues and the cost of doing business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
we did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during the fiscal year 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business due to our utilization of variable debt 
our credit facility bears interest at a floating rate at either the london interbank offered rate libor at october  plus to or the bank s prime rate at october  less to 
in an effort to manage the risk associated with variable interest rates  in november we entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with variable rate interest payments  on amortizing notional amounts of million 
at october   the notional amount included under the interest rate swap was million 
the pay fixed rates under the swap agreements are 
the receive floating rates for the swap agreements are month libor  resetting monthly 
the interest rate swaps expire in november variable rate debt outstanding at october   net of the swap agreements was million 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial position or cash flows
