item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  and with the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this form k 
certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the presentation related primarily to the presentation of advertising  circulation and online revenue 
beginning in january  we are reporting our print and online advertising revenue on a combined basis 
accordingly  periods presented in this annual report reflect this reclassification 
the reclassification of circulation revenue pertains to the recording of certain newspaper carrier delivery costs  which in the past were recorded as contra revenue 
this cost has been reclassified to increase other operating costs with a corresponding increase in circulation revenue 
the reclassification was made for the years through glossary of terms the following defined terms are used in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
classified locally placed advertisements listed together and organized by category  such as real estate sales  employment opportunities or automobile sales  and display type advertisements in these same categories

critical accounting policies and estimates general 
management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  cash flows and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to incentives  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing arrangements  restructurings  long term service contracts  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
refer to note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages through for a detailed description of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition varies by source 
advertising revenue is recognized when advertisements are published 
circulation revenue is recognized when the newspaper is delivered to the customer 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
revenue is recorded net of estimated incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowance for bad debts 
we maintain a reserve account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we use a combination of the percentage of sales  specific identification and the aging of accounts receivable methods to establish allowances for losses on accounts receivable 
payment in advance for some advertising and circulation revenue and credit background checks  have assisted us in maintaining historical bad debt losses of less than of revenue 
equity and cost method investment valuation and accounting 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus and we record these investments at cost 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments 
in these cases  an impairment charge could be required in the future 
goodwill and intangible impairment 
we assess  at least annually  potential impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
this asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
this approach uses estimates of future market growth  forecasted revenue and costs and expected periods the assets will be utilized 
such evaluations of impairment of long lived assets including goodwill and purchased intangible assets are an integral part of  but not limited to  our strategic reviews of the business and operations performed in conjunction with restructuring actions 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we also record our share of impairment charges recorded by our equity method investees 
no impairment charges have been recorded to date relating to goodwill and other identified intangibles  except for an impairment recorded in for our equity method investee 
restructuring 
due to the slowing economy and the resulting decline in advertising revenue  we announced a work force reduction program affecting the majority of our newspapers in the second quarter of we eliminated approximately  positions and we recorded a pre tax expense in june of million in reserves in connection with the restructuring 
this expense included estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlement of certain contractual obligations in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
as of june   the plan was substantially complete 
pension and postretirement benefits 
we have significant pension and postretirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
these valuation assumptions include health care cost trend rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical results of the portfolio and management s expectation of the current economic environment 
the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields on aa rated corporate long term bond yields 
actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future life of the plan participants 
for an explanation of these assumptions  see note pension and other postretirement benefit plans on pages through while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect the pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations 
self insurance and deductibles on casualty insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs 
we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
we also have deductibles of up to million on various casualty insurance programs  which we have determined to be adequate for the type of risk 
we continuously review the adequacy of our insurance coverage 
income taxes 
income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas accounting for income taxes 
we file a federal consolidated income tax return and state consolidated  combined or separate returns depending upon state requirements 
each of these filing jurisdictions may audit the tax returns filed and propose adjustments 
we maintain a liability to cover the cost of additional tax exposure items on the filing of federal and state income tax returns 
adjustments arise from a variety of factors  including different interpretation of statutes and regulations 
legal 
we are involved in certain claims and litigation related to our operations  including ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business 
see note commitments and contingencies on pages and for further information 
our management reviews and determines which liabilities  if any  arising from these claims and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  liquidity  results of operations or properties 
management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
determination of the amount of reserves required for these contingencies is made after analysis and discussion with counsel 
commitments and contingencies 
we have ongoing purchase commitments with sp and ponderay  our two newsprint mill partnership investments 
we are committed to purchase at least million and million of newsprint in from sp and ponderay  respectively  at current market prices 
we also have a sales commitment with dn to supply of their newsprint requirements  which in will be approximately million 
we have the resources necessary to fulfill these commitment in business summary we report two operating business segments newspaper and online 
the newspaper segment represented of total operating revenue 
advertising revenue within this segment represented of total operating revenue 
retail  classified and national advertising revenue represented  and  respectively  of total advertising revenue 
circulation revenue comprised of total operating revenue 
for further information  please refer to note business segments under the consolidated financial reports contained in this report 
advertising revenue is primarily determined by the linage  rate and mix of advertisement 
the advertising rate depends largely on our market reach  primarily through circulation  and market dominance 
circulation revenue is based on the number of copies sold and the subscription rate charged to customers 
our overall circulation makes us the second largest newspaper company in the united states 
we operate in several large metropolitan areas  and ours are the dominant newspapers in most of the locations we serve 
for the past three years  our larger markets have been particularly hard hit in the classified employment category  the result of the nationwide downturn in hiring 
unemployment levels of approximately throughout drove the adverse impact philadelphia help wanted was down  kansas city was down and san jose  where the unemployment level fluctuated between and  was down 
all of our other large markets were soft as well  although fort worth turned sharply positive in the fourth quarter 
with the national economy showing increasing strength  we are projecting a modest increase for the coming year in this category 
our retail category increased last year on the strength of office supplies  home improvement  drugstores and general merchandise  as well as a increase in preprint revenue  on a volume increase 
however  the department store category was soft and after a good start early in the year  advertising from department stores began to decline 
traditional department stores  like macy s and dillard s face strong competition from stores like wal mart and costco and they are working hard to realign and redefine their business strategies 
national advertising showed the strongest percentage growth year over year  at  with increases in all four quarters 
advertisers recognize that newspapers  unlike television and radio  remain a genuine mass medium and are more responsive and flexible to their needs 
although we continue to expand our core revenue sources  we launched a revenue task force in to identify new sources of revenue 
we are now implementing those initiatives that best fit our strategy and have the highest return 
our target for the coming year is million 
we are optimistic that the number is achievable 
we will focus on the following areas national  automotive and help wanted  sales force staffing  paid content  niche publications  retail majors and rop zoning 
we also have established a national marketing group in response to the rapidly evolving retail and national environments 
for total classified and for total advertising revenue  we are projecting an increase in the mid single digits 
in recent years  many newspapers nationwide have experienced declines in circulation copies and revenue 
increased competition  particularly from the internet  has caused the decline in copies 
we have increased discounting as a primary tactic to grow circulation  which caused our revenue to decline 
over the past two years we have increased our circulation in  excluding detroit and fort wayne  where we have joint operating agreements  nevertheless  growing both circulation copies and growing revenue remains a challenge to our industry and us 
our plans for the coming year include telemarketing and selective discounting  along with increased use of crew sales  kiosks  single copy insert coupons and direct mail promotions 
recently enacted telemarketing rules adopted by the federal trade commission and federal communications commission  including the national do not call registry and regulations will have an impact on our ability to source subscriptions through telemarketing  but we have yet to determine the extent 
there are two favorable factors a not everyone will elect to be included on the register  and b our newspapers will still be able to contact persons with whom they have an established business relationship or from whom they obtained express consent 
in response to the economic downturn  newspapers have focused attention on cost reduction 
in  we implemented a work force reduction program 
in  we launched an operations task force to identify savings that could be applied companywide 
the task force teams investigated opportunities in content  production  technology  people  administration  vendor management  smaller papers and circulation 
we began implementing their recommendations in in total  we anticipate incremental savings of more than million in in  overall costs were up just  despite a rise in newsprint costs and a increase in benefits costs 
ftes were down in  following declines of and in and  respectively 
for the coming year  we anticipate increases in newsprint and benefits primarily pension and postretirement benefits in the low double digits and mid single digits  respectively 
however  due to certain cost efficiencies  we expect the newsprint  ink and supplements line to only increase in the high single digits 
ftes should be down another  with the core down but with another added back for various revenue task force initiatives 
our online segment performed very well in revenue of million was up and operating income of million compared with a loss of million the previous year 
krd unique visitors averaged million per month  up 
the strong results reflect increases in all of krd s revenue streams 
krd management is focused on growing revenue  managing costs  and increasing unique visitors 
the team is also focused on maximizing the benefit of the recent aol and msn traffic agreements with careerbuilder 
we project a solid trajectory of growth for this segment in our net income and diluted earnings per share are further determined by the level of interest expense  losses from investees  effective tax rate and the number of shares repurchased net of the shares issued pursuant to stock option and purchase plans 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our overall interest cost 
our average cost of debt  including the benefit of swaps  was at the end of fiscal in  we used million of our excess cash to pay down debt 
in addition to historically low interest rates during  debt reductions over the past few years have helped reduce interest expense 
losses from investees declined over the past year and we expect further improvement in as the price per ton of newsprint is projected to increase  benefiting our newsprint mill investees 
our effective tax rate was lower in than in  mainly due to favorable tax settlements during the year 
we anticipate the effective tax rate to be in  and we continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our income tax expense 
our shares outstanding decreased in  the result of our continued commitment to eliminate dilution from employees stock option and purchase plans  and to allocate free cash flow to share repurchases 
our businesses continue to provide sufficient cash for our operations and capital expenditures 
moreover  we intend to use future cash flow for the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares  as well as strategic acquisitions 
consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended december   december   and december  our fiscal year ends on the last sunday of the calendar year 
results for  and are for the weeks ended december  december and december  respectively 
the following tables set forth the consolidated results of operations for the periods ended december   december  and december  in thousands  except per share data change operating revenue operating income net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of unconsolidated company cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of unconsolidated company net income net income includes the following expenses cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of unconsolidated company careerbuilder llc conversion goodwill and other identified intangibles amortization losses on investments work force reduction diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of unconsolidated company cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of unconsolidated company diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share includes the following expenses cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of unconsolidated company careerbuilder llc conversion goodwill and other identified intangibles amortization losses on investments work force reduction percent not meaningful diluted earnings per share for included charges of per share for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of career holdings  an equity method investee  related to its adoption of sfas and per share for the conversion of career holdings  inc  from a c corporation to a limited liability company llc 
diluted earnings per share for included goodwill and other identified intangibles amortization of per share  work force reduction charges of per share and losses on investments of per share 
the increase in diluted earnings per share in was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average number of shares outstanding and the absence of the careerbuilder charge in the current year 
a million increase in operating revenue was offset by a million increase in operating costs  primarily related to higher employee benefit costs and newsprint expense 
earnings benefited by a million decrease in net interest expense and a million decrease in losses from equity investments 
a lower effective tax rate for the year versus the prior year also positively affected earnings per share 
excluding the unusual items identified above  our diluted earnings per share increased from to a decrease in newsprint  ink and supplements was offset by a decrease in classified revenue  resulting in a increase year over year in operating income 
a decrease in net interest expense  a lower effective tax rate and a decline in the weighted average number of shares outstanding positively affected earnings per share 
partially offsetting these favorable items was an increase in losses from investees 
newspaper division operating revenue 
the following table summarizes the results of the newspaper division for the fiscal years ended december   december   and december  in thousands change operating revenue advertising retail national classified total circulation other total operating revenue average circulation daily sunday advertising linage full run retail national classified total total advertising revenue for was higher than for a increase in retail revenue and a increase in national revenue were largely offset by a decline in classified revenue 
total advertising revenue declined for the year ended december  compared with the same period in due to an decrease in classified revenue  partially offset by a increase in retail revenue and a increase in national revenue 
retail revenue increased from to due to a increase in preprint revenue and a increase in the full run rop average rate  partially offset by a decrease in the full run average linage 
specialized publications revenue  up  and tmc revenue  up  also contributed to the increase in retail revenue 
miami  kansas city  columbia and biloxi were responsible for most of the increase  up   and  respectively 
compared with  retail advertising revenue in increased due to a full run rop linage increase  an increase in preprint and a increase in tmc revenue  partially offset by a decrease in the full run rop average rate 
miami  contra costa  philadelphia and san jose were responsible for most of the increase  up   and  respectively 
national revenue increased mostly in akron  charlotte  contra costa  fort worth  philadelphia and san jose in compared with the same period in  up     and  respectively 
a increase in full run rop linage along with a increase in preprint revenue drove the increase over telecommunications was largely responsible for the increase  with additional support from travel  automotive and financial 
national advertising revenue increased in from due to a increase in the full run rop average rate and a increase in tmc revenue  partially offset by a decrease in full run rop linage 
miami and kansas city had the largest increases  up and  respectively 
classified revenue continued declining in compared to  but at a reduced rate than in compared to there was a decline in the full run rop average rate  driven largely by declines in employment revenue 
the decline in the full run rop rate was partially offset by an increase in part run linage 
declines in classified recruitment in our largest markets drove the overall decline with san jose  contra costa  kansas city  saint paul and philadelphia  down    and  respectively  compared with significant declines in classified other revenue in san jose  kansas city  charlotte and fort worth down   and  respectively  partially offset a increase in miami and also served to reduce classified revenues in overall  classified automotive declined by compared with and classified real estate increased by 
classified advertising revenue decreased in from due to a full run rop average rate decrease of  driven by declines in the recruitment category  partially offset by a increase in full run rop linage 
as in  declines in classified recruitment in our largest markets were responsible  with san jose down and philadelphia down 
the automotive  real estate and other categories increased 
during  we expect advertising revenue to grow in the mid single digits  with half of this increase coming from core business and the other half from new initiatives 
we expect national and classified revenue to be somewhat stronger than retail revenue 
retail revenue is generally healthy  with the exception of department stores 
national revenue continues to be solid 
classified revenue assumes some comeback in auto revenue and sustained strength in real estate revenue  but with only a modest increase in employment revenue 
this outlook reflects both current economic indicators and our inclination to be conservative  even in the face of positive signals 
circulation revenue declined by in compared with largely due to a reduction in the average rate resulting from increased discounts on subscription rates 
including detroit and fort wayne  circulation copies decreased daily and for sunday 
circulation copies increased in all but one of our major markets for both daily and sunday papers 
circulation revenue decreased in from due to increased discounting and price rollbacks  primarily confined to sunday single copy in five markets 
circulation copies were flat both daily and sunday 
increases in philadelphia  fort worth and bradenton were offset by decreases in kansas city  columbus and charlotte 
from to  other revenue increased by as a result of significant increases in commercial printing  alternate distribution and miscellaneous revenue 
other revenue increased in from due to an increase in earnings from detroit  partially offset by decreases in commercial printing  specialized publications and event marketing revenue 
operating costs 
the following table summarizes operating costs for the periods ended december   december   and december  in thousands change operating costs labor and employee benefits newsprint  ink and supplements other operating costs depreciation and amortization total operating costs labor and employee benefits increased in compared with a increase in the average wage rate per employee was partially offset by a reduction in ftes 
in addition  employee benefits increased by due to a million favorable adjustment to postretirement benefit expenses in philadelphia related to a structural change in the guild s severance plan read below for a more detailed explanation 
pension costs increased by million and health insurance expenses increased by million 
the increase in pension cost was due to declines in market value of pension plan assets 
moreover  health care insurance costs continue to increase even as our employees contribute greater amounts to offset those costs 
during  we expect to hold health care costs flat  while we anticipate an increase in pension costs due to the lower return on asset assumption from to and a lower discount rate 
labor and employee benefits decreased in from  primarily due to a restructuring charge related to a work force reduction in due to the slowing economy and the resulting decline in advertising revenue in the second quarter of  we announced a work force reduction program that affected the majority of our newspapers 
the work force reduction plan eliminated approximately  positions through early retirement  voluntary and involuntary buyouts and attrition 
as a result  we incurred pre tax charges of approximately million related to employee severance costs and benefits during excluding this work force reduction charge in  labor and employee benefits increased 
the increase was a result of higher health insurance costs  bonuses and incentive costs in and a increase in the average wage rate per employee  partially offset by a decrease in the number of ftes 
in december  philadelphia transferred certain severance obligations previously accounted for as postretirement benefits under a company sponsored plan to a multi employer plan 
an employer participating in a multi employer plan recognizes the required contribution each period as pension expense 
accordingly  upon the transfer  a gain of million was recognized  consisting of the previously recorded million postretirement obligation at the date of transfer  net of a required million contribution 
newsprint  ink and supplements expense increased in compared with this increase was driven largely by a increase in the average cost per ton of newsprint  an increase in consumption of and higher costs of ink and supplements of 
the decrease in from resulted from a decline in the average cost per ton of newsprint  a decline in the cost of ink and supplements and a decrease in consumption 
the decline in newsprint consumption was due primarily to decreases in classified employment advertising linage and commercial printing  and a decrease in the web width of some newspapers 
during  we expect the price of newsprint to rise in the low double digits  but  due to certain cost efficiencies  we expect the newsprint  ink and supplements line will increase only in the high single digits 
other operating costs decreased in when compared with this decrease was driven by reductions in professional fees  office supplies  communication costs and bad debt expenses 
other operating costs increased by in from depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared with due to lower levels of capital spending in recent years 
sfas was adopted at the beginning of and resulted in a decrease of in depreciation and amortization expense for the year compared to no longer amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles caused an increase in operating income of million and an increase in net income of million  or 
per share  in excluding the effect from the adoption of sfas  depreciation and amortization expense decreased 
online division online activities 
during the first quarter of  we consolidated all of our internet operations under a wholly owned subsidiary  knight ridder digital krd 
previously  our internet activities were reported and managed as a part of our newspaper operations 
krd coordinates all of our online efforts  including the web sites previously operated by the newspapers 
krd operates and manages the real cities network  which consists of all knight ridder web sites and those of several media affiliates 
operating revenue and costs 
the following table summarizes operating revenue and costs for the periods ended december   december  and december  in thousands change operating revenue advertising retail national classified total other total operating revenue operating costs labor and employee benefits other operating costs depreciation and amortization total operating costs operating income loss average monthly unique visitors percent not meaningful revenue for the online division was up in compared with  driven largely by increases in all upsell revenue categories  resulting from the implementation of a new upsell strategy and launching of retail upsell packages in revenue in compared with was up  driven by increases in recruitment packages  recruitment and other upsell and content syndication 
reach for krd properties  defined as the percentage of all online users in the nation who used any of krd s web sites  increased from in to in and to in average monthly unique visitors increased from million in to million in and to million in our audience grew by in our top markets in and by in all of our markets compared with 
the growth resulted from enhancements to our local web sites  making them more user friendly to our advertisers and readers  highly valuable and frequently updated content coupled with increased visibility of our sites in web search engines  and strategies that combined ads in print with online ads drawing people to classifieds and other areas of our sites 
the cost of labor and employee benefits decreased by in compared with  driven largely by a reduction in ftes 
labor and employee benefits expenses declined in from due to a reduction in ftes 
other operating costs increased in compared with as a result of purchasing a new order entry system  fees for sales and technology consultants and other professional fees and software license expenses 
in other operating costs decreased from due to focused efforts to achieve significant reductions in hosting service costs  content and wire service costs  promotion related expenses and other administrative costs 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in is the result of write offs of certain assets  including a significant amount of outdated software  in the second half of depreciation and amortization expense increased in from due to the launch in early of a single digital platform a shared content management and web serving database for all of the krd web sites and the costs associated with the new krd offices 
corporate and other non operating items interest expense decreased million  or  in compared with and by million  or  in from the decrease in each year was due primarily to lower weighted average interest rates and a decline in the average debt balance 
during and interest rates were at historically low levels and it is anticipated that as the us economy improves  interest rates will increase  resulting in higher interest expense in the future 
capitalized interest expense  which reduced net interest expense for the year  increased by million in over due largely to the construction of our new kansas city production plant 
for the year  losses from equity investments declined to million from million in the improved results in are attributable to an million reduction in losses from our newsprint mill investments stemming from the increase in the cost per ton of newsprint that began in the latter part of in addition  our loss from our equity investment in careerbuilder declined by million as one time charges  described below for  did not recur in the seattle times also added to the losses from equity investments in  offset somewhat by income from classified ventures and knight ridder tribune information services 
in  losses from equity investments rose to million from million in  an increase of million 
this was the result of one time charges totaling million explained below and a decline of million from our newsprint mill investments  reflecting the substantial decline in the price of newsprint in from these one time charges in related to our investment in careerbuilder llc 
they were a a million charge in the first quarter for severance expense and other costs resulting from the relocation of offices and abandonment of certain assets  and b an million charge 
per share after tax associated with the conversion of careerbuilder from a corporation into a limited liability company 
the conversion resulted in a taxable gain to careerbuilder to the extent the fair value of its assets was greater than the tax basis on the date of the conversion 
there was no gain recognized for financial accounting purposes upon this conversion 
accordingly  careerbuilder recorded a tax expense and paid taxes of approximately million 
we recorded our share of this expense as part of the loss from equity investments 
careerbuilder s conversion to an llc also triggered the recognition of a tax loss in since the acquisition of our interest in careerbuilder  we had recorded tax benefits in the form of deferred taxes for our share of the losses arising from careerbuilder s operating results 
the conversion allowed us to recognize these losses for income tax purposes as the conversion was treated as a sale of the stock of careerbuilder for its fair market value 
this capital loss was carried back and applied against taxes paid in prior years 
we received a tax refund of million related to the loss carry back claim 
because we had previously recorded the losses for financial statement reporting  the recognition of the tax loss did not affect our results of operations 
following the conversion to an llc  our share of careerbuilder s operating results is included in our consolidated tax returns 
unlike c corporations  which are separate entities subject to income tax  llcs generally are not taxable entities  and their operating results are included in those of its members 
in  unfavorable non operating items were slightly offset by an increase in earnings of the seattle times company and the ongoing operations of careerbuilder 
acquisitions and dispositions in the first quarter of  we sold our holdings in infospace  inc  at t  webvan group  inc 
and other smaller internet related investments  realizing an aggregate pre tax loss of approximately million 
additionally  we recorded other than temporary declines in a number of other cost basis internet related investments of million in in november  careerbuilder acquired headhunter 
net  an online recruitment and career development business  for per share in cash  or approximately million 
the acquisition was funded by capital contributions from both knight ridder and tribune co 
our share was million 
on october   we and tribune co 
each sold one third of our respective interest in careerbuilder to gannett co 
inc  for million 
our share of the proceeds was approximately million 
the sale price was equal to our carrying value and no gain or loss was recorded on the sale 
we currently own a interest in careerbuilder  through krd 
on january   we sold our stock in matchnet plc  realizing proceeds of  and recording an aggregate pre tax loss of approximately million 
additionally  we recorded other than temporary declines in a number of other cost basis internet related investments of million in as of december   the carrying value of the remaining cost basis investments was million 
on march   we sold our one third share of infinet company to gannett co 
inc  for approximately million  and recorded a million pre tax gain on the sale 
on may   we amended our agreement with the journal gazette company to extend our joint operating agreement in fort wayne  indiana  to the year under the amended terms  we increased our partnership interest from to 
the joint operating agreement governs the partnership and operation of fort wayne newspapers  the agency that handles advertising sales  printing  distribution and administration of the two daily newspapers 
the transaction resulted in a million increase in our goodwill balance on the consolidated balance sheet 
liquidity and capital resources cash was million at december   compared with million at december  during  cash flows from operating activities were used to fund treasury stock purchases of million  common stock dividends of million and debt reduction of million 
during  cash flows from operating activities were used to fund treasury stock purchases of million and pay dividends of million and to reduce debt by million 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with million in the increase was due to lower cash contributions in excess of pension and other retirement benefit plan expenses  increases in federal and state income taxes payable and higher net income  partially offset by decreases in provisions for deferred taxes and lower distributions in excess of losses from investees

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk borrowings 
by balancing the mix of variable versus fixed rate borrowings  we manage the interest rate risk of our debt 
note debt on pages and of this report includes information related to the contractual interest rates and fair value of the individual borrowings 
at various times  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate exposure in order to achieve a desired proportion of variable rate versus fixed rate debt 
the fair value of the swaps at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
as of the end of  approximately of our borrowings were variable rate 
on january   we entered into additional interest rate swap agreements  increasing our percentage of variable rate borrowings to over 
we do not trade or engage in hedging for speculative purposes and hedging activities are transacted only with highly rated financial institutions  reducing the exposure to credit risk 
a hypothetical basis point increase in libor would increase interest expense associated with variable rate borrowings by approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis points increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps by million in this change in fair value of debt obligations excludes commercial paper and other short term variable rate borrowings as changes in interest rates would not significantly affect the fair market value of these instruments 
newsprint 
we consumed approximately  metric tons of newsprint in  excluding detroit 
this represented of our total operating expenses 
under the caption newsprint on page of this report  we have included information on our suppliers  the long term purchase agreements used to manage the related risk of price increases  and natural hedges we have in place through our investment in newsprint mills 
a hypothetical increase in newsprint costs would increase newsprint expense by approximately million 
our ownership in sp and ponderay provide a hedge against price volatility for approximately of our newsprint expense 
this million increase in newsprint costs would be partially offset by million in earnings from our newsprint mill investments  and would increase our earnings from equity investees on our consolidated statement of income 
therefore  our pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million 
effect of inflation and changing prices the consumer price index  a widely used measure of the impact of changing prices  has increased only moderately in recent years  up between and each year since although inflation has slowed in recent years  it is still a factor in our economy and we continue to seek ways to mitigate its impact 
moreover  over the past two years we have experienced significant increases in our benefits expense  the result of increases in pension and health care costs 
newsprint expense increased in over the previous year and is projected to increase in the low double digits in due to intense competition in recent years  we have been unable to pass cost increases on to our advertising and circulation customers 
therefore  we have focused our efforts on reducing  eliminating and managing our costs better  and on finding new alternative sources of revenue
