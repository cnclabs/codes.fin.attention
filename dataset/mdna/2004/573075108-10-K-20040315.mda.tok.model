item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our services 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  and other accessorial services 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the united states economy  inventory levels  the level of truck capacity in the temperature sensitive market  and specific customer demand 
we monitor our revenue production primarily through revenue per tractor per week 
we also analyze our rates per total and loaded miles  non revenue miles percentage  and the miles per tractor we generate 
our operating results reflect improved freight demand during the course of the year  coupled with our continuing emphasis on asset productivity  operating efficiency and cost control 
increased freight demand reflected a healthy interaction between modestly improved economic conditions and our strategic emphasis on high levels of service and freight capacity 
in  we increased our operating revenue and our freight revenue operating revenue less fuel surcharge revenue 
we were able to increase our revenue by increasing our business with existing and new customers  increasing the size of our fleet  operating our fleet more efficiently  and increasing our freight rates 
fourteen of our largest accounts increased their business with us by more than million each in we increased our average operating revenue per tractor per week in  and our average freight revenue per tractor per week  reflecting improvements in both average miles per tractor and in average freight revenue per mile 
in  we plan to continue to seek appropriate rate increases  and we expect freight demand to remain strong  reflecting at least modest economic growth 
we expect the majority of our growth in to continue to come from our large customers  which increasingly are looking to carriers that offer superior service  capacity and financial stability 
the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which are recorded under purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and financing of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and operating terminals 
although many of these factors are beyond our control  we monitor these factors closely and attempt to anticipate changes in these factors in managing our business 
for example  our average fuel prices were per gallon in  per gallon in and per gallon in in addition  fuel prices fluctuated dramatically and quickly at various times during the last three years 
we manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices primarily through fuel surcharge programs with our customers 
like other companies in our industry  our insurance costs have increased dramatically over the last few years 
in order to control increases in insurance premiums  we increased the self insured retention limit for our primary accident insurance from  in to million in we have maintained these self insured retention levels for although we have controlled increases in our premium costs  we are exposed to additional risk 
additionally  we operate in a highly competitive and regulated industry that is currently responding to significant regulatory changes regarding drivers hours of service and emissions controls on diesel engines 
although it is still too early to ascertain how the new hours of service requirements and emissions controls on diesel engines will affect our business  based on our initial experience  our preliminary expectation is that the rules will not significantly disrupt our operations or materially affect our results of operations 
by increasing our fleet and operating our fleet more efficiently  while controlling expenses  we improved our operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue to in from in  and increased our earnings per diluted share  to in from in  on an increase in weighted average shares outstanding 
our goal is to maintain our operating ratio at or below this level during we expect this to require additional improvements in revenue per tractor per week to overcome expected additional cost increases of new equipment  elevated insurance costs and other general increases in operating costs 
our business requires substantial  ongoing capital investments  particularly for new tractors and trailers 
in and  we were able to fund our capital expenditure requirements and significantly reduce our outstanding indebtedness as our net cash provided by operating activities exceeded our capital expenditure requirements net of proceeds received on dispositions 
at december   we had approximately million of marketable securities  million of long term debt  and million in stockholder s equity 
we estimate that capital expenditures  net of trade ins  will be approximately million for  primarily for new revenue equipment 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures with cash flows from operations  our investment in marketable securities  and  if necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
stock issuance we issued million shares of our common stock in a public offering completed during the third quarter of the stock issuance resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
we used a portion of our net proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the balance of our net proceeds is being used for general corporate purposes  including the purchase of tractors and trailers 
stock splits on july   we effected a three for two stock split in the form of a stock dividend 
on december   we effected a second three for two stock split in the form of a stock dividend 
our financial statements  related notes  and other financial data contained in this report have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock splits for all periods presented 
discussion of freight revenue in discussing our results of operations  we have included in certain instances a discussion of revenue  before fuel surcharge  or freight revenue  and certain expenses  net of fuel surcharge 
we do this because we believe that eliminating this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss in certain instances the changes in our expenses as a percentage of both operating and freight revenue  as well as in absolute dollars 
we do this because most of our expenses are variable and increase or decrease with the size of our company owned tractor fleet and the miles that we operate 
accordingly  we believe such a discussion is more useful to understanding the changes in profitability in our business

our weighted average number of tractors increased from to our average operating revenue per tractor per week increased from to our average freight revenue per tractor per week increased from to  due to a increase in average miles per tractor combined with a increase in average freight revenue per mile 
salaries  wages and benefits consist of compensation for our employees  including both driver and non driver employees  employees health insurance  k plan contributions  and other fringe benefits 
these expenses will vary depending upon the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors  our efficiency  our experience with employees health insurance claims  and changes in health care premiums 
salaries  wages and benefits increased million  or  from to in  salaries  wages and benefits decreased as a percentage of operating revenue but increased as a percentage of freight revenue 
the increase in salaries  wages and benefits resulted primarily from the increase in the size of our fleet and million of additional compensation earned by our non driver employees under our incentive compensation program in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our employees health insurance expense due to a decrease in the estimated costs of our self insured medical claims of  primarily caused by an increase in the participants deductible levels  from to  and a planned reduction in our student driver training expense from purchased transportation consists of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment 
this category will vary depending upon the ratio of company drivers versus independent contractors and the amount of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors 
purchased transportation increased million  or  from to the increase in purchased transportation was due to a million increase in fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors and an increase in the average number of independent contractors from as a percentage of operating revenue  purchased transportation decreased from in to in as a percentage of freight revenue  purchased transportation net of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors  decreased from in to in  primarily because of a decrease in the percentage of independent contractor owned tractors in our fleet 
fuel and fuel taxes  which we refer to as fuel expense  increased million  or  from to as a percentage of operating revenue  fuel expense increased from in to in fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million in and million in  increased million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of freight revenue  fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenue  increased from in to in this slight percentage increase is a reflection of our ability to manage fuel price increases through our fuel surcharge program 
our fuel prices increased  from an average of per gallon in to an average of per gallon in fuel surcharges amounted to per total mile in compared with per total mile in fuel prices increased sharply during the first three months of because of reasons such as unrest in venezuela and the middle east and low inventories 
although fuel prices have moderated somewhat  they remain high based on historical standards 
we have fuel surcharge provisions in substantially all of our transportation contracts and attempt to recover these increased expenses through fuel surcharges and higher rates 
we believe our fuel surcharge program helps offset a substantial portion of increases in fuel costs 
however  fuel price increases are not fully offset through these measures  and we do not have surcharge protection on non revenue miles or the fuel used in our refrigeration units 
we expect our fuel costs to increase in the future because we believe that government mandated emissions standards  which became effective october   will result in less fuel efficient engines 
supplies and maintenance consist of repairs  maintenance  tires  parts  oil  and engine fluids and vary with the age of equipment and the amount of usage 
supplies and maintenance increased million  or  from to this increase resulted from our larger fleet and the higher percentage of company owned tractors in our fleet  for which we bear all maintenance expenses 
we did not change our maintenance policy and our tractor and trailer fleets remained approximately the same ages 
depreciation relates to owned tractors  trailers  communications units  and terminal facilities 
gains or losses on dispositions of revenue equipment are set forth in a separate line item  rather than included in this category 
depreciation increased million  or  from to depreciation decreased as a percentage of operating and freight revenue from to  primarily because our trailer to tractor ratio decreased and higher freight revenue per tractor more efficiently spread this fixed cost 
this more than offset an increase in the relative percentage of company owned vehicles to independent contractor vehicles 
our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership may increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment  which would result in greater depreciation over the useful life 
insurance and claims consist of the costs of insurance premiums and the accruals we make for claims within our self insured retention amounts  primarily for personal injury  property damage  physical damage to our equipment  cargo claims  and workers compensation claims 
these expenses will vary primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience  our self insured retention levels  and the market for insurance 
insurance and claims increased  or  from to a  increase in insurance premiums was partially offset by a  decrease in the cost of accident and cargo claims 
as a percentage of operating revenue  insurance and claims decreased from in to in we increased the self insured retention limit for our primary accident insurance from  in to million in we have maintained these self insured retention levels for our significant self insured retention exposes us to the possibility of significant fluctuations in claims expense between periods depending on the frequency  severity  and timing of claims and to adverse financial results if we incur large or numerous losses 
in the event of an uninsured claim above our insurance coverage  or an increase in the frequency or severity of claims within our self insured retention  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in  the market value for used tractors improved while the market value for used trailers was consistent with as a result  our gain on disposition of revenue equipment increased to  in we incurred a loss of  on disposition of revenue equipment in other expense includes professional fees  driver recruiting and retention costs  trailer and drop yard rental  and other miscellaneous expenses 
other expense decreased  or  from to the decrease in other expense was primarily due to the reversal of a  accrual  which was primarily established in  for a state sales tax claim dismissed during the third quarter of excluding the effect of the accrual and related reversal  other expense in was consistent with as a result of the foregoing factors  we improved our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  or operating ratio  from in to in we improved our operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenue  as a percentage of freight revenue from in to in interest expense consists of interest expense on our revolving credit facility and senior unsecured notes 
these expenses are partially offset by interest income from the financing we provide to independent contractors under our tractor purchase program and from our investment in short term marketable securities 
interest expense  net  decreased  or  from to this decrease was primarily the result of lower average debt balances outstanding during the second half of  including the repayment of the outstanding balance due under our revolving credit facility  an increase in interest income from financing provided to independent contractors and earnings from short term marketable securities 
our effective income tax rate was in each of and we currently apply a rate when recording federal deferred taxes  however  we will evaluate our income tax rate for recording federal deferred income taxes in the future given the possibility of an increase in our statutory federal income tax rate based upon projected future earnings and capital expenditures 
if required  a increase in our deferred income tax rate would result in an increase in our deferred tax liability and a reduction in our earnings of approximately million in the year in which the change in rates is applied 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased  from million in to million in net earnings per share improved from per diluted share in to per diluted share in on an increase in weighted average shares attributable primarily to our public offering of common stock completed during the third quarter of comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  the following table sets forth the dollar and percentage increase or decrease of the items in our statements of operations to from  and those items as a percentage of operating and freight revenue dollar change percentage change percentage of operating revenue percentage of freight revenue dollars in thousands vs

off balance sheet arrangements we currently account for our equity investment in mwl using the equity method of accounting 
we are continuing our evaluation of the applicability of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised  to this investment 
while the ultimate treatment of this investment under fin no 
 as revised  is not yet determined  it is likely that we will consolidate mwl during the three month period ending march  we did not have any other material off balance sheet arrangements during the three years ended december  inflation and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices  accident claims  health insurance  and employee compensation 
we attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect our profitability 
we require substantial amounts of fuel to operate our tractors and power the temperature control units on our trailers 
substantially all of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although we historically have been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  increases usually are not fully recovered 
fuel prices have remained high throughout most of and in  which has increased our cost of operating 
the elevated level of fuel prices is expected to continue in seasonality our tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency  increased claims  and more equipment repairs 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
insurance and claims 
we self insure  in part  for losses relating to workers compensation  auto liability  general liability  cargo and property damage claims  along with employees health insurance with varying risk retention levels 
we maintain insurance coverage for per incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review 
however  we could suffer losses over our policy limits  which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 
on january   we increased our self insured retention limit for auto liability claims from  to million per incident and on workers compensation claims from  to  per incident 
we have maintained these self insured retention levels for we have million in letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities 
the insurance and claims accruals in our balance sheets were million as of december   and million as of december  we reserve currently for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
we periodically evaluate and adjust these reserves based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of outstanding individual claims and our estimate of future claims development based on historical claims development factors 
we believe that our claims development factors have historically been reasonable  as indicated by the adequacy of our insurance and claims accruals compared to settled claims 
actual results could differ from these current estimates 
if our claims settlement experience worsened causing our historical claims development factors to increase by  our estimated outstanding loss reserves as of december  would have needed to increase by approximately million 
property and equipment 
the transportation industry requires significant capital investments 
our net property and equipment was million as of december  and million as of december  our depreciation expense was million for  million for and million for we compute depreciation of our property and equipment for financial reporting purposes based on the cost of each asset  reduced by its estimated salvage value  using the straight line method over its estimated useful life 
we determine and periodically evaluate our estimate of the projected salvage values and useful lives primarily by considering the market for used equipment  prior useful lives  and changes in technology 
we have not changed our policy regarding salvage values as a percentage of initial cost or useful lives of tractors and trailers for more than six years 
we believe that our policies and past estimates have been reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a decrease in estimated salvage values would have decreased our net property and equipment as of december  by approximately million  or 
impairment of assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
 as revised  requires an entity to consolidate a variable interest entity if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the entity does not have a majority of voting interests 
a variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity where its equity is unable to finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risk and rewards of ownership 
the provisions of this interpretation must be applied at the beginning of the first interim or annual period ending after march  we own a equity interest in mwl  for which we paid  in mwl is a third party provider of logistics services to the transportation industry with approximately million of revenue in and total assets of approximately million as of december  we received million of our revenue from transportation services arranged by mwl in  making mwl our fifth largest customer 
we also had a trade receivable in the amount of million from mwl at december  in addition  we have committed to provide revolving loans to mwl in the maximum outstanding amount of million 
as of december   we owed mwl  under this credit arrangement due to loan prepayments made prior to december  our exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with mwl is not significant as our investment has been reduced to zero 
we currently account for our investment in mwl using the equity method of accounting 
we are continuing our evaluation of the applicability of fin no 
 as revised  to this investment 
while the ultimate treatment of this investment under fin no 
 as revised  is not yet determined  it is likely that we will consolidate mwl during the three month period ending march  forward looking statements and risk factors this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements 
such statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of any statements not of historical fact may be considered forward looking statements 
written words such as may  expect  believe  anticipate or estimate  or other variations of these or similar words  identify such statements 
these statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially  depending on a variety of factors and risks  including but not limited to those discussed below 
our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on the results of our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  excess capacity in the trucking industry  strikes or other work stoppages  surpluses in the market for used equipment  interest rates  fuel taxes  license and registration fees  insurance premiums  self insurance levels  and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors 
we also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
it is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks and subsequent events on the economy or on consumer confidence in the united states  or the impact  if any  on our future results of operations 
in addition  our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry  and numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability 
we compete with many other truckload carriers that provide temperature sensitive service of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with less than truckload carriers  railroads  and other transportation companies  many of which have more equipment  a wider range of services  and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages 
in particular  several of the largest truckload carriers that offer primarily dry van service also offer temperature sensitive service  and these carriers could attempt to increase their business in the temperature sensitive market 
many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain significant growth in our business 
in addition  many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved service providers  or conduct bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and in some instances we may not be selected as a core carrier or to provide service under such bids 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from our major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers 
for  our top customers  based on revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue  our top ten customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  our top five customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  and our top two customers accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we do not expect these percentages to change materially for generally  we enter into one year contracts with our major customers  the majority of which do not contain any firm obligations to ship with us 
we cannot assure you that  upon expiration of existing contracts  these customers will continue to use our services or that  if they do  they will continue at the same levels 
in addition  our volumes and rates with our customers could decrease as a result of bid processes or other factors 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly affect our earnings 
our future insurance and claims expense might exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
we self insure for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from workers compensation  auto liability  general liability  cargo and property damage claims  as well as employees health insurance 
we also are responsible for our legal expenses relating to such claims 
we reserve currently for anticipated losses and expenses 
we periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience 
however  ultimate results may differ from our estimates  which could result in losses over our reserved amounts 
on january   we increased our self insured retention limit for auto liability claims from  to million per incident and for workers compensation claims from  to  per incident 
we have maintained these self insured retention levels for the increase in self insured retention could increase our claims expense or make our claims expense more volatile depending on the frequency  severity  and timing of claims 
accordingly  the number or severity of claims for which we are self insured  or the timing of such claims within a given period  could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self insure with licensed insurance carriers 
although we believe the aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims  it is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits 
insurance carriers recently have been raising premiums for many businesses  including trucking companies 
as a result  our insurance and claims expense could increase  or we could raise our self insured retention when our policies are renewed 
if these expenses increase  or if we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits  or we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided  results of our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
increases in compensation or difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 
periodically  the transportation industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors  and competition for drivers is intense 
due in part to current economic conditions  including the cost of fuel and insurance  the available pool of independent contractor drivers is smaller than it has been historically 
accordingly  we may face difficulty increasing the number of our independent contractor drivers  which is one of our principal sources of planned growth 
in addition  our industry suffers from high turnover rates of drivers 
our turnover rate requires us to recruit a substantial number of drivers 
moreover  our turnover rate could increase 
if we are unable to continue to attract drivers and contract with independent contractors  we could be required to adjust our driver compensation package or let trucks sit idle 
in addition  our compensation of drivers and independent contractors is subject to market forces  and we may increase their compensation in future periods 
an increase in our expenses or in the number of tractors without drivers could materially and adversely affect our growth and profitability 
fluctuations in the price or availability of fuel may increase our cost of operation  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
we require large amounts of diesel fuel to operate our tractors and to power the temperature control units on our trailers 
fuel is one of our largest operating expenses 
fuel prices tend to fluctuate  and prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are beyond our control 
we depend primarily on fuel surcharges  volume purchasing arrangements with truck stop chains  and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals to control our fuel expenses 
we previously used commodity swap agreements to partially hedge our exposure to diesel fuel price fluctuations  but the last remaining agreement expired prior to december  there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect fuel surcharges or enter into successful hedges in the future 
fluctuations in fuel prices  or a shortage of diesel fuel  could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are co defendants with mwl in a lawsuit relating to mwl  and if we are held liable as a result of the pending litigation  or mwl fails to fulfill its obligations to us  our financial condition could be adversely affected 
in april  we  together with mitchell ward  randy bowman and mwl  were named as defendants in an adversary proceeding in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of texas 
the proceeding was instituted by the interim trustee of the bankruptcy estate of mitchell ward trucking  inc the complaint alleges  among other things  that messrs ward and bowman breached their fiduciary duties to the debtor by diverting business opportunities of the debtor to mwl  and that we conspired with the other defendants and tortiously interfered with existing and prospective contractual relations of the debtor 
although we believe that the claims asserted against us in this proceeding are without merit  and we intend to vigorously defend this matter  we could incur material expenses in the defense and resolution of this proceeding 
seasonality and the impact of weather can affect our profitability 
our tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency  increased claims  and more equipment repairs 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
the united states department of transportation  or dot  and various state and local agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  and insurance requirements 
our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the dot  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service 
the dot adopted revised hours of service regulations in april  effective january  this change could reduce the potential or practical amount of time that drivers can spend driving  if we are unable to limit their other on duty activities 
we have negotiated delay time charges with the majority of our customers and have completed training with our drivers and operations personnel 
while our preliminary expectation  based on our initial experience  is that the rules will not significantly disrupt our operations or materially affect our results of operations  significant uncompensated shortfalls in our utilization due to compliance with this regulation could adversely impact our profitability 
the engines used in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions control regulations  which may substantially increase our operating expenses 
the environmental protection agency  or epa  adopted new emissions control regulations  which require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through  for engines manufactured in october  and thereafter 
the new regulations decrease the amount of emissions that can be released by truck engines and affect tractors produced after the effective date of the regulations 
compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors and could substantially impair equipment productivity  lower fuel mileage  and increase our operating expenses 
some manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices  in part to meet new engine design requirements imposed by the epa  and eliminated or sharply reduced the price of repurchase commitments 
these adverse effects combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  most importantly the effects of the price and availability of diesel fuel and changes in interest rates 
our operations are heavily dependent upon the use of diesel fuel 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can vary and are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are beyond our control 
significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  we have been able to recover a portion of diesel fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we previously utilized commodity swap agreements to partially hedge our exposure to diesel fuel price fluctuations  but all such agreements expired by december  we presently use fuel surcharges to address the risk of high fuel prices 
fuel surcharge programs are widely accepted among our customers  though they can vary somewhat from customer to customer 
we believe fuel surcharges are effective at mitigating the risk of high fuel prices  although we do not recover the full amount of fuel price increases 
interest rate risk our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates 
we have historically maintained a combination of fixed rate and variable rate obligations to manage our interest rate exposure 
fixed rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might fall 
variable rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might rise 
we did not have any interest rate swaps at december   although we may enter into such swaps in the future if we deem appropriate 
our fixed rate obligations consist of amounts outstanding under our unsecured senior notes 
the million outstanding at december   under our series a senior notes bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 
the million outstanding at december   under our series b senior notes bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 
based on such outstanding amounts  a one percentage point decline in interest rates would have the effect of increasing the premium we pay over market interest rates by approximately  annually 
our variable rate obligations have historically consisted of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate based on either the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor 
we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december
