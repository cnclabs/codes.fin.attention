government regulation we are subject to complex and stringent energy  environmental and other governmental laws and regulations at the federal  state and local levels in connection with the development  ownership and operation of our energy generation facilities 
federal laws and regulations govern transactions by electric and gas utility companies  the types of fuel which may be utilized by an electricity generating plant  the type of energy which may be produced by such a plant  the ownership of a plant  and access to and service on the transmission grid 
in most instances  public utilities that serve retail customers are subject to rate regulation by the state s related utility regulatory commission 
a state utility regulatory commission is often primarily responsible for determining whether a public utility may recover the costs of wholesale electricity purchases or other supply related activity through retail rates that the public utility may charge its customers 
the state utility regulatory commission may  from time to time  impose restrictions or limitations on the manner in which a public utility may transact with wholesale power sellers  such as independent power producers 
under certain circumstances where specific exemptions are otherwise unavailable  state utility regulatory commissions may have broad jurisdiction over non utility electric power plants 
energy producing projects also are subject to federal  state and local laws and administrative regulations which govern the emissions and other substances produced  discharged or disposed of by a plant and the geographical location  zoning  land use and operation of a plant 
applicable federal environmental laws typically have both state and local enforcement and implementation provisions 
these environmental laws and regulations generally require that a wide variety of permits and other approvals be obtained before the commencement of construction or operation of an energy producing facility and that the facility then operate in compliance with such permits and approvals 
federal energy regulation purpa the enactment of the public utility regulatory policies act of  as amended purpa  and the adoption of regulations thereunder by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc provided incentives for the development of cogeneration facilities and small power production facilities those utilizing renewable fuels and having a capacity of less than megawatts 

table of contents a domestic electricity generating project must be a qualifying facility qf under ferc regulations in order to take advantage of certain rate and regulatory incentives provided by purpa 
purpa exempts owners of qfs from the public utility holding company act of  as amended puhca  and exempts qfs from most provisions of the federal power act fpa and  except under certain limited circumstances  state laws concerning rate or financial regulation 
these exemptions are important to us and our competitors 
we believe that each of the electricity generating projects in which we own an interest and which operates as a qf power producer meets or will meet the requirements under purpa necessary for qf status 
in some cases our projects have temporarily been rendered incapable of meeting such requirements due  for example  to the loss of a thermal host and we have sought waivers of the applicable qf requirements from ferc 
in the past ferc has been willing to issue such waivers which typically are for a one or two year period where it can be shown that the project is expected to be able to meet the applicable qf requirements at the end of the waiver period  however  we cannot provide assurance that such waivers will in every case be granted 
purpa provides two primary benefits to qfs 
first  qfs generally are relieved of compliance with extensive federal and state regulations that control the financial structure of an electricity generating plant and the prices and terms on which electricity may be sold by the plant 
second  ferc s regulations promulgated under purpa require that electric utilities purchase electricity generated by qfs at a price based on the purchasing utility s avoided cost  and that the utility sell back up power to the qf on a non discriminatory basis 
the term avoided cost is defined as the incremental cost to an electric utility of electric energy or capacity  or both  which  but for the purchase from qfs  such utility would generate for itself or purchase from another source 
ferc regulations also permit qfs and utilities to negotiate agreements for utility purchases of power at rates lower than the utilities avoided costs 
while public utilities are not explicitly required by purpa to enter into long term power sales agreements  purpa helped to create a regulatory environment in which it has been common for long term agreements to be negotiated 
in order to be a qf  a cogeneration facility must produce not only electricity  but also useful thermal energy for use in an industrial or commercial process for heating or cooling applications in certain proportions to the facility s total energy output  and must meet certain energy efficiency standards 
a geothermal facility may qualify as a qf if it produces less than megawatts of electricity 
finally  a qf including a geothermal qf or other qualifying small power producer must not be controlled or more than owned by one or more electric utilities or by most electric utility holding companies  or one or more subsidiaries of such a utility or holding company or any combination thereof 
we endeavor to develop our projects  monitor compliance by the projects with applicable regulations and choose our customers in a manner which minimizes the risks of any project losing its qf status 
certain factors necessary to maintain qf status are  however  subject to the risk of events outside our control 
for example  loss of a thermal energy customer or failure of a thermal energy customer to take required amounts of thermal energy from a cogeneration facility that is a qf could cause the facility to fail requirements regarding the level of useful thermal energy output 
upon the occurrence of such an event  we would seek to replace the thermal energy customer or find another use for the thermal energy which meets purpa s requirements  but no assurance can be given that this would be possible 
if one of the facilities in which we have an interest should lose its status as a qf  the project would no longer be entitled to the exemptions from puhca and the fpa 
this could also trigger certain rights of termination under the facility s power sales agreement  could subject the facility to rate regulation as a public utility under the fpa and state law and could result in us inadvertently becoming an electric utility holding company by owning more than of the voting securities of  or controlling  a facility that would no longer be exempt from puhca 
this could cause all of our remaining projects to lose their qualifying status  because qfs may not be controlled or more than owned by such electric utility holding companies 
loss of qf status may also trigger defaults under covenants to maintain qf status in the projects power sales agreements  steam sales agreements and financing agreements and result in termination  penalties or acceleration of indebtedness under such agreements such that loss of status may be on a retroactive or a prospective basis 

table of contents under the energy policy act of  if a facility can be qualified as an exempt wholesale generator ewg  meaning that all of its output is sold for resale rather than to end users  it will be exempt from puhca even if it does not qualify as a qf 
therefore  another response to the loss or potential loss of qf status would be to apply to have the project qualified as an ewg 
however  assuming this changed status would be permissible under the terms of the applicable power sales agreement  rate approval from ferc would be required 
in addition  the facility would be required to cease selling electricity to any retail customers such as the thermal energy customer to retain its ewg status and could become subject to state regulation of sales of thermal energy 
see public utility holding company regulation 
currently  congress is considering proposed legislation that would repeal puhca and amend purpa by limiting its mandatory purchase obligation to existing contracts  in those regions of the country that are found to have competitive energy markets 
in light of the circumstances in california  the pacific gas and electric company pg e bankruptcy and the enron bankruptcy  among other events in recent years  there are a number of federal legislative and regulatory initiatives that could result in changes in how the energy markets are regulated 
we do not know whether these legislative and regulatory initiatives will be adopted or  if adopted  what form they may take 
we cannot provide assurance that any legislation or regulation ultimately adopted would not adversely affect our existing domestic projects 
public utility holding company regulation under puhca  any corporation  partnership or other legal entity which owns or controls or more of the outstanding voting securities of a public utility company  or a company which is a holding company for a public utility company  is subject to registration with the securities and exchange commission sec and regulation under puhca  unless eligible for an exemption 
a holding company of a public utility company that is subject to registration is required by puhca to limit its utility operations to a single integrated utility system and to divest any other operations not functionally related to the operation of that utility system 
approval by the sec is required for nearly all important financial and business dealings of a registered holding company 
under purpa  most qfs are not public utility companies under puhca 
the energy policy act of  among other things  amends puhca to allow ewgs  under certain circumstances  to own and operate non qf electric generating facilities without subjecting those producers to registration or regulation under puhca 
the effect of such amendments has been to enhance the development of non qfs which do not have to meet the fuel  production and ownership requirements of purpa 
we believe that these amendments benefit us by expanding our ability to own and operate facilities that do not qualify for qf status 
however  they have also resulted in increased competition by allowing utilities and their affiliates to develop such facilities which are not subject to the constraints of puhca 
federal natural gas transportation regulation we have an ownership interest in gas fired power plants in operation or under construction 
the cost of natural gas is ordinarily the largest expense of a gas fired project and is critical to the project s economics 
the risks associated with using natural gas can include the need to arrange gathering  processing  extraction  blending  and storage  as well as transportation of the gas from great distances  including obtaining removal  export and import authority if the gas is transported from canada  the possibility of interruption of the gas supply or transportation depending on the quality of the gas reserves purchased or dedicated to the project  the financial and operating strength of the gas supplier  whether firm or non firm transportation is purchased and the operations of the gas pipeline  and obligations to take a minimum quantity of gas and pay for it ie  take and pay obligations 
pursuant to the natural gas act  ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce 
with respect to most transactions that do not involve the construction of pipeline facilities  regulatory authorization can be obtained on a self implementing basis 
however  interstate pipeline rates and terms and conditions for such services are subject to continuing ferc oversight 

table of contents federal power act regulation under the fpa  ferc is authorized to regulate the transmission of electric energy and the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce 
unless otherwise exempt  any person that owns or operates facilities used for such purposes is considered a public utility subject to ferc jurisdiction 
ferc regulation under the fpa includes approval of the disposition of utility property  authorization of the issuance of securities by public utilities  regulation of the rates  terms and conditions for the transmission or sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce  the regulation of interlocking directorates  a uniform system of accounts and reporting requirements for public utilities 
ferc regulations implementing purpa provide that a qf is exempt from regulation under the foregoing provisions of the fpa 
an ewg is not exempt from the fpa and therefore an ewg that makes sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce is subject to ferc regulation as a public utility 
however  many of the regulations which customarily apply to traditional public utilities have been waived or relaxed for power marketers  ewgs and other non traditional public utilities that lack market power 
ewgs are regularly granted authorization to charge market based rates  blanket authority to issue securities  and waivers of certain ferc requirements pertaining to accounts  reports and interlocking directorates 
such action is intended to implement ferc s policy to foster a more competitive wholesale power market 
many of the generating projects in which we own an interest are operated as qfs and are therefore exempt from ferc regulation under the fpa 
however  several of our generating projects are or will be ewgs subject to ferc jurisdiction under the fpa 
several of our affiliates have been granted authority to engage in sales at market based rates and to issue securities  and have also been granted the customary waivers of ferc regulations available to non traditional public utilities  however  we cannot assure that such authorities or waivers will be granted in the future to other affiliates 
federal open access electric transmission regulation in the summer of ferc issued orders nos 
and ordering the functional unbundling of transmission and generation assets by the transmission owning utilities subject to its jurisdiction 
under order no 
 the jurisdictional transmission owning utilities  and many non jurisdictional transmission owners  were required to adopt the pro forma open access transmission tariff establishing terms of non discriminatory transmission service  including generator interconnection service 
order no 
required transmission owning utilities to publish information concerning the availability of transmission capacity and make such transmission capacity available on a non discriminatory basis 
in addition  these orders established the operational requirements of independent system operators iso  which are entities that have been given authority to operate the transmission assets of certain jurisdictional utilities 
the interpretation and application of the requirements of orders nos 
and continues to be refined through subsequent administrative proceedings at ferc 
these orders have been subject to review  and have been affirmed  by the courts 
in december ferc issued order no 
 which requires jurisdictional transmission owning utilities to enter into agreements with isos to operate their transmission systems or join a regional transmission organization rto  which would likewise control the transmission facilities in a certain region 
order no 
sets forth the basic governance terms for rtos 
to date  compliance by the transmission owning utilities has been uneven and has met with political resistance on the part of the state governments and the state public utilities commissions in some regions of the country 
the impact on our business of the implementation of order no 
and the development of rtos cannot be predicted 
in addition to its efforts in order nos 
  and and in creating rtos  ferc has attempted to further refine and clarify the rights and obligations of owners and users of the interstate transmission grid in its standard market design smd and interconnection rule making proceedings 
ferc s intention under the smd proceedings is to establish a set of standard rules  which could be adopted in the form of a revised tariff by transmission owning utilities  addressing the manner in which transmission capacity would be allocated  how generation would be dispatched given transmission constraints  the coordination of transmission upgrades and the allocation of costs associated therewith  among other transmission related issues 
the smd rule making proceeding is pending currently 
the timing of ferc s issuance of a final order in this proceeding 
table of contents is uncertain and has been delayed due to political resistance on the part of the state governments and the state public utilities commissions in some regions in the country 
the impact on our business due to the issuance of a final order in this proceeding is uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time 
on july   ferc issued order no 
which is the final rule in the interconnection rule making proceeding 
order no 
establishes uniform procedures for generator interconnection to the transmission grid  including the allocation of some of the costs associated with transmission system upgrades and special facilities required to interconnect the generator to the grid 
pursuant to order no 
 transmission owners have been directed to make compliance filings with the ferc to implement the requirements of the order 
the purpose of order no 
is to provide greater certainty and reduce costs associated with the interconnection of new generation facilities to the transmission grid 
western energy markets there was significant price volatility in both wholesale electricity and gas markets in the western united states for much of calendar year and extending through the second quarter of due to a number factors  including drier than expected weather  which led to lower than normal hydro electric capacity in california and the northwestern united states  inadequate natural gas pipeline and electric generation capacity to meet higher than anticipated energy demand in the region  the inability of the california utilities to manage their exposure to such price volatility due to regulatory and financial constraints  and evolving market structures in california  prices for electricity and natural gas were much higher than anticipated 
a number of federal and state investigations and proceedings were commenced to address the crisis 
there are currently a number of proceedings pending at ferc which were initiated as a direct result of the price volatility in the energy markets in the western united states during this period 
many of these proceedings were initiated by buyers of wholesale electricity seeking refunds for purchases made during this period or the reduction of price terms in contracts entered into at this time 
we have been a party to some of these proceedings 
see item business risk factors california power market and item legal proceedings 
as part of certain proceedings  and as a result of its own investigations  ferc has ordered the implementation of certain measures for wholesale electricity markets in california and the western united states  including  the implementation of price caps on the day ahead or real time prices for electricity through september   and a continuing obligation of electricity generators to offer uncommitted generation capacity to the california independent system operator 
ferc is continuing to investigate the causes of the price volatility in the western united states during this period 
it is uncertain at this time when these proceedings and investigations at ferc will conclude or what will be the final resolution thereof 
see risk factors california power market below 
other federal and state governmental entities have and continue to conduct various investigations into the causes of the price volatility in the energy markets in the western united states during this time 
it is uncertain at this time when these investigations will conclude or what the results may be 
the impact on our business of the results of the investigations cannot be predicted at this time 
state regulation state public utility commissions pucs have historically had broad authority to regulate both the rates charged by  and the financial activities of  electric utilities operating in their states and to promulgate regulation for implementation of purpa 
since a power sales agreement becomes a part of a utility s cost structure generally reflected in its retail rates  power sales agreements with independent electricity producers  such as ewgs  are potentially under the regulatory purview of pucs and in particular the process by which the utility has entered into the power sales agreements 
if a puc has approved the process by which a utility secures its power supply  a puc is generally inclined to pass through the expense associated with a power purchase agreement with an independent power producer to the utility s retail customers 
however  a regulatory commission under certain circumstances may disallow the full reimbursement to a utility for the cost to purchase power from a qf or an ewg 
in addition  retail sales of electricity or thermal energy by an independent power producer may be subject to puc regulation depending on state law 
independent power 
table of contents producers which are not qfs under purpa  or ewgs pursuant to the energy policy act of  are considered to be public utilities in many states and are subject to broad regulation by a puc  ranging from requirement of certificate of public convenience and necessity to regulation of organizational  accounting  financial and other corporate matters 
states may assert jurisdiction over the siting and construction of electricity generating facilities including qfs and ewgs and  with the exception of qfs  over the issuance of securities and the sale or other transfer of assets by these facilities 
state pucs also have jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas by local distribution companies ldcs 
each state s regulatory laws are somewhat different  however  all generally require the ldc to obtain approval from the puc for the construction of facilities and transportation services if the ldcs generally applicable tariffs do not cover the proposed transaction 
ldc rates are usually subject to continuing puc oversight 
we own and operate numerous midstream assets in a number of states where we have plants and or oil and gas production 
regulation of canadian gas the canadian natural gas industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal and provincial authorities 
at the federal level  a party exporting gas from canada must obtain an export license from the national energy board neb 
the neb also regulates canadian pipeline transportation rates and the construction of pipeline facilities 
gas producers also must obtain a removal permit or license from each provincial authority before natural gas may be removed from the province  and provincial authorities regulate intra provincial pipeline and gathering systems 
in addition  a party importing natural gas into the united states first must obtain an import authorization from the us department of energy 
environmental regulations the exploration for and development of geothermal resources  oil  gas liquids and natural gas  and the construction and operation of wells  fields  pipelines  various other mid stream facilities and equipment  and power projects  are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations adopted for the protection of the environment and to regulate land use 
the laws and regulations applicable to us primarily involve the discharge of emissions into the water and air and the use of water  but can also include wetlands preservation  endangered species  hazardous materials handling and disposal  waste disposal and noise regulations 
these laws and regulations in many cases require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining licenses  permits and approvals from federal  state and local agencies 
noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines or penalties 
in some instances  environmental laws also may impose clean up or other remedial obligations in the event of a release of pollutants or contaminants into the environment 
the following federal laws are among the more significant environmental laws as they apply to us 
in most cases  analogous state laws also exist that may impose similar  and in some cases more stringent  requirements on us as those discussed below 
clean air act the federal clean air act of the clean air act provides for the regulation  largely through state implementation of federal requirements  of emissions of air pollutants from certain facilities and operations 
as originally enacted  the clean air act sets guidelines for emissions standards for major pollutants ie  sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide from newly built sources 
in late  congress passed the clean air act amendments the amendments 
the amendments attempt to reduce emissions from existing sources  particularly previously exempted older power plants 
we believe that all of our operating plants and relevant oil and gas related facilities are in compliance with federal performance standards mandated under the clean air act and the amendments 

table of contents clean water act the federal clean water act the clean water act establishes rules regulating the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states 
we are required to obtain wastewater and storm water discharge permits for wastewater and runoff  respectively  from certain of our facilities 
we believe that  with respect to our geothermal and oil and gas operations  we are exempt from newly promulgated federal storm water requirements 
we are required to maintain a spill prevention control and countermeasure plan with respect to certain of our oil and gas facilities 
we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable discharge requirements of the clean water act 
oil pollution act of the oil pollution act of opa applies to our offshore facilities in the us gulf of mexico regulating oil pollution prevention measures and financial responsibility requirements 
we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable opa requirements 
safe drinking water act part c of the safe water drinking act swda mandates the underground injection control uic program 
the uic regulates the disposal of wastes by means of deep well injection 
deep well injection is a common method of disposing of saltwater  produced water and other oil and gas wastes 
we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable uic requirements of the swda 
resource conservation and recovery act the resource conservation and recovery act rcra regulates the generation  treatment  storage  handling  transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste 
we believe that we are exempt from solid waste requirements under rcra 
however  particularly with respect to our solid waste disposal practices at the power generation facilities and steam fields located at the geysers  we are subject to certain solid waste requirements under applicable california laws 
based on the exploration and production exception  many oil and gas wastes are exempt from hazardous wastes regulation under rcra 
for those wastes generated in association with the exploration and production of oil and gas which are classified as hazardous wastes  we undertake to comply with the rcra requirements for identification and disposal 
various state environmental and safety laws also regulate the oil and gas industry 
we believe that our operations are in material compliance with rcra and all such laws 
comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla or superfund  requires cleanup of sites from which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances and authorizes the united states environmental protection agency to take any necessary response action at superfund sites  including ordering potentially responsible parties prps liable for the release to take or pay for such actions 
prps are broadly defined under cercla to include past and present owners and operators of  as well as generators of wastes sent to  a site 
as of the present time  we are not subject to liability for any superfund matters 
however  we generate certain wastes  including hazardous wastes  and send certain of our wastes to third party waste disposal sites 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will not incur liability under cercla in the future 
canadian environmental  health and safety regulations our canadian power projects and oil and gas operations are also subject to extensive federal  provincial and local laws and regulations adopted for the protection of the environment and to regulate land use 
we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable requirements under canadian law related to same

varied remedies are available for enforcement of these federal  state and local rules  regulations and procedures  including fines  penalties  revocation of permits and licenses  actions affecting the value of leases  wells or other assets  and suspension of production 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will not incur liability for fines and penalties or otherwise subject calpine to the various remedies as are available to these federal  state and local authorities 
however  we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these federal  state and local rules  regulations and procedures 
risk factors capital resources we have substantial indebtedness that we may be unable to service and that restricts our activities 
we have substantial debt that we incurred to finance the acquisition and development of power generation facilities 
as of december   our total consolidated funded debt was billion  our total consolidated assets were billion and our stockholders equity was billion 
whether we will be able to meet our debt service obligations and repay  extend  or refinance our outstanding indebtedness will be dependent primarily upon the operational performance of our power generation facilities and of our oil and gas properties  movements in electric and natural gas prices over time  and our marketing and risk management activities 
this high level of indebtedness has important consequences  including limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  execution of our growth strategy  or other purposes  limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service the debt  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation  limiting our ability or increasing the costs to refinance indebtedness  and limiting our ability to enter into marketing  hedging  optimization and trading transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom we can transact as well as the volume of those transactions

table of contents lease properties  engage in transactions with affiliates  create liens  consolidate or merge with another entity  or allow one of our subsidiaries to do so  sell assets  and acquire facilities or other businesses 
also  if our ownership changes  the indentures governing certain of our senior notes may require us to make an offer to purchase those senior notes 
we cannot assure that we will have the financial resources necessary to purchase those senior notes in this event 
if we are unable to comply with the terms of our indentures and other debt agreements  or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or to refinance our debt as described below  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our senior notes and other debt or to obtain additional financing 
however  we may be unable to refinance or obtain additional financing because of our high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions under our indentures and other debt agreements 
if cash flow is insufficient and refinancing or additional financing is unavailable  we may be forced to default on our senior notes and other debt obligations 
in the event of a default under the terms of any of our indebtedness  the debt holders may accelerate the maturity of our obligations  which could cause defaults under our other obligations 
in addition  our unsecured senior notes and our other senior unsecured debt are effectively subordinated to all of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 
our secured indebtedness includes our billion second priority senior secured term loans and notes 
the term loans and notes are secured by a second priority lien on  among other things  substantially all of the assets owned directly by calpine corporation  including natural gas and power plant assets and the equity in all of the subsidiaries directly owned by calpine corporation 
we also have a million working capital facility that is secured by a first priority lien on the same assets that secure our billion second priority senior secured term loans and notes 
the noteholders recourse on our million ccfc i institutional term loans and secured notes is limited to the assets and contracts associated with the seven natural gas fired electric generating facilities owned by ccfc i and its subsidiaries as adjusted for approved dispositions and acquisitions  such as the completed sale of lost pines power project and the pending acquisition of the brazos valley power plant 
the lenders recourse on our billion calgen  formerly ccfc ii secured revolving construction financing facility was limited to the assets and contracts associated with the natural gas fired electric generating facilities owned by subsidiaries of calgen 
the secured institutional term loans and secured notes issued by calgen  that in march refinanced the billion calgen facility  are secured  through a combination of direct and indirect stock pledges and asset liens  by calgen s power generating facilities and related assets located throughout the united states  and the lenders recourse is limited to such security 
we have additional non recourse project financings  secured in each case by the assets of the project being financed 
we must refinance our debt maturing in and since the latter half of  there has been a significant contraction in the availability of capital for participants in the energy sector 
this has been due to a range of factors  including uncertainty arising from the collapse of enron corp 
and a perceived surplus of electric generating capacity 
these factors have continued through and  during which contracting credit markets and decreased spark spreads have adversely impacted our liquidity and earnings 
while we have been able to access the capital and bank credit markets  it has been on significantly different terms than in the past 
we recognize that terms of financing available to us in the future may not be attractive 
to protect against this possibility and due to current market conditions  we scaled back our capital expenditure program to enable us to conserve our available capital resources 
as discussed above  in march we refinanced our ccfc ii construction facility that had been scheduled to mature in november we are subject to a holders put on december   which may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the convertible 
table of contents senior notes then outstanding with our choice of cash  stock or a combination thereof

we have million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of notes issued in connection with the monetization of a power contract with california department of water resources dwr which will mature in in addition to the debt instruments discussed above  we have approximately million and million of miscellaneous debt and capital lease obligations that are maturing or for which scheduled principal payments will be made in and  respectively 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when due  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity 
while we believe we will be successful in refinancing all of our debt on or before maturity  we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
we may be unable to secure additional financing in the future 
each power generation facility that we acquire or develop will require substantial capital investment 
our ability to arrange financing including any extension or refinancing and the cost of the financing are dependent upon numerous factors 
access to capital including any extension or refinancing for participants in the energy sector  including for us  has been significantly restricted since late other factors include general economic and capital market conditions  conditions in energy markets  regulatory developments  credit availability from banks or other lenders for us and our industry peers  as well as the economy in general  investor confidence in the industry and in us  the continued success of our current power generation facilities  and provisions of tax and securities laws that are conducive to raising capital 
we have financed our existing power generation facilities using a variety of leveraged financing structures  consisting of senior secured and unsecured indebtedness  construction financing  project financing  revolving credit facilities  term loans and lease obligations 
as of december   we had approximately billion of total consolidated funded debt  consisting of billion of secured construction project financing  billion of capital lease obligations  billion in senior notes  billion in convertible senior notes  billion in preferred interests  billion of trust preferred securities and billion of secured and unsecured notes payable and borrowings under lines of credit 
each project financing and lease obligation is structured to be fully paid out of cash flow provided by the facility or facilities financed or leased 
in the event of a default under a financing agreement which we do not cure  the lenders or lessors would generally have rights to the facility and any related assets 
in the event of foreclosure after a default  we might not retain any interest in the facility 
while we intend to utilize non recourse or lease financing when appropriate  market conditions and other factors may prevent similar financing for future facilities 
it is possible that we may be unable to obtain the financing required to develop our power generation facilities on terms satisfactory to us 

table of contents we have from time to time guaranteed certain obligations of our subsidiaries and other affiliates 
our lenders or lessors may also seek to have us guarantee the indebtedness for future facilities 
guarantees render our general corporate funds vulnerable in the event of a default by the facility or related subsidiary 
additionally  certain of our indentures may restrict our ability to guarantee future debt  which could adversely affect our ability to fund new facilities 
our indentures do not limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur non recourse or lease financing for investment in new facilities 
our credit ratings have been downgraded and could be downgraded further 
on july   standard poor s placed our corporate rating currently rated at b  our senior unsecured debt rating currently at ccc  our preferred stock rating currently at ccc  our bank loan rating currently at b  and our second priority senior secured debt rating currently at b under review for possible downgrade 
on july   fitch  inc downgraded our long term senior unsecured debt rating from b to b with a stable outlook  our preferred stock rating from b to ccc with a stable outlook  and initiated coverage of our senior secured debt rating at bb with a stable outlook 
on october   moody s downgraded the rating of our long term senior unsecured debt from b to caa with a stable outlook and our senior implied rating from ba to b with a stable outlook 
the ratings on our senior unsecured debt  senior unsecured convertible debt and convertible preferred securities were also lowered with a stable outlook from b to caa  from b to caa and from b to caa  respectively 
many other issuers in the power generation sector have also been downgraded by one or more of the ratings agencies during this period 
such downgrades can have a negative impact on our liquidity by reducing attractive financing opportunities and increasing the amount of collateral required by trading counterparties 
we cannot assure you that moody s  fitch and standard poor s will not further downgrade our credit ratings in the future 
if our credit rating is downgraded  we could be required to  among other things  pay additional interest under our credit agreements  or provide additional guarantees  collateral  letters of credit or cash for credit support obligations  and it could increase our cost of capital  make our efforts to raise capital more difficult and have an adverse impact on our subsidiaries and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to repay our debt depends upon the performance of our subsidiaries 
almost all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and other affiliates 
as a result  we depend almost entirely upon their earnings and cash flow to service our indebtedness  including our ability to pay the interest and principal of our senior notes 
the financing agreements of certain of our subsidiaries and other affiliates generally restrict their ability to pay dividends  make distributions  or otherwise transfer funds to us prior to the payment of their other obligations  including their outstanding debt  operating expenses  lease payments and reserves 
our subsidiaries and other affiliates are separate and distinct legal entities and  except in limited circumstances  have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our senior notes or our million secured working capital credit facility and do not guarantee the payment of interest on or principal of such debt 
the right of the holders of such debt to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries or other affiliates upon our liquidation or reorganization will be subordinated to the claims of any subsidiaries or other affiliates creditors including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by our subsidiaries or affiliates 
as of december   our subsidiaries had billion of secured construction project financing 
we may utilize project financing when appropriate in the future  and this financing will be effectively senior to our secured and unsecured debt 
the senior note indentures and our senior secured credit facilities impose limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness 
however  the senior note indentures do not limit the amount of construction project financing that our subsidiaries may incur to finance the acquisition and development of new power generation facilities 
the senior secured credit facilities do impose limitations on certain types of non recourse financings 

table of contents operations revenue may be reduced significantly upon expiration or termination of our power sales agreements 
some of the electricity we generate from our existing portfolio is sold under long term power sales agreements that expire at various times 
we also sell power under short to intermediate to year contracts 
when the terms of each of these various power sales agreements expire  it is possible that the price paid to us for the generation of electricity under subsequent arrangements may be reduced significantly 
use of derivatives can create volatility in earnings and may require significant cash collateral 
during we recognized million in mark to market losses on electric power and natural gas derivatives 
additionally  we recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  an after tax gain of approximately million from the adoption of derivatives implementation group dig issue no 
c  scope exceptions interpretation of the meaning of not clearly and closely related in paragraph b regarding contracts with a price adjustment feature on october  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation impact of recent accounting pronouncements for a detailed discussion of the accounting requirements relating to electric power and natural gas derivatives 
in addition  generally accepted accounting principles gaap treatment of derivatives in general  and particularly in our industry  continues to evolve 
we may enter into other transactions in future periods that require us to mark various derivatives to market through earnings 
the nature of the transactions that we enter into and the volatility of natural gas and electric power prices will determine the volatility of earnings that we may experience related to these transactions 
as a result  in part  of the fallout from enron s declaration of bankruptcy on december   companies using derivatives have become more sensitive to the inherent risks of such transactions 
consequently  many companies  including us  are requiring cash collateral for certain derivative transactions in excess of what was previously required 
as of december   we had million in margin deposits with counterparties  net of deposits posted by counterparties with us  and had posted million of letters of credit  compared to million and million  respectively  at december  future cash collateral requirements may increase based on the extent of our involvement in derivative activities and movements in commodity prices and also based on our credit ratings and general perception of creditworthiness in this market 
we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas in the future 
to date  our fuel acquisition strategy has included various combinations of our own gas reserves  gas prepayment contracts  short  medium and long term supply contracts and gas hedging transactions 
in our gas supply arrangements  we attempt to match the fuel cost with the fuel component included in the facility s power sales agreements in order to minimize a project s exposure to fuel price risk 
in addition  the focus of ces is to manage the spark spread for our portfolio of generating plants the spread between the cost of fuel and electricity revenues and we actively enter into hedging transactions to lock in gas costs and spark spreads 
we believe that there will be adequate supplies of natural gas available at reasonable prices for each of our facilities when current gas supply agreements expire 
however  gas supplies may not be available for the full term of the facilities power sales agreements  and gas prices may increase significantly 
additionally  our credit ratings may inhibit our ability to procure gas supplies from third parties 
if gas is not available  or if gas prices increase above the level that can be recovered in electricity prices  there could be a negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
our power project development and acquisition activities may not be successful 
the development of power generation facilities is subject to substantial risks 
in connection with the development of a power generation facility  we must generally obtain necessary power generation equipment  governmental permits and approvals  fuel supply and transportation agreements  sufficient equity capital and debt financing  
table of contents electrical transmission agreements  water supply and wastewater discharge agreements  and site agreements and construction contracts 
we may be unsuccessful in accomplishing any of these matters or in doing so on a timely basis 
in addition  project development is subject to various environmental  engineering and construction risks relating to cost overruns  delays and performance 
although we may attempt to minimize the financial risks in the development of a project by securing a favorable power sales agreement  obtaining all required governmental permits and approvals  and arranging adequate financing prior to the commencement of construction  the development of a power project may require us to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering  permitting  legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible  economically attractive or financeable 
if we are unable to complete the development of a facility  we might not be able to recover our investment in the project 
the process for obtaining initial environmental  siting and other governmental permits and approvals is complicated and lengthy  often taking more than one year  and is subject to significant uncertainties 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in the development of power generation facilities in the future or that we will be able to successfully complete construction of our facilities currently in development  nor can we assure you that any of these facilities will be profitable or have value equal to the investment in them even if they do achieve commercial operation 
we have grown substantially in recent years partly as a result of acquisitions of interests in power generation facilities  geothermal steam fields and natural gas reserves and facilities 
the integration and consolidation of our acquisitions with our existing business requires substantial management  financial and other resources and  ultimately  our acquisitions may not be successfully integrated 
in addition  as we transition from a development company to an operating company  we are not likely to continue to grow at historical rates due to reduced acquisition activities in the near future 
thus  we have also substantially curtailed our development efforts in response to our reduced liquidity 
although the domestic power industry is continuing to undergo consolidation and may offer acquisition opportunities at favorable prices  we believe that we are likely to confront significant competition for those opportunities and  due to the constriction in the availability of capital resources for acquisitions and other expansion  to the extent that any opportunities are identified  we may be unable to effect any acquisitions 
similarly  to the extent we seek to divest assets  we may not be able to do so at attractive prices 
our projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled 
the commencement of operation of a newly constructed power generation facility involves many risks  including start up problems  the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
new plants have no operating history and may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment 
insurance including a layer of insurance provided by a captive insurance subsidiary is maintained to protect against certain risks  warranties are generally obtained for limited periods relating to the construction of each project and its equipment in varying degrees  and contractors and equipment suppliers are obligated to meet certain performance levels 
the insurance  warranties or performance guarantees  however  may not be adequate to cover lost revenues or increased expenses 
as a result  a project may be unable to fund principal and interest payments under its financing obligations and may operate at a loss 
a default under such a financing obligation  unless cured  could result in our losing our interest in a power generation facility 
in certain situations  power sales agreements entered into with a utility early in the development phase of a project may enable the utility to terminate the agreement  or to retain security posted as liquidated damages  if a project fails to achieve commercial operation or certain operating levels by specified dates or fails to make specified payments 
in the event a termination right is exercised  the default provisions in a financing agreement may be triggered rendering such debt immediately due and payable 
as a result  the project may be rendered insolvent and we may lose our interest in the project 
in recent years we have begun to rely more 
table of contents frequently on traditional project financing  so the risk of a financing agreement default linked to a default under a power sales agreement may come into play 
our power generation facilities may not operate as planned 
upon completion of our projects currently under construction  we will operate of the power plants in which we will have an interest 
the continued operation of power generation facilities  including  upon completion of construction  the facilities owned directly by calpine  involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment  transmission lines  pipelines or other equipment or processes  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
although from time to time our power generation facilities have experienced equipment breakdowns or failures  these breakdowns or failures have not had a significant effect on the operation of the facilities or on our results of operations 
for calendar year  our gas fired and geothermal power generation facilities operated at an average availability of approximately and  respectively 
although our facilities contain various redundancies and back up mechanisms  a breakdown or failure may prevent the affected facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements 
in addition  although insurance is maintained to protect against operating risks  the proceeds of insurance may not be adequate to cover lost revenues or increased expenses 
as a result  we could be unable to service principal and interest payments under our financing obligations which could result in losing our interest in one or more power generation facility 
we cannot assure you that our estimates of oil and gas reserves are accurate 
estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by independent petroleum and geological engineers 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves  including factors beyond our control and that of our engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves  or of cash flows attributable to such reserves  is a function of the available data  assumptions regarding future oil and gas prices and expenditures for future development and exploitation activities  and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
additionally  reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions  based upon production history  development and exploration activities and prices of oil and gas 
actual future production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses  underlying information  quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information set forth herein 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
our geothermal energy reserves may be inadequate for our operations 
the development and operation of geothermal energy resources are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties similar to those experienced in the development of oil and gas resources 
the successful exploitation of a geothermal energy resource ultimately depends upon the heat content of the extractable steam or fluids  the geology of the reservoir  the total amount of recoverable reserves  operating expenses relating to the extraction of steam or fluids  price levels relating to the extraction of steam or fluids or power generated  and capital expenditure requirements relating primarily to the drilling of new wells 
in connection with each geothermal power plant  we estimate the productivity of the geothermal resource and the expected decline in productivity 
the productivity of a geothermal resource may decline more than anticipated  resulting in insufficient reserves being available for sustained generation of the electrical power capacity desired 
an incorrect estimate by us or an unexpected decline in productivity could  if material  adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents geothermal reservoirs are highly complex 
as a result  there exist numerous uncertainties in determining the extent of the reservoirs and the quantity and productivity of the steam reserves 
reservoir engineering is an inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of steam or fluids that cannot be measured in any precise way  and depends significantly on the quantity and accuracy of available data 
as a result  the estimates of other reservoir specialists may differ materially from ours 
estimates of reserves are generally revised over time on the basis of the results of drilling  testing and production that occur after the original estimate was prepared 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully manage the development and operation of our geothermal reservoirs or that we will accurately estimate the quantity or productivity of our steam reserves 
market we depend on our electricity and thermal energy customers 
our systems of power generation facilities rely on one or more power sales agreements with one or more utilities or other customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 
in addition  sales of electricity to one customer during  the dwr  comprised approximately of our total revenue that year 
the loss of significant power sales agreements with dwr or an adverse change in dwr s ability to pay for power delivered under our contracts could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
in addition  any material failure by any customer to fulfill its obligations under a power sales agreement could have a negative effect on the cash flow available to us and on our results of operations 
competition could adversely affect our performance 
the power generation industry is characterized by intense competition  and we encounter competition from utilities  industrial companies and other independent power producers 
in recent years  there has been increasing competition among generators in an effort to obtain power sales agreements  and this competition has contributed to a reduction in electricity prices in certain markets 
in addition  many states are implementing or considering regulatory initiatives designed to increase competition in the domestic power industry 
in california  the california public utilities commission cpuc issued decisions that provide for direct access for all customers as of april   however  the cpuc suspended direct access in california effective september   due to the problems that arose in california s newly deregulated markets 
as a result  uncertainty exists as to the future course for direct access in california in the aftermath of the energy crisis in that state 
in texas  legislation phased in a deregulated power market  which commenced on january  this competition has put pressure on electric utilities to lower their costs  including the cost of purchased electricity  and increasing competition in the supply of electricity in the future will increase this pressure 
our international investments may face uncertainties 
we have investments in oil and natural gas resources and power projects in canada in development and in operation  an investment in an energy service business in the netherlands  an investment in a power generation facility in development in mexico  and an investment in a power generation facility in the uk that is in operation  and we may pursue additional international investments in the future subject to the limitations on our expansion plans due to current capital market constraints 
international investments are subject to unique risks and uncertainties relating to the political  social and economic structures of the countries in which we invest 
risks specifically related to investments in non united states projects may include fluctuations in currency valuation  currency inconvertibility  expropriation and confiscatory taxation  increased regulation  and approval requirements and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors 

table of contents california power market the unresolved issues arising from the california power market  where of our power plants are located  could adversely affect our performance 
the volatility in the california power market from mid through mid has produced significant unanticipated results 
california refund proceeding 
on august   the california refund proceeding was initiated by a complaint made at ferc by san diego gas electric company under section of the federal power act alleging  among other things  that the markets operated by the california independent system operator caiso and the california power exchange calpx were dysfunctional 
in addition to commencing an inquiry regarding the market structure  ferc established a refund effective period of october   to june   for sales made into those markets 
on december   the administrative law judge issued a certification of proposed finding on california refund liability december certification making an initial determination of refund liability 
on march   ferc also issued an order adopting many of the alj s findings set forth in the december certification the march order 
in addition  as a result of certain findings by the ferc staff concerning the unreliability or misreporting of certain reported indices for gas prices in california during the refund period  ferc ordered that the basis for calculating a party s potential refund liability be modified by substituting a gas proxy price based upon gas prices in the producing areas plus the tariff transportation rate for the california gas price indices previously adopted in the refund proceeding 
we believe  based on information that we have analyzed to date  that any refund liability that may be attributable to us will increase modestly  from approximately million to at least million  after taking the appropriate set offs for outstanding receivables owed by the calpx and caiso to calpine 
we have fully reserved the amount of refund liability that by our current analysis would potentially be owed under the refund calculation clarification in the march order 
we note that  in march  caiso transmitted new tentative price data as part of the process of further refining the refund calculation 
we have not completed our analysis of this new tentative price data which has not been approved by ferc and is subject to change  but it is possible that the revised price data will result in an increase in the refund liability that may be attributable to us 
the final determination of the refund liability is subject to further commission proceedings to ascertain the allocation of payment obligations among the numerous buyers and sellers in the california markets 
at this time  we are unable to predict the timing of the completion of these proceedings or the final refund liability 
thus  the impact on our business is uncertain at this time 
ferc investigation into western markets 
on february   ferc initiated an investigation of potential manipulation of electric and natural gas prices in the western united states 
this investigation was initiated as a result of allegations that enron and others used their market position to distort electric and natural gas markets in the west 
the scope of the investigation is to consider whether  as a result of any manipulation in the short term markets for electric energy or natural gas or other undue influence on the wholesale markets by any party since january   the rates of the long term contracts subsequently entered into in the west are potentially unjust and unreasonable 
ferc has stated that it may use the information gathered in connection with the investigation to determine how to proceed on any existing or future complaint brought under section of the federal power act involving long term power contracts entered into in the west since january   or to initiate a federal power act section or natural gas act section proceeding on its own initiative 
on august   the ferc staff issued the initial report on company specific separate proceedings and generic reevaluations  published natural gas price data  and enron trading strategies the initial report summarizing its initial findings in this investigation 
there were no findings or allegations of wrongdoing by calpine set forth or described in the initial report 
on march   the ferc staff issued a final report in this investigation the final report 
the ferc staff recommended that ferc issue a show cause order to a number of companies  including calpine  regarding certain power scheduling practices that may have been be in violation of the caiso s or calpx s tariff 
the final report also recommended that ferc modify the basis for determining potential liability in the california refund proceeding discussed above 
calpine believes that it did not violate these tariffs and that  to the extent that such a finding could be made  any potential liability would not be material 

table of contents also  on june   ferc issued a number of orders associated with these investigations  including the issuance of two show cause orders to certain industry participants 
ferc did not subject calpine to either of the show cause orders 
ferc also issued an order directing the ferc office of markets and investigations to investigate further whether market participants who bid a price in excess of per megawatt hour into markets operated by either the caiso or the calpx during the period of may   to october   may have violated caiso and calpx tariff prohibitions 
no individual market participant was identified 
we believe that we did not violate the caiso and calpx tariff prohibitions referred to by ferc in this order  however  we are unable to predict at this time the final outcome of this proceeding or its impact on calpine 
cpuc proceeding regarding qf contract pricing for past periods 
our qf contracts with pg e provide that the cpuc has the authority to determine the appropriate utility avoided cost to be used to set energy payments for certain qf contracts by determining the short run avoided cost srac energy price formula 
in mid our qf facilities elected the option set forth in section of the california public utility code  which provides qfs the right to elect to receive energy payments based on the calpx market clearing price instead of the price determined by srac 
having elected such option  we were paid based upon the calpx zonal day ahead clearing price calpx price from summer until january   when the calpx ceased operating a day ahead market 
the cpuc has conducted proceedings r 
to determine whether the calpx price was the appropriate price for the energy component upon which to base payments to qfs which had elected the calpx based pricing option 
the cpuc at one point issued a proposed decision to the effect that the calpx price was the appropriate price for energy payments under the california public utility code but tabled it  and a final decision has not been issued to date 
therefore  it is possible that the cpuc could order a payment adjustment based on a different energy price determination 
we believe that the calpx price was the appropriate price for energy payments but there can be no assurance that this will be the outcome of the cpuc proceedings 
geysers reliability must run section proceeding 
california independent system operator  california electricity oversight board  public utilities commission of the state of california  pacific gas and electric company  san diego gas electric company  and southern california edison collectively referred to as the buyers coalition filed a complaint on november  at the ferc requesting the commencement of a federal power act section proceeding to challenge one component of a number of separate settlements previously reached on the terms and conditions of reliability must run contracts rmr contracts with certain generation owners  including geysers power company  llc  which settlements were also previously approved by the ferc 
rmr contracts require the owner of the specific generation unit to provide energy and ancillary services when called upon to do so by the iso to meet local transmission reliability needs or to manage transmission constraints 
the buyers coalition has asked ferc to find that the availability payments under these rmr contracts are not just and reasonable 
geysers power company  llc filed an answer to the complaint in november to date  ferc has not established a section proceeding 
the outcome of this litigation and the impact on our business cannot be determined at the present time 
government regulation we are subject to complex government regulation which could adversely affect our operations 
our activities are subject to complex and stringent energy  environmental and other governmental laws and regulations 
the construction and operation of power generation facilities and oil and gas exploration and production require numerous permits  approvals and certificates from appropriate foreign  federal  state and local governmental agencies  as well as compliance with environmental protection legislation and other regulations 
while we believe that we have obtained the requisite approvals and permits for our existing operations and that our business is operated in accordance with applicable laws  we remain subject to a varied and complex body of laws and regulations that both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce 
existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  or new laws and regulations may become applicable to us that may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we may be unable to obtain all necessary licenses  permits  approvals and certificates for proposed projects  and completed facilities may not comply with all applicable permit conditions  statutes or regulations 
in addition  regulatory 
table of contents compliance for the construction of new facilities is a costly and time consuming process 
intricate and changing environmental and other regulatory requirements may necessitate substantial expenditures to obtain permits 
if a project is unable to function as planned due to changing requirements or local opposition  it may create expensive delays or significant loss of value in a project 
environmental regulations have had and will continue to have an impact on our cost of doing business and our investment decisions 
for example  the existing market based cap and trade emissions allowance system in texas requires operators to either reduce nitrogen oxide nox emissions or purchase additional nox allowances in the marketplace 
rather than purchase additional allowances  we have chosen to install additional nox emission controls as part of a million steam capacity upgrade at our texas city facility and to retrofit our clear lake  texas facility with similar technology at a cost of approximately million 
these new emission control systems will allow us to meet our thermal customers needs while reducing the need to purchase allowances for our facilities in texas 
our operations are potentially subject to the provisions of various energy laws and regulations  including purpa  puhca  the fpa  and state and local regulations 
puhca provides for the extensive regulation of public utility holding companies and their subsidiaries 
purpa provides qfs as defined under purpa and owners of qfs exemptions from certain federal and state regulations  including rate and financial regulations 
the fpa regulates wholesale sales of power  as well as electric transmission in interstate commerce 
under current federal law  we are not subject to regulation as a holding company under puhca  and will not be subject to such regulation as long as the plants in which we have an interest qualify as qfs  are subject to another exemption or waiver or qualify as an ewg under the energy policy act of in order to be a qf  a facility must be not more than owned by one or more electric utility companies or electric utility holding companies 
generally  any geothermal power facility which produces up to megawatts of electricity and meets purpa ownership requirements is considered a qf 
in addition  a qf that is a cogeneration facility  such as the plants in which we currently have interests  must produce electricity as well as thermal energy for use in an industrial or commercial process in specified minimum proportions 
the qf also must meet certain minimum energy efficiency standards 
if any of the plants in which we have an interest lose their qf status or if amendments to purpa are enacted that substantially reduce the benefits currently afforded qfs  we could become a public utility holding company  which could subject us to significant federal  state and local regulation  including rate regulation 
if we become a holding company  which could be deemed to occur prospectively or retroactively to the date that any of our plants loses its qf status  all of our other power plants could lose qf status because  under ferc regulations  a qf cannot be owned by an electric utility or electric utility holding company 
in addition  a loss of qf status could  depending on the particular power purchase agreement  allow the power purchaser to cease taking and paying for electricity or to seek refunds of past amounts paid and thus could cause the loss of some or all contract revenues or otherwise impair the value of a project 
if a power purchaser were to cease taking and paying for electricity or seek to obtain refunds of past amounts paid  there can be no assurance that the costs incurred in connection with the project could be recovered through sales to other purchasers 
such events could adversely affect our ability to service our indebtedness 
see item business government regulation federal energy regulation federal power act regulation 
a cogeneration qf could lose its qf status if it does not continue to meet ferc s operating and efficiency requirements 
such possible loss of qf status could occur  for example  if the qf s steam host  typically an industrial facility  fails for operating  permit or economic reasons to use sufficient quantities of the qf s steam output 
we cannot assure you that any of our steam hosts will continue to take and use sufficient quantities of their respective qf s steam output 
currently  congress is considering proposed legislation that would repeal puhca  and would amend purpa by limiting its mandatory purchase obligation to existing contracts in those regions of the country that are found to have competitive energy markets 
in light of the circumstances in california  the pg e bankruptcy and the enron corp 
enron bankruptcy  among other events in recent years  there are a number of federal legislative and regulatory initiatives that could result in changes in how the energy markets are regulated 
we do not know whether this legislation or regulatory initiatives will be adopted or  if adopted  
table of contents what form they may take 
we cannot provide assurance that any legislation or regulation ultimately adopted would not adversely affect our existing domestic projects 
in addition  many states are implementing or considering regulatory initiatives designed to increase competition in the domestic power generation industry and increase access to electric utilities transmission and distribution systems for independent power producers and electricity consumers 
however  in light of the circumstances in the california power markets and the bankruptcies of both pg e and enron  the pace and direction of further deregulation at the state level in many jurisdictions is uncertain 
see california power market risk factors 
other risk factors we depend on our management and employees 
our success is largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our people 
while we believe that we have excellent depth throughout all levels of management and in all key skill levels of our employees  the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with critical skills could have a negative effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations and future growth 
seismic disturbances could damage our projects 
areas where we operate and are developing many of our geothermal and gas fired projects are subject to frequent low level seismic disturbances 
more significant seismic disturbances are possible 
our existing power generation facilities are built to withstand relatively significant levels of seismic disturbances  and we believe we maintain adequate insurance protection 
however  earthquake  property damage or business interruption insurance may be inadequate to cover all potential losses sustained in the event of serious seismic disturbances 
additionally  insurance for these risks may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
our results are subject to quarterly and seasonal fluctuations 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future as a result of a number of factors  including without limitation seasonal variations in energy prices  variations in levels of production  the timing and size of acquisitions  and the completion of development projects 
additionally  because we receive the majority of capacity payments under some of our power sales agreements during the months of may through october  our revenues and results of operations are  to some extent  seasonal 
the ultimate outcome of the legal proceedings relating to our activities cannot be predicted 
any adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are party to various litigation matters arising out of the normal course of business  the more significant of which are summarized in item legal proceedings 
these matters include securities class action lawsuits  such as hawaii structural ironworkers pension fund v 
calpine et al  which relates to our april equity offering and also named the underwriters of that offering as defendants 
the ultimate outcome of each of these matters cannot presently be determined  nor can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome be reasonably estimated presently for every case 
the liability we may ultimately incur with respect to any one of these matters in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently accrued with respect to such matters and  as a result  these matters may potentially be material to our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the price of our common stock is volatile 
the market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past  and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future 
these factors include without limitation general conditions in our industry  the power markets in which we participate  or the worldwide economy  announcements of developments related to our business or sector  fluctuations in our results of operations  our debt to equity ratios and other leverage ratios  effects of significant events relating to the energy sector in general  sales of substantial amounts of our securities into the marketplace  an outbreak of war or hostilities  a shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  and announcements of new acquisitions or development projects by us 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future  and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance 
general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock  and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices

in addition  a fifteenth securities class action  ser v

however  the ser action is brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of calpine s senior notes due february  notes and the alleged class period is october  through december  the ser complaint alleges that  in violation of sections and of the securities act of  the supplemental prospectus for the notes contained false and misleading statements regarding calpine s financial condition 
this action names calpine  certain of its officers and directors  and the underwriters of the notes offering as defendants  and seeks an unspecified amount of damages  in addition to other forms of relief 
all fifteen of these securities class action lawsuits were consolidated in the us district court for the northern district court of california 
the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint in october the amended complaint did not include the act complaints raised in the bondholders complaint  and the number of defendants named was reduced 
on january   before our response was due to this amended complaint  the plaintiffs filed a further second complaint 
this second amended complaint added three additional calpine executives and arthur andersen llp as defendants 
the second amended complaint set forth additional alleged violations of section of the securities exchange act of relating to allegedly false and misleading statements made regarding calpine s role in the california energy crisis  the long term power contracts with the california department of water resources  and calpine s dealings with enron  and additional claims under section and section of the securities act of relating to statements regarding the causes of the california energy crisis

calpine  et al 
a securities class action  hawaii structural ironworkers pension fund v 
calpine  et al  was filed on march   against calpine  its directors and certain investment banks in the california superior court  san diego county 
the underlying allegations in the hawaii structural ironworkers pension fund action hawaii action are substantially the same as the federal securities class actions described above 
however  the hawaii action is brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of calpine s equity securities sold to public investors in its april equity offering 
the hawaii action alleges that the registration statement and prospectus filed by calpine which became effective on april   contained false and misleading statements regarding calpine s financial condition in violation of sections  and of the securities act of the hawaii action relies in part on calpine s restatement of certain past financial results  announced on march   to support its allegations 
the hawaii action seeks an unspecified amount of damages  in addition to other forms of relief 
we removed the hawaii action to federal court in april and filed a motion to transfer the case for consolidation with the other securities class action lawsuits in the us district court northern district court of california in may the plaintiff sought to have the action remanded to state court  and on august   the us district court for the southern district of california granted plaintiff s motion to remand the action to state court

the phelps action seeks an unspecified amount of damages  in addition to other forms of relief 
in may lennette poor herena  another participant in the k plan  filed a substantially similar class action lawsuit as the phelps action also in the northern district of california

calpine corporation v 
automated credit exchange 
on march   calpine sued automated credit exchange ace in the superior court of the state of california for the county of alameda for negligence and breach of contract to recover reclaim trading credits  a form of emission reduction credits that should have been held in calpine s account with us trust company us trust 
calpine wrote off million in december related to losses that it alleged were caused by ace 
calpine and ace entered into a settlement agreement on march   pursuant to which ace made a payment to calpine of million and transferred to calpine the rights to the emission reduction credits to be held by ace 
we recognized the million as income in the second quarter of in june a complaint was filed by intergen north america  lp intergen against anne m 
sholtz  the owner of ace  and eonxchange  another sholtz controlled entity  which filed for bankruptcy protection on may  intergen alleges it suffered a loss of emission reduction credits from eonxchange in a manner similar to calpine s loss from ace 
intergen s complaint alleges that anne sholtz co mingled assets among ace  eonxchange and other sholtz entities and that ace and other sholtz entities should be deemed to be one economic enterprise and all retroactively included in the eonxchange bankruptcy filing as of may  by a judgment entered on october   the bankruptcy court consolidated ace and the other sholtz controlled entities with the bankruptcy estate of eonxchange 
subsequently  the trustee of eonxchange filed a separate motion to substantively consolidate anne sholtz into the bankruptcy estate of eonxchange 
although anne sholtz initially opposed such motion  she entered into a settlement agreement with the trustee consenting to her being substantively consolidated into the bankruptcy proceeding 
the bankruptcy court entered an order approving anne sholtz s settlement agreement with the trustee on april  on july   howard grobstein  the trustee in the eonxchange bankruptcy  filed a complaint for avoidance against calpine  seeking recovery of the million plus interest and costs paid to calpine in the march  settlement agreement 
the complaint claims that the million received by calpine in the settlement agreement was transferred within days of the filing of bankruptcy and therefore should be avoided and preserved for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate 
on august   calpine filed its answer denying that the million is an avoidable preference 
discovery is currently ongoing 
calpine believes that it has valid defenses to this claim and will vigorously defend against this complaint 
on january   calpine filed a motion for partial summary judgment asserting that the bankruptcy court did not properly consolidate anne sholtz into the bankruptcy estate of eonxchange 
if the motion is granted  at least million of the million that the trustee is seeking to recover from calpine could not be avoided as a preferential transfer 
we believe we have adequately reserved for the possible loss  if any  it may ultimately incur as a result of this matter 
international paper company v 
androscoggin energy llc 
in october international paper company ip filed a complaint in the federal district court for the northern district of illinois against 
table of contents androscoggin energy llc aellc alleging that aellc breached certain contractual representations and warranties by failing to disclose facts surrounding the termination  effective may   of one of aellc s fixed cost gas supply agreements 
we had acquired a interest in aellc as part of the skygen transaction which closed in october aellc filed a counterclaim against ip that has been referred to arbitration 
aellc may commence the arbitration counterclaim after discovery has progressed further 
on november   the court issued an opinion on the parties cross motions for summary judgment finding in aellc s favor on certain matters though granting summary judgment to ip on the liability aspect of a particular claim against aellc 
the court also denied a motion submitted by ip for preliminary injunction to permit ip to make payment of funds into escrow not directly to aellc and require aellc to post a significant bond 
in mid april of ip unilaterally availed itself to self help in withholding amounts in excess of million as a set off for litigation expenses and fees incurred to date as well as an estimated portion of a rate fund to aellc 
upon aellc s amended complaint and request for immediate injunctive relief against such actions  the court ordered that ip must pay the approximately million withheld as attorneys fees related to the litigation as any such perceived entitlement was premature  but deferred to provide injunctive relief on the incomplete record concerning the offset of  as an estimated pass through of the rate fund 
ip complied with the order on april   and tendered payment to aellc of the approximately million 
on june   the court entered an order dismissing aellc s amended counterclaim without prejudice to aellc refiling the claims as breach of contract claims in a separate lawsuit 
on june   aellc filed a motion to reconsider the order dismissing aellc s amended counterclaim 
on december   the court denied in part ip s summary judgment motion pertaining to damages 
in short  the court i determined that  as a matter of law  ip is entitled to pursue an action for damages as a result of aellc s breach  and ii ruled that sufficient questions of fact remain to deny ip summary judgment on the measure of damages as ip did not sufficiently establish causation resulting from aellc s breach of contract the liability aspect of which ip obtained a summary judgment in december 
on february   the parties filed a pretrial order with the court 
the case appears likely scheduled for trial in the second quarter of  subject to the court s discretion and calendar 
we believe we have adequately reserved for the possible loss  if any  we may ultimately incur as a result of this matter 
pacific gas and electric company v 
calpine corporation  et al

the complaint also seeks an order directing defendants to pay to pg e any underpayments of pg e s tariffed transportation rates and to make restitution for any profits earned from any business activity related to lgs direct interconnections to any entity other than pg e 
the complaint further alleges that various natural gas consumers  including calpine affiliated generation projects within california  are engaged with defendants in the acts complained of  and that the defendants unlawfully bypass pg e s system and operate as an unregulated local distribution company within pg e s service territory 
on august   calpine filed its answer and a motion to dismiss 
lgs has also made similar filings 
on october   the presiding administrative law judge denied the motion to dismiss and on october   issued a scoping memo and ruling establishing a procedural schedule and set the matter for an evidentiary hearing 
although calpine has denied the allegations in the complaint and believes this complaint to be without merit  on january   calpine  lgs and pg e executed a settlement agreement to resolve all outstanding allegations and claims raised in the complaint 
certain aspects of the settlement agreement are effective immediately and the effectiveness of other provisions is subject to the approval of the settlement agreement by the cpuc  in the event the cpuc fails to approve the settlement agreement  its operative terms and conditions become null and void 
the settlement agreement provides  in part  for pg e to be paid million  the disconnection of the lgs interconnections with calpine  calpine to obtain pg e consent or regulatory or other governmental approval before resuming any sales or 
table of contents exchanges at the ryer island meter station  pg e s withdrawal of its public utility claims against calpine  and no party admitting any wrongdoing

and netted purchases of power against sales of purchased power 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our application of eitf issue no 

table of contents the primary reasons for the significant levels of these sales and costs of revenue items include a significant levels of hedging  balancing and optimization activities by our ces risk management organization  b particularly volatile markets for electricity and natural gas  which prompted us to frequently adjust our hedge positions by buying power and gas and reselling it  c the accounting requirements under staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no

generally accepted accounting principles required us to account for this activity  which applies to three of our merchant generating facilities  as the aggregate of two distinct sales and one purchase until our prospective adoption of eitf issue no

see the notes to the consolidated financial statements and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition results of operation for additional information 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our core business and primary source of revenue is the generation and delivery of electric power 
we provide power to our us  canadian and us customers through the development and construction or acquisition  and operation of efficient and environmentally friendly electric power plants fueled primarily by natural gas and  to a much lesser degree  by geothermal resources 
we own and produce natural gas and to a lesser extent oil  which we use primarily to lower our costs of power production and provide a natural hedge of fuel costs for our electric power plants  but also to generate some revenue through sales to third parties 
we protect and enhance the value of our electric and gas assets with a sophisticated risk management organization 
we also protect our power generation assets and control certain of our costs by producing certain of the combustion turbine replacement parts that we use at our power plants  and we generate revenue by providing combustion turbine parts to third parties 
finally  we offer services to third parties to capture value in the skills we have honed in building  commissioning and operating power plants 
our key opportunities and challenges include preserving and enhancing our liquidity while spark spreads the differential between power revenues and fuel costs are depressed  selectively adding new load serving entities and power users to our satisfied customer list as we increase our power contract portfolio  and continuing to add value through prudent risk management and optimization activities 

table of contents since the latter half of  there has been a significant contraction in the availability of capital for participants in the energy sector 
this has been due to a range of factors  including uncertainty arising from the collapse of enron corp 
and a perceived near term surplus supply of electric generating capacity 
these factors have continued through and into  during which decreased spark spreads have adversely impacted our liquidity and earnings 
while we have been able to continue to access the capital and bank credit markets on attractive terms  we recognize that the terms of financing available to us in the future may not be attractive 
to protect against this possibility and due to current market conditions  we scaled back our capital expenditure program to enable us to conserve our available capital resources 
we have recently completed the refinancing of calpine generating company calgen  formerly ccfc ii revolving construction facility indebtedness of approximately billion as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
remaining debt maturities are relatively modest in and as shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
set forth below are the results of operations for the years ending december    and results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  in millions  except for unit pricing information  percentages and mw volumes 
revenue change change total revenue the increase in total revenue is explained by category below 
change change electricity and steam revenue sales of purchased power for hedging and optimization total electric generation and marketing revenue electricity and steam revenue increased as we completed construction and brought into operation new baseload power plants  new peaker facilities and project expansions in average megawatts in operation of our consolidated plants increased by to  mw while generation increased by 
the increase in generation lagged behind the increase in average mw in operation as our baseload capacity factor dropped to in from in primarily due to the increased occurrence of unattractive off peak market spark spreads in certain areas  and to a lesser extent due to unscheduled outages caused by equipment problems at certain of our plants in the first half of average realized electricity prices  before the effects of hedging  balancing and optimization  increased to mwh in from mwh in sales of purchased power for hedging and optimization decreased during  due primarily to adoption of eitf issue no 
and lower realized prices on term power hedges 
change change oil and gas sales sales of purchased gas for hedging and optimization total oil and gas production and marketing revenue oil and gas sales are net of internal consumption  which is eliminated in consolidation 
internal consumption increased by to in before intercompany eliminations  oil and gas sales increased by to in from in due primarily to higher average realized natural gas pricing in 
table of contents sales of purchased gas for hedging and optimization increased during due to higher prices for natural gas 
change change realized gain on power and gas transactions  net unrealized loss on power and gas transactions  net mark to market activities  net realized revenue on power and gas mark to market activity represents the portion of mark to market contracts actually settled 
mark to market activities  which are shown on a net basis  results from general market price movements against our open commodity derivative positions  including positions accounted for as trading under eitf issue no 
 issues related to accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf issue no 
and other mark to market activities 
these commodity positions represent a small portion of our overall commodity contract position 
realized revenue represents the portion of contracts actually settled  while unrealized revenue represents changes in the fair value of open contracts  and the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges 
the decrease in mark to market activities revenue in is due primarily to a reduction in value of option contracts associated with a spark spread protection arrangement for the ccfc i financing and a decline in the value of a long term spark spread option contract accounted for on a mark to market basis under sfas no 
change change other revenue other revenue increased during primarily due to a reduction in liability in connection with our settlement with enron  primarily related to the termination of commodity contracts following the enron bankruptcy 
we also realized of revenue from thomassen turbine systems tts  which we acquired in february power systems mfg  llc psm revenues increased in as compared to cost of revenue change change total cost of revenue the increase in total cost of revenue is explained by category below 
change change plant operating expense royalty expense purchased power expense for hedging and optimization total electrical generation and marketing expense plant operating expense increased due to new baseload power plants  new peaker facilities and expansion projects completed during additionally  we experienced higher transmission expenses and higher maintenance expense as several newer plants underwent their first scheduled hot gas path overhauls which generally first occur after a plant has been in operation for three years 
royalty expense increased primarily due to an increase in electric revenues at the geysers geothermal plants 

table of contents the increase in purchased power expense for hedging and optimization was due primarily to increased spot market costs to purchase power for hedging and optimization activities partially offset by the adoption of eitf issue no 
change change oil and gas production expense oil and gas exploration expense oil and gas operating expense purchased gas expense for hedging and optimization total oil and gas operating and marketing expense oil and gas production expense increased primarily due to higher production taxes and higher gas treating and transportation costs  which were primarily the result of higher oil and gas prices plus an increase in operating cost and an increase in the average canadian dollar foreign exchange rate in oil and gas exploration expense increased primarily as a result of in dry hole drilling expenses in compared to in purchased gas expense for hedging and optimization increased during due to higher prices for gas in change change fuel expense fuel expense increased in  due to a increase in gas fired megawatt hours generated and higher prices excluding the effects of hedging  balancing and optimization 
this was partially offset by an increased value of internally produced gas  which is eliminated in consolidation 
change change depreciation  depletion and amortization expense depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased in primarily due to additional power facilities in consolidated operations subsequent to additionally  in we incurred in accelerated depletion expense for oil and gas impairment charges compared to in change change operating lease expense operating lease expense was flat as the number of operating leases did not change in as compared to change change other cost of revenue approximately half of this increase is due to of tts expense 
tts was acquired in february so there is no comparable expense in the prior period 
additionally  psm expense increased in as compared to due primarily to an increase in sales 
income expenses change change income from unconsolidated investments in power projects and oil and gas properties the increase in income is primarily due to a gain recognized on the termination of the tolling agreement with aquila merchant services  inc ams on the acadia energy center see note of the 
table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we realized a pre tax gain of from the sale of our interest in the gordonsville energy center to dominion virginia power 
change change equipment cancellation and impairment cost in the pre tax equipment cancellation and impairment charge was primarily a result of cancellation costs related to three turbines and three heat recovery steam generators and impairment charges related to four turbines 
the pre tax charge of in was the result of turbine and other equipment order cancellation charges and related write offs as a result of our scale back in construction and development activities 
for further information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
change change long term service agreement cancellation charges of the in charges incurred in  occurred as a result of the cancellation of long term service agreements with general electric related to our rumford  tiverton and westbrook facilities 
the other occurred as a result of the cancellation of long term service agreements with siemens westinghouse power corporation related to our sutter  south point  hermiston and ontelaunee facilities 
change change project development expense project development expense decreased as we placed certain existing development projects on hold and scaled back new development activity 
additionally  write offs of terminated and suspended development projects decreased to in from in change change sales  general and administrative expense sales  general and administrative expense increased due to of stock based compensation expense associated with our adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  effective january   on a prospective basis 
of the increase is attributable to the acquisition of tts in february other causes of the increase include an increase of in insurance costs and an increase in write off of excess office space of sales  general and administrative expense expressed per mwh of generation increased to mwh in from mwh in  due to a lower average capacity factor in change change interest expense interest expense increased primarily due to the new plants entering commercial operations at which point capitalization of interest expense ceases 
interest capitalized decreased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  we expect that interest expense will continue to increase and the amount of interest capitalized will decrease in future periods as our plants in construction are completed  and  to a lesser extent  as a result of suspension of certain of our development projects and suspension of capitalization of interest thereon 
the remaining increase relates to an increase in average indebtedness  an increase in the amortization of terminated interest rate swaps and the recording of interest expense on debt to the three calpine capital trusts due to the adoption of fin r prospectively on october  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our adoption of fin r 
change change distributions on trust preferred securities as a result of the deconsolidation of the three calpine capital trusts upon adoption of fin r as of october   the distributions paid on the trust preferred securities during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents were no longer recorded on our books and were replaced by interest expense on our debt to the calpine capital trusts  thus explaining the decrease in distributions on trust preferred securities in change change interest income the decrease is primarily due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in change change minority interest expense the increase is primarily due to an increase of of minority interest expense associated with the calpine power income fund cpif  which had an initial public offering in august during  as a result of a secondary offering of calpine s interests in cpif  calpine decreased its ownership interests in february to  thus increasing minority interest expense 
additionally  prior to fourth quarter of  we presented minority interest expense on cpif net of taxes  but we reclassed of tax benefit from minority interest expense to tax expense in the fourth quarter of  thus increasing minority interest expense by that amount 
change change income from repurchase of various issuances of debt the pre tax gain of was recorded in connection with the repurchase of various issuances of debt at a discount 
in the primary contribution was a gain of from the receipt of senior notes  which were trading at a discount to face value  as partial consideration for british columbia asset sales 
change change other income other income during is comprised primarily of gains of on the sale of oil and gas assets to calpine natural gas trust and from the termination of a power contract at our rockgen energy center 
this income was offset primarily by of foreign exchange translation losses and of letter of credit fees 
the foreign exchange translation losses recognized into income were mainly due to a strong canadian dollar during in the primary contribution to other income was a gain on the termination of a power sales agreement 
change change benefit for income taxes during the effective tax rate increased to from from this effective rate variance is due to the inclusion of significant permanent items in the calculation of the effective rate  which are fixed in amount and have a significant effect on the effective tax rates as such items become more material to net income 
change change discontinued operations  net of tax the discontinued operations activity included the effects of an agreement to sell our interest in the lost pines energy center  the sale of our alvin south field oil and gas assets and the sale of our specialty data center engineering business  reflecting the soft market for data centers for the foreseeable future 
the sale of the lost pines energy center closed in january the discontinued operations activity included the lost pines energy center  alvin south field oil and gas assets  our specialty data center engineering business  and the depere energy center  as well as the drakes bay field  british columbia and medicine river oil and gas assets 
with the exception of the lost pines energy center  alvin south field oil and gas assets and our specialty data center engineering business  the sales of these assets were completed by

accounting for asset retirement obligations 
net income change change net income our growing portfolio of operating power generation facilities contributed to a increase in electric generation production for the year ended december   compared to the same period in electric generation and marketing revenue increased for the year ended december   as electricity and steam revenue increased by  or  as a result of the higher production and higher electricity prices 
this was partially offset by a decline in sales of purchased power for hedging and optimization 
operating results for the year ended december   reflect a decrease in average spark spreads per megawatt hour compared with the same period in while we experienced an increase in realized electricity prices in  this was more than offset by higher fuel expense 
at the same time  higher realized oil and gas pricing resulted in an increase in oil and gas production margins compared to the prior period 
in we recorded other revenue of in connection with our settlement with enron  primarily related to the termination of commodity contracts following the enron bankruptcy 
plant operating expense  interest expense and depreciation were higher due to the additional plants in operation 
gross profit for the year ended december   decreased approximately  compared to the same period in during overall financial results significantly benefited from of net pre tax gains recorded in connection with the repurchase of various issuances of debt and preferred securities at a discount  and a gain of from the termination of the ams power contract at the acadia energy center  a gain of from the termination of a power contract at the rockgen energy center  a gain of from the sale of oil and gas assets to the calpine natural gas trust and an after tax gain of due to the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle

the increase in generation lagged behind the increase in average mw in operation as our baseload capacity factor dropped to in from in primarily because we operated fewer hours  especially in off peak periods  than in  due to the increased occurrence of unattractive market spark spreads in certain areas 
the overall increase in generation was partially offset by lower average pricing  which dropped as average realized electricity prices  before the effects of hedging  balancing and optimization  declined to mwh in from mwh in sales of purchased power for hedging and optimization decreased during  due to lower power prices and increased industry wide credit restrictions on risk management activities in change change oil and gas sales sales of purchased gas for hedging and optimization total oil and gas production and marketing revenue oil and gas sales are net of internal consumption  which increased by to in internal consumption is eliminated in consolidation 
additionally oil and gas sales were reduced by reclassification of in and in to discontinued operations for assets sold 
before inter company eliminations and reclassifications to discontinued operations  oil and gas sales decreased by due primarily to lower average realized natural gas pricing in sales of purchased gas for hedging and optimization increased during as we brought into operation new generation and the related level of physical gas optimization and balancing activity increased to support the new generation 
change change realized gain on power and gas transactions  net unrealized gain loss on power and gas transactions  net total mark to market activities  net realized revenue on power and gas trading and other mark to market activity represents the portion of contracts actually settled 
in the year ended december   we recognized a net unrealized mark to market gain of from power contracts in a market area where we did not have generation assets and approximately of gains from various other power and gas transactions 
the shift from unrealized mark to market gain in to unrealized loss in reflects increased industry wide credit and liquidity restrictions on risk management and trading activities  which caused us to greatly curtail trading activities so that our available capacity could be concentrated on hedging activities associated with our existing physical power and gas assets 
also  in we 
table of contents established liquidity reserves of approximately against unrealized mark to market revenue to take into account reduced liquidity and the resulting increase in bid ask spreads in the energy industry 
change change other revenue the decrease in is due primarily to one time license fee revenue of recognized in by our wholly owned subsidiary psm and due to in commissioning services in related to an unconsolidated construction project 
cost of revenue change change total cost of revenue the increase in total cost of revenue is explained by category below 
change change plant operating expense royalty expense purchased power expense for hedging and optimization total electrical generation and marketing expense plant operating expense increased due to new baseload power plants  new peaker facilities and expansion projects completed during  but  expressed per mwh of generation  it decreased from mwh to mwh as economies of scale were realized due to the increase in the average size of our plants 
royalty expense decreased due to a decrease in revenue at the geysers geothermal plants due to lower electricity prices 
the decrease in purchased power expense for hedging and optimization was caused by lower power prices and by increased industry wide credit restrictions on risk management activities in change change oil and gas production expense oil and gas exploration expense oil and gas operating expense purchased gas expense for hedging and optimization total oil and gas operating and marketing expense oil and gas production expense increased primarily due to increases in gas treating and transportation costs coupled with higher lifting costs due to a increase in equivalent volumes and due to inflation 
oil and gas exploration expense increased as we incurred in dry hole drilling expenses in compared to in purchased gas expense for hedging and optimization increased during as we brought into operation new generation and the related level of physical gas optimization and balancing activity increased to support the new generation 
change change fuel expense 
table of contents fuel expense increased in due to an increase in gas fired megawatt hours generated which was partially offset by significantly lower gas prices  increased usage of internally produced gas and an improved average heat rate of our generation portfolio in change change depreciation  depletion and amortization expense depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased primarily due to additional power facilities in consolidated operations during as compared to change change operating lease expense operating lease expense increased due to the rockgen  aidlin and south point sale leaseback transactions entered into during change change other cost of revenue the decrease is primarily due to less expense at psm  as combustion parts sales to third parties decreased in income expense change change income from unconsolidated investments in power projects and oil and gas properties the modest decrease is primarily due to approximately earned from our investment in the acadia facility  which commenced operations in august  being offset by less revenue from our investment in lockport  which we sold in the first quarter of  losses at androscoggin and grays ferry in due to lower spark spreads  and a decrease in interest income from loans to power projects resulting from the extinguishment of a note from the delta energy center  llc after we acquired the remaining interest in november change change equipment cancellation impairment cost the pre tax charge of in the year ended december   was a result of turbine and other equipment order cancellation charges and related write offs as a result of our revised construction and development program 
for further information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
change change project development expense project development expense increased primarily because we expensed of previously capitalized costs due to the cancellation or indefinite suspension of certain development projects 
additionally  we stopped capitalizing costs on certain development projects placed on hold 
change change sales  general and administrative expense the increase was attributable to continued growth in personnel and associated overhead costs necessary to support the overall growth in our operations 
in addition we incurred of severance costs and the write off of excess office space due to the reduction of our work force during sales  general and administrative expense expressed per mwh of generation decreased to mwh in from mwh in change change merger expense 
table of contents the merger expense of in the year ended december   was a result of the pooling of interests transaction with encal energy ltd 
that closed on april  change change interest expense interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of the convertible senior notes due and additional senior notes issued in the second half of and due to the new plants entering commercial operations at which point capitalization of interest expense ceases 
interest capitalized increased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december   due to a larger construction portfolio during most of we expect that interest expense will continue to increase and the amount of interest capitalized will decrease in future periods as our plants in construction are completed  and  to a lesser extent  as a result of suspension of certain of our development projects and suspension of capitalization of interest thereon 
change change interest income the decrease in interest income is due primarily to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in change change income from the repurchase of various issuances of debt in the primary contribution was the recognition of of net pre tax gain from the receipt of senior notes  which were trading at a discount to face value  as partial consideration for british columbia asset sales 
in the represents the net pre tax gain on extinguishment of debt from repurchasing aggregate principal amount of our zero coupon convertible debentures due at a discount 
change change other income in the primary contribution to other income was a gain on the termination of a power sales agreement 
in other income resulted from contract settlements and gains from the sales of certain assets 
change change provision benefit for income taxes the decrease is primarily due to the significant decrease in income from continuing operations from to in the income tax benefit was caused by a full year of permanent tax items arising out of our cross border financings in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions 
change change discontinued operations  net of tax the increase in results reflects approximately of gains relating to the sale of oil and gas assets and the depere energy center  partially offset by lower earnings from these discontinued operations as they did not contribute to earnings for the full year in and due to higher gas prices in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
change change cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of tax in the of additional income net of tax of  is due to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

table of contents net income change change net income the decrease in net income reflects a decrease in gross profit resulting primarily from lower spark spreads per mwh  which more than offset the positive effects of the increase in generation volume 
it also reflects lower mark to market revenue in additionally  we recorded in turbine cancellation and impairment charges in  and interest expense increased by as more plants entered commercial operations and interest ceased being capitalized on them at that time 
finally  we experienced higher general and administrative expense in due to the dramatic growth in our operations 
these factors were mitigated by a reduction in income tax expense and a net pre tax gain from receipt of senior notes in consideration for an asset sale discussed above

we have utilized this cash to fund our operations  service or prepay debt obligations  fund acquisitions  develop and construct power generation facilities  finance capital expenditures  support our hedging  balancing  optimization and trading activities at ces  and meet our other cash and liquidity needs 
our strategy is also to reinvest our cash from operations into our business development and construction program or to use it to reduce debt  rather than to pay cash dividends 
as discussed below  we have a liquidity enhancing program underway to fund the completion of our current construction portfolio  for refinancing and for general corporate purposes 
in may and june our million in secured working capital revolving credit facilities matured and were extended  ultimately to july  on july   we closed a billion term loan and second priority senior secured notes offering the july offerings  entered into agreements for a new million working capital facility which is composed of a first priority senior secured two year  million working capital revolver and a first priority senior secured four year  million term loan and repaid the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facilities 
we also repaid the million in funded borrowings outstanding under our billion secured term credit facility which was to mature in may with proceeds of the july offerings 
we have also repurchased nearly billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and high tides in and primarily with proceeds of the july offerings and also through equity swaps 
in november our billion secured revolving construction financing facility through ccfc i was scheduled to mature 
on august   ccfc i and another of our wholly owned subsidiaries  ccfc finance corp  closed on a million institutional term loan and secured notes offering 
on september   ccfc i and ccfc finance corp 
closed on a million secured notes offering  which represented an add on to the secured notes offering completed on august  net proceeds from these offerings were used to refinance the majority of the million outstanding at the date the facility was repaid 
the remainder of that facility was repaid from cash proceeds from the july offerings 
in november our billion secured revolving construction financing facility through our wholly owned subsidiary ccfc ii renamed calgen was scheduled to mature  requiring us to refinance this indebtedness 
as of december   there was billion outstanding under this facility including million of letters of credit 
on march   calgen completed its offering of secured institutional term loans and secured notes  which refinanced the calgen facility 
we realized total proceeds from the offering in the amount of billion  before transaction costs and fees 
see item business recent developments for more information regarding this offering 

table of contents the holders of our convertible senior notes have a right to require us to repurchase them at of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on december  we can effect such a repurchase with cash  shares of calpine stock or a combination of the two 
in and we repurchased in open market and privately negotiated transactions approximately  million of the outstanding principal amount of convertible senior notes  primarily with proceeds of the july offerings and through equity swaps and with the proceeds of our convertible notes offering  and the february   tender offer  in which we initiated a cash tender offer for all of the outstanding convertible senior notes for a price of par plus accrued interest 
approximately million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes were tendered pursuant to the tender offer  which expired on march   for which we paid a total of million  which included accrued interest of million 
currently  convertible senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million remain outstanding 
on november   we priced our separate offerings of convertible notes and second priority senior secured notes 
the latter offering was for million of second priority senior secured notes due  offered at of par 
this offering closed on november  we used the net proceeds from this offering to purchase outstanding senior notes 
the other offering consisted of million of contingent convertible senior notes due  which included the exercise of million of an option to purchase additional convertible notes granted to one of the initial purchasers 
the convertible notes are convertible into cash and shares of calpine common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  which represents a premium on the november  new york stock exchange closing price of per calpine common share 
this offering closed on november  net proceeds from this offering are being used to repurchase our outstanding convertible senior notes 
in addition  on january   we received funding on an additional million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes pursuant to the exercise in full by one of the initial purchasers of its remaining option to purchase additional convertible notes  the net proceeds of which will be used to repurchase our outstanding convertible senior notes pursuant to the tender offer described above 
in addition  million of our outstanding high tides are scheduled to be remarketed no later than november   million of our high tides are scheduled to be remarketed no later than february  and million of our high tides are scheduled to be remarketed no later than august  in the event of a failed remarketing  the relevant high tides will remain outstanding as convertible securities at a term rate equal to the treasury rate plus per annum and with a term conversion price equal to of the average closing price of our common stock for the five consecutive trading days after the applicable final failed remarketing termination date 
while a failed remarketing of our high tides would not have a material effect on our liquidity position  it would impact our calculation of diluted earnings per share and increase our interest expense 
we expect to have sufficient liquidity from cash flow from operations  borrowings available under lines of credit  access to sale leaseback and project financing markets  sale or monetization of certain assets and cash balances to satisfy all obligations under our outstanding indebtedness  and to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next twelve months 
factors that could affect our liquidity and capital resources are also discussed in item business risk factors 

table of contents cash flow activities the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated years ended december  in thousands beginning cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents ending cash and cash equivalents operating activities for the year ended december   provided net cash of million  compared to  million for the same period in the decrease in operating cash flow between periods is primarily due to the working capital funding requirements 
during the year ended december   operating assets and liabilities used approximately million  as compared to having provided million in the same period last year 
the growth in short term assets such as margin deposits and accounts receivable accounted for the majority of this difference 
at december   we had posted million in net margin deposits as compared to million at the end of the increase in such deposits  which serve as collateral for certain of our commodity transactions that are out of the money on a mark to market basis  is reflective of movements in commodity prices and a higher mix of margin deposits posted relative to letters of credit during the dollar value of letters of credit that we posted as collateral for commodity transactions decreased million 
in the increase in the posting of margin deposits constituted a use of funds of million  which compares to a million source of operating cash flow in as a result of the decrease in margin deposits during that year 
the decrease in margin deposits in was primarily the result of increased gas prices  which allowed us to post less collateral on certain of our gas contracts 
accounts receivable grew by million in from year end  representing a use of funds 
although average spark spreads were lower in than in  higher electricity prices and increased electrical generation resulted in higher revenues  and consequently  higher receivables balances 
however  in accounts receivable decreased by million from year end  representing a source of funds as we collected from escrow approximately million in for the pg e past due pre petition receivables that were sold to a third party in december also  in we received million from the acadia joint venture  following the termination of the power purchase agreement with aquila merchant services  inc and the restructuring of our interest in the joint venture  which is included in distributions from unconsolidated investments 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
investing activities for the year ended december   consumed net cash of  million  as compared to  million in the same period of in both periods capital expenditures represent the majority of investing cash outflows 
the decrease between periods is due to the completion of construction on several facilities during and  and due to our revised capital expenditure program  which reduced capital investments in additionally  investing activities for include a use of million for restricted cash  of which approximately million is expected to be used to repay outstanding indebtedness within the next year 
financing activities for the year ended december   provided net cash  million  compared to  million in the prior year 
current year cash inflows are primarily the result of several financing 
table of contents transactions  including billion from the issuance of senior notes  million from the power contract financing  llc pcf financing transaction  million from the refinancing of our ccfc i credit facility  million from the issuance of secured notes by our wholly owned subsidiary gilroy energy center gec llc  million from secondary trust unit offerings from our canadian income trust  million from the monetization of one of our power sales agreements  million  million  and million  respectively  from the sales of preferred interests in the cash flows of our king city  auburndale  and gec holdings  llc facilities and additional borrowings under our revolvers 
this was partially offset by financing costs and billion in debt repayments and repurchases 
we expect that the significant financing transactions will allow us to continue to retire short term debt and will also enable us to make further repurchases of other long term securities 
in the same period of financing inflows were comprised of million from the issuance of common stock  and billion in debt financing  partially offset by the use of million used to repay our zero coupon convertible debentures due  in addition to the repayment of million of other indebtedness 
letter of credit facilities at december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in letters of credit outstanding under various credit facilities to support ces risk management and other operational and construction activities 
of the total letters of credit outstanding  million and million  respectively  were in aggregate issued under the cash collateralized letter of credit facility and the corporate revolving credit facility at december  and  respectively 
ces margin deposits and other credit support as of december  and  ces had deposited net amounts of million and million  respectively  in cash as margin deposits with third parties and had letters of credit outstanding of million and million  respectively 
ces uses these margin deposits and letters of credit as credit support for the gas procurement and risk management activities it conducts on calpine s behalf 
future cash collateral requirements may increase based on the extent of our involvement in derivative activities and movements in commodity prices and also based on our credit ratings and general perception of creditworthiness in this market 
while we believe that we have adequate liquidity to support ces s operations at this time  it is difficult to predict future developments and the amount of credit support that we may need to provide as part of our business operations 
working capital at december   we had a negative working capital balance of approximately billion due primarily to the classification as a current liability of the outstanding ccfc i construction revolving credit facility balance of million  which was successfully refinanced in august revised capital expenditure program following a comprehensive review of our power plant development program  we announced in january the adoption of a revised capital expenditure program which contemplated the completion of power projects representing  mw then under construction 
of these facilities have subsequently achieved full or partial commercial operation as of december  construction of advanced stage development projects is expected to proceed only when there is an established market need for additional generating resources at prices that will allow us to meet our investment criteria  and when capital may again become available to us on attractive terms 
further  our entire development and construction program is flexible and subject to continuing review and revision based upon such criteria 
on march   we announced a new turbine program that reduced previously forecasted capital spending by approximately billion in and billion in the revision includes adjusted timing of turbine delivery and related payment schedules and also cancellation of some orders 
as a result of these turbine cancellations and other equipment cancellations  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the first quarter of on february   we announced a significant restructuring of its turbine agreements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which enables us to cancel up to steam and gas turbines 
we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the quarter ending december   in connection with fees paid to vendors to restructure these contracts 
to date  of these turbines have been canceled  leaving the disposition of turbines still to be determined 

table of contents in july we completed a restructuring of our existing agreements for gas and steam turbines 
the new agreement provides for later payment dates  which are in line with our construction program 
the table in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements sets forth future turbine payments for construction and development projects  as well as for unassigned turbines 
it includes previously delivered turbines  payments and delivery year for the remaining turbines to be delivered as well as payment required for the potential cancellation costs of the remaining gas and steam turbines 
the table in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements does not include payments that would result if we were to release for manufacturing any of these remaining turbines 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding turbine restructuring agreements 
in the pre tax equipment cancellation and impairment charge was primarily a result of the cancellation costs related to three turbines and three heat recovery steam generators totaling million  impairment charges related to four turbines totaling million and storage and suspension costs for unassigned equipment 
uses and sources of funding our estimated uses of funds for are as follows cash interest of billion  committed capital expenditures of billion  discretionary capital expenditures of billion  turbine costs of billion  maintenance capital of billion  principal payments on operating leases and debt of billion and working capital and other miscellaneous uses of billion 
these outflows will be funded primarily through cash on hand cash and cash equivalents  the current portion of restricted cash and funds escrowed for the repurchase of outstanding debt and borrowing capacity under our various credit facilities of billion  estimated ebitda  as adjusted of billion and billion of proceeds from financing transactions 
actual costs for the projected use of funds identified above  and net proceeds from the projected sources of funds identified above could vary from those estimates  potentially in material respects 
in addition  the timing is difficult to predict and we may not be able to complete the financings or we may be able to complete them only on less favorable terms than currently anticipated 
the above reflects the refinancing of the ccfc ii revolving construction financing facility  expiring in  which occurred on march  factors that could affect the accuracy of these estimates include the factors identified at the beginning of this section and under risk factors in item business 
capital availability access to capital for many in the energy sector  including us  has been restricted since late while we have been able to access the capital and bank credit markets  in this new environment it has been on significantly different terms than in the past 
in particular  our senior working capital facility and term loan financings and the majority of our debt securities offered and sold in this period  have been secured by certain of our assets and equity interests 
while we believe we will be successful in refinancing all debt before maturity  the terms of financing available to us now and in the future may not be attractive to us and the timing of the availability of capital is uncertain and is dependent  in part  on market conditions that are difficult to predict and are outside of our control 
at the beginning of  calpine launched a liquidity enhancing and refinancing program  which resulted in us closing approximately billion of transactions such as contract monetizations  sales of non strategic assets  refinancings  and new corporate and project financings 
to date  we have completed in excess of billion of liquidity enhancing transactions  exceeding our original billion goal 
over the past several months in  unless otherwise noted  we completed the million  non recourse project financing facility to fund the construction of our megawatt rocky mountain energy center february 
closed the million monetization of a pg e note receivable  and received million for the sale of our interest in the megawatt gordonsville power plant 

table of contents over the past twelve months  we completed over billion of capital market transactions and successfully refinanced billion of current maturities 
we completed billion of term loan and secured notes offerings the largest high yield financing in the capital markets in seven years  calgen completed its offering of secured institutional term loans and secured notes  totaling billion before transaction costs and fees march  raised an additional million through an add on offering of our secured notes  completed the million ccfc i loan refinancing with a secured note and term loan issuance  and issued million of contingent convertible senior notes due to refinance the convertible senior notes that can be put to calpine in december million of the million issued in 
calpine used proceeds from these offerings to refinance the following the billion working capital revolver that matured in may  the billion ccfc i facility that was scheduled to mature in november the billion in term loans under our senior working capital facility that were scheduled to mature in may  the majority of the billion convertible senior notes  that can be put to calpine in december at december   we had repurchased million of these notes 
subsequent to december   we repurchased approximately million in principal amount of the convertible senior notes in exchange for approximately million in cash 
additionally  on february   we made a cash tender offer  which expired on march   for all of the outstanding convertible senior notes at a price of par plus accrued interest 
on march   we paid an aggregate amount of million for the tendered convertible senior notes which included accrued interest of million 
currently  convertible senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million remain outstanding  and the billion ccfc ii facility that was scheduled to mature in november in with the remaining proceeds from the offerings  we repurchased  million of the principal amount of our outstanding debt and preferred securities in exchange for  million in cash and million shares of calpine common stock valued at approximately million 
as a result  in we realized a net pre tax gain on the repurchase of securities of million  while reducing indebtedness by approximately million 
asset sales as a result of the significant contraction in the availability of capital for participants in the energy sector  we have adopted a strategy of conserving our core strategic assets and disposing of certain less strategically important assets  which serves primarily to strengthen our balance sheet through repayment of debt 
set forth below are the completed asset disposals on october   we sold select oil and gas properties located in oklahoma to loto energy  llc for approximately million 
as a result of the sale  we recognized a pre tax gain of million 
on october   we sold select oil and natural gas properties located throughout the province of alberta  canada to calpine natural gas trust  owned indirectly by calpine  for net proceeds of million 
the assets represent approximately billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent net proved reserves  of which approximately percent were crude oil and natural gas liquids 
the properties included  net developed acres and  net undeveloped acres  with approximately net producing wells 

table of contents on november   we completed the sale of our alvin south field oil and gas assets located near alvin  texas for approximately million to cornerstone energy  inc as a result of the sale  we recognized a pre tax loss of million 
on november   we completed the sale of our percent interest in the gordonsville power plant 
under the terms of the transaction  we received million in cash 
we recorded a pre tax gain of million on the sale 
we believe that our completion of the financing and liquidity transactions described above in difficult conditions affecting the market  and our sector in general  demonstrate our probable ability to have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms in the future  although availability of capital has tightened significantly throughout the power generation industry and  therefore  there can be no assurance that we will have access to capital in the future as and when we may desire 
credit considerations on july   standard poor s placed our corporate rating currently rated at b  our senior unsecured debt rating currently at ccc  our preferred stock rating currently at ccc  our bank loan rating currently at b  and our second priority senior secured debt rating currently at b under review for possible downgrade 
on july   fitch  inc downgraded our long term senior unsecured debt rating from b to b with a stable outlook  our preferred stock rating from b to ccc with a stable outlook  and initiated coverage of our senior secured debt rating at bb with a stable outlook 
on october   moody s downgraded the rating of our long term senior unsecured debt from b to caa with a stable outlook and our senior implied rating from ba to b with a stable outlook 
the ratings on our senior unsecured debt  senior unsecured convertible debt and convertible preferred securities were also lowered with a stable outlook from b to caa  from b to caa and from b to caa  respectively 
the moody s downgrade did not impact our credit agreements  and we continue to conduct our business with our usual creditworthy counterparties 
many other issuers in the power generation sector have also been downgraded by one or more of the ratings agencies during this period 
such downgrades can have a negative impact on our liquidity by reducing attractive financing opportunities and increasing the amount of collateral required by trading counterparties

includes expansion of the morgan energy center  which entered commercial operation in january construction in progress cip 
projects in active construction the projects in active construction are estimated to come on line from january to june these projects will bring on line approximately  mw of base load  mw base load with peaking capacity 
interest and other costs related to the construction activities necessary to bring these projects to their intended use are being capitalized 
at december   the estimated funding requirements to complete these projects  net of expected project financing proceeds  is approximately billion 
we plan to spend billion  billion  and billion in   and  respectively  net of project financing 
projects in advanced development there are projects in advanced development 
these projects will bring on line approximately  mw of base load  mw base load with peaking capacity 
interest and other costs related to the development activities necessary to bring these projects to their intended use are being capitalized 
however  the capitalization of interest has been suspended on two projects for which development activities are substantially complete but construction will not commence until a power purchase agreement and financing are obtained 
the estimated cost to complete the projects in advanced development is approximately billion 
our current plan is to project finance these costs as power purchase agreements are arranged 
suspended development projects due to current electric market conditions  we have ceased capitalization of additional development costs and interest expense on certain development projects on which work has been suspended 
capitalization of costs may recommence as work on these projects resumes  if certain milestones and criteria are met indicating that it is again highly probable that the costs will be recovered through future operations 
as is true for all projects  the suspended projects are reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of potential reduction in a project s fair value 
further  if it is determined that it is no longer probable that the projects will be completed and all capitalized costs recovered through future operations  the carrying values of the projects would be written down to the recoverable value 
these projects would bring on line approximately  mw of base load  mw base load with peaking capacity 
the estimated cost to complete these projects is approximately billion 
projects in early development costs for projects that are in early stages of development are capitalized only when it is highly probable that such costs are ultimately recoverable and significant project milestones are achieved 
until then  all costs  including interest costs  are expensed 
the projects in early development with capitalized costs relate to projects and include geothermal drilling costs and equipment purchases 

table of contents other capital projects other capital projects primarily consist of enhancements to operating power plants  oil and gas and geothermal resource and facilities development as well as software developed for internal use 
unassigned equipment as of december   we had made progress payments on turbines  heat recovery steam generator  and other equipment with an aggregate carrying value of million 
this unassigned equipment is classified on the balance sheet as other assets  because it is not assigned to specific development and construction projects 
we are holding this equipment for potential use on future projects 
it is possible that some of this unassigned equipment may eventually be sold  potentially in combination with our engineering and construction services 
for equipment that is not assigned to development or construction projects  interest is not capitalized 
impairment evaluation all construction and development projects and unassigned turbines are reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of potential reduction in fair value 
equipment assigned to such projects is not evaluated for impairment separately  as it is integral to the assumed future operations of the project to which it is assigned 
if it is determined that it is no longer probable that the projects will be completed and all capitalized costs recovered through future operations  the carrying values of the projects would be written down to the recoverable value in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review our unassigned equipment for potential impairment based on probability weighted alternatives of utilizing it for future projects versus selling it 
utilizing this methodology  we do not believe that the equipment not committed to sale is impaired 
however  during year ended december   we recorded approximately million in losses in connection with the sale of four turbines  and we may incur further losses should we decide to sell more unassigned equipment in the future 
performance metrics in understanding our business  we believe that certain non gaap operating performance metrics are particularly important 
these are described below total deliveries of power 
we both generate power that we sell to third parties and purchase power for sale to third parties in hedging  balancing and optimization hbo transactions 
the former sales are recorded as electricity and steam revenue and the latter sales are recorded as sales of purchased power for hedging and optimization 
the volumes in mwh for each are key indicators of our respective levels of generation and hbo activity and the sum of the two  our total deliveries of power  is relevant because there are occasions where we can either generate or purchase power to fulfill contractual sales commitments 
prospectively beginning october   in accordance with eitf  certain sales of purchased power for hedging and optimization are shown net of purchased power expense for hedging and optimization in our consolidated statement of operations 
accordingly  we have also netted hbo volumes on the same basis as of october   in the table below 
average availability and average baseload capacity factor or operating rate 
availability represents the percent of total hours during the period that our plants were available to run after taking into account the downtime associated with both scheduled and unscheduled outages 
the baseload capacity factor  sometimes called operating rate  is calculated by dividing a total megawatt hours generated by our power plants excluding peakers by the product of multiplying b the weighted average megawatts in operation during the period by c the total hours in the period 
the capacity factor is thus a measure of total actual generation as a percent of total potential generation 
if we elect not to generate during periods when electricity pricing is too low or gas prices too high to operate profitably  the baseload capacity factor will reflect that decision as well as both scheduled and unscheduled outages due to maintenance and repair requirements 
average heat rate for gas fired fleet of power plants expressed in btu s of fuel consumed per kwh generated 
we calculate the average heat rate for our gas fired power plants excluding peakers by dividing a fuel consumed in btu s by b kwh generated 
the resultant heat rate is a measure of fuel efficiency  so the lower the heat rate  the better 
we also calculate a steam adjusted heat rate  in 
table of contents which we adjust the fuel consumption in btu s down by the equivalent heat content in steam or other thermal energy exported to a third party  such as to steam hosts for our cogeneration facilities 
our goal is to have the lowest average heat rate in the industry 
average all in realized electric price expressed in dollars per mwh generated 
our risk management and optimization activities are integral to our power generation business and directly impact our total realized revenues from generation 
accordingly  we calculate the all in realized electric price per mwh generated by dividing a adjusted electricity and steam revenue  which includes capacity revenues  energy revenues  thermal revenues and the spread on sales of purchased electricity for hedging  balancing  and optimization activity  by b total generated mwh s in the period 
average cost of natural gas expressed in dollars per millions of btu s of fuel consumed 
our risk management and optimization activities related to fuel procurement directly impact our total fuel expense 
the fuel costs for our gas fired power plants are a function of the price we pay for fuel purchased and the results of the fuel hedging  balancing  and optimization activities by ces 
accordingly  we calculate the cost of natural gas per millions of btu s of fuel consumed in our power plants by dividing a adjusted fuel expense which includes the cost of fuel consumed by our plants adding back cost of intercompany equity gas from calpine natural gas  which is eliminated in consolidation  and the spread on sales of purchased gas for hedging  balancing  and optimization activity by b the heat content in millions of btu s of the fuel we consumed in our power plants for the period 
average spark spread expressed in dollars per mwh generated 
our risk management activities focus on managing the spark spread for our portfolio of power plants  the spread between the sales price for electricity generated and the cost of fuel 
we calculate the spark spread per mwh generated by subtracting a adjusted fuel expense from b adjusted e s revenue and dividing the difference by c total generated mwh in the period 
average plant operating expense per normalized mwh 
to assess trends in electric power plant operating expense pox per mwh  we normalize the results from period to period by assuming a constant total company wide capacity factor including both baseload and peaker capacity in deriving normalized mwh s 
by normalizing the cost per mwh with a constant capacity factor  we can better analyze trends and the results of our program to realize economies of scale  cost reductions and efficiencies at our electric generating plants

table of contents the fair value of outstanding derivative commodity instruments and the fair value that would be expected after a ten percent adverse price change are shown in the table below in thousands fair value after adverse fair value price change at december  electricity natural gas total derivative commodity instruments included in the table are those included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of derivative commodity instruments included in the table is based on present value adjusted quoted market prices of comparable contracts 
the fair value of electricity derivative commodity instruments after a adverse price change includes the effect of increased power prices versus our derivative forward commitments 
conversely  the fair value of the natural gas derivatives after a adverse price change reflects a general decline in gas prices versus our derivative forward commitments 
derivative commodity instruments offset the price risk exposure of our physical assets 
none of the offsetting physical positions are included in the table above 
price changes were calculated by assuming an across the board ten percent adverse price change regardless of term or historical relationship between the contract price of an instrument and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual ten percent change in prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change by more than ten percent for earlier forward months and less than ten percent for later forward months because of the higher volatilities in the near term and the effects of discounting expected future cash flows 
the primary factors affecting the fair value of our derivatives at any point in time are the volume of open derivative positions mmbtu and mwh  and changing commodity market prices  principally for electricity and natural gas 
the total volume of open gas derivative positions decreased from december   to december   while the total volume of open power derivative positions decreased for the same period 
in that prices for electricity and natural gas are among the most volatile of all commodity prices  there may be material changes in the fair value of our derivatives over time  driven both by price volatility and the changes in volume of open derivative transactions 
under sfas no 
 the change since the last balance sheet date in the total value of the derivatives both assets and liabilities is reflected either in other comprehensive income oci  net of tax  or in the statement of operations as an item gain or loss of current earnings 
as of december   the majority of the balance in accumulated oci represented the unrealized net loss associated with commodity cash flow hedging transactions 
as noted above  there is a substantial amount of volatility inherent in accounting for the fair value of these derivatives  and our results during the year ended december   have reflected this

application of critical accounting policies our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
we believe that the following reflect the more critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents fair value of energy marketing and risk management contracts and derivatives gaap requires us to account for certain derivative contracts at fair value 
accounting for derivatives at fair value requires us to make estimates about future prices during periods for which price quotes are not available from sources external to us 
as a result  we are required to rely on internally developed price estimates when external price quotes are unavailable 
our estimates regarding future prices involve a level of uncertainty  and prices actually realized in the future could differ from our estimates 
we derive our future price estimates  during periods where external price quotes are unavailable  based on an extrapolation of prices from periods where external price quotes are available 
we perform this extrapolation using liquid and observable market prices and extending those prices to an internally generated long term price forecast based on a generalized equilibrium model 
we adopted this approach december   for purposes of valuing our commodity derivative instruments 
this valuation technique differs from our historical approach 
historically we had extrapolated forward price curves by extrapolating liquid and observable market prices into future periods based on observed year over year spreads 
while our historical approach was reasonable  we believe the new approach is superior because it incorporates expectations about long range market fundamentals into the extrapolation 
the change did not affect the valuation of the majority of our commodity derivative instruments because of the relative short tenor of those instruments and the fact that the liquid and observable curves under both valuation techniques are the same 
the effect of the change on our longer dated derivative commodity instruments resulted in a million reduction in the value of our derivative assets  million of which was recognized as a charge to mark to market income and million of which was recognized as a gain in other comprehensive income 
credit reserves in estimating the fair value of our derivatives  we must take into account the credit risk that our counterparties will not have the financial wherewithal to honor their contract commitments 
in establishing credit risk reserves we take into account historical default rate data published by the rating agencies based on the credit rating of each counterparty where we have realization exposure  as well as other published data and information 
liquidity reserves we value our forward positions at the mid market price  or the price in the middle of the bid ask spread 
this creates a risk that the value reported by us as the fair value of our derivative positions will not represent the realizable value or probable loss exposure of our derivative positions if we are unable to liquidate those positions at the mid market price 
adjusting for this liquidity risk states our derivative assets and liabilities at their most probable value 
we use a two step quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine our liquidity reserve 
in the first step we quantitatively derive an initial liquidity reserve assessment applying the following assumptions in calculating the initial liquidity reserve assessment where we have the capability to cover physical positions with our own assets  we assume no liquidity reserve is necessary because we will not have to cross the bid ask spread in covering the position  we record no reserve against our hedge positions because a high likelihood exists that we will hold our hedge positions to maturity or cover them with our own assets  and where reserves are necessary  we base the reserves on the spreads observed using broker quotes as a starting point 
using these assumptions  we calculate the net notional volume exposure at each location by commodity and multiply the result by one half of the bid ask spread 
the second step involves a qualitative analysis where the initial assessment may be adjusted for qualitative factors such as liquidity spreads observed through recent trading activity  strategies for liquidating open positions  and imprecision in or unavailability of broker quotes due to market illiquidity 
using this quantitative and qualitative information  we estimate the amount of probable liquidity risk exposure to us and we record this estimate as a liquidity reserve 

table of contents presentation of revenue under eitf no 
during the emerging issues task force the task force discussed eitf issue no 
in eitf issue no 
the task force reached a consensus that companies should present all gains and losses on derivative instruments held for trading purposes net in the income statement  whether or not settled physically 
eitf issue no 
addresses income statement classification of derivative instruments held for other than trading purposes 
at the july   eitf meeting  the task force reached a consensus that determining whether realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not held for trading purposes should be reported on a net or gross basis is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances 
the task force ratified this consensus at its august   meeting  and it is effective beginning october  the task force did not prescribe specific effective date or transition guidance for this issue 
we determined that under the provisions of eitf issue no 
 transactions which are not physically settled should be reported net for purposes of the consolidated statements of operations 
accordingly  transactions with either of the following characteristics are presented net in our financial statements transactions executed in a back to back buy and sale pair  primarily because of market protocols  and physical power purchase and sale transactions where our power schedulers net the physical flow of the power purchase against the physical flow of the power sale book out the physical power flows as a matter of scheduling convenience to eliminate the need to schedule actual power deliveries 
these book out transactions may occur with the same counterparty or between different counterparties where we have equal but offsetting physical purchase and delivery commitments 
based on guidance in eitf topic no 
d implications and implementation of an eitf consensus and because eitf issue no 
is silent with respect to transition provisions  we have adopted eitf no 
on a prospective basis effective october  while adoption of eitf no 
had no effect on our gross profit or net income  it reduced our sales of purchased power for hedging and optimization and purchased power expense for hedging and optimization by approximately million 
accounting for long lived assets plant useful lives property  plant and equipment is stated at cost 
the cost of renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of property  plant and equipment are also capitalized 
depreciation is recorded utilizing the straight line method over the estimated original composite useful life  generally years for baseload power plants and years for peaking facilities  exclusive of the estimated salvage value  typically 
impairment of long lived assets  including intangibles we evaluate long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  equity method investments  patents  and specifically identifiable intangibles  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
certain of our generating assets are located in regions with depressed demands and market spark spreads 
our forecasts assume that spark spreads will increase in future years in these regions as the supply and demand relationships improve 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets  as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
the significant assumptions that we use in our undiscounted future cash flow estimates include the future supply and demand relationships for electricity and natural gas  and the expected pricing for those commodities and the resultant spark spreads in the various regions where we generate 
if an impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment loss recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the fair value was less than the book value 
for equity method investments and assets identified as held for sale  the book value is compared to the estimated fair value to determine if an impairment loss is required 
for equity method investments  we would record a loss when the decline in value is other than temporary 

table of contents our assessment regarding the existence of impairment factors is based on market conditions  operational performance and legal factors of our businesses 
our review of factors present and the resulting appropriate carrying value of our intangibles  and other long lived assets are subject to judgments and estimates that management is required to make 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our intangibles  and other long lived assets might be impaired 
turbine impairment charges a significant portion of our overall cost of constructing a power plant is the cost of the gas turbine generators gtgs  steam turbine generators stgs and related equipment collectively the turbines 
the turbines are ordered primarily from three large manufacturers under long term  build to order contracts 
payments are generally made over a two to four year period for each turbine 
the turbine prepayments are included as a component of construction in progress if the turbines are assigned to specific projects probable of being built  and interest is capitalized on such costs 
turbines assigned to specific projects are not evaluated for impairment separately from the project as a whole 
prepayments for turbines that are not assigned to specific projects that are probable of being built are carried in other assets  and interest is not capitalized on such costs 
additionally  our commitments relating to future turbine payments are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
to the extent that there are more turbines on order than are allocated to specific construction projects  we determine the probability that new projects will be initiated to utilize the turbines or that the turbines will be resold to third parties 
the completion of in progress projects and the initiation of new projects are dependent on our overall liquidity and the availability of funds for capital expenditures 
in assessing the impairment of turbines  we must determine both the realizability of the progress payments to date that have been capitalized  as well as the probability that at future decision dates  we will cancel the turbines  forfeiting the prepayment and incurring the cancellation payment  or will proceed and pay the remaining progress payments in accordance with the original payment schedule 
we apply sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies to evaluate potential future cancellation obligations 
we apply sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets to evaluate turbine progress payments made to date and the carrying value of delivered turbines not assigned to projects 
at the reporting date  if we believe that it is probable that we will elect the cancellation provisions relating to future decision dates  then the expected future termination payment is also expensed 
oil and gas property valuations successful efforts method of accounting 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas activities 
under the successful efforts method  lease acquisition costs and all development costs are capitalized 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized until the results are determined 
if proved reserves are not discovered  the exploratory drilling costs are expensed 
other exploratory costs are expensed as incurred 
interest costs related to financing major oil and gas projects in progress are capitalized until the projects are evaluated  or until the projects are substantially complete and ready for their intended use if the projects are evaluated as successful 
the successful efforts method of accounting relies on management s judgment in the designation of wells as either exploratory or developmental  which determines the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred 
during we drilled net development wells and net exploratory wells  of which net development and net exploration were successful 
our operational results may be significantly impacted if we decide to drill in a new exploratory area  which will result in increased seismic costs and potentially increased dry hole costs if the wells are determined to be not successful 
successful efforts method of accounting v 
full cost method of accounting 
under the successful efforts method  unsuccessful exploration well cost  geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals  and general and administrative expenses directly allocable to acquisition  exploration  and development activities are 
table of contents charged to exploration expense as incurred  whereas  under the full cost method these costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the reserves 
a significant sale would have to occur before a gain or loss would be recognized under the full cost method but  when an entire cost center generally a field is sold under successful efforts method  a gain or loss is recognized 
for impairment evaluation purposes  successful efforts requires that individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  which are generally on a field by field basis 
under full cost impairment review  all properties in the depreciation  depletion and amortization pools are assessed against a ceiling based on discounted cash flows  with certain adjustments 
though successful efforts and full cost methods are both acceptable under gaap  historically successful efforts is used by most major companies due to such method being more reflective of current operating results due to expensing of certain exploration activities 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we review our oil and gas properties periodically to determine if impairment of such properties is necessary 
property impairments may occur if a field discovers lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly affects anticipated future cash flows on the property 
proved oil and gas property values are reviewed when circumstances suggest the need for such a review and  if required  the proved properties are written down to their estimated fair value 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  with any such impairment charged to expense in the current period 
during we recorded approximately million primarily in proved property impairments 
oil and gas reserves 
the process of estimating quantities of proved developed and proved undeveloped crude oil and natural gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of governmental regulations  operating and workover costs  severance taxes and development costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such properties 
we based our estimates of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves as of december   on estimates made by netherland  sewell associates  inc for reserves in the united states  and gilbert laustsen jung associates ltd 
for reserves in canada  both independent petroleum consultants 
capitalized interest we capitalize interest using two methods capitalized interest on funds borrowed for specific construction projects and capitalized interest on general corporate funds 
for capitalization of interest on specific funds  we capitalize the interest cost incurred related to debt entered into for specific projects under construction or in the advanced stage of development 
the methodology for capitalizing interest on general funds  consistent with paragraphs and of sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  begins with a determination of the borrowings applicable to our qualifying assets 
the basis of this approach is the assumption that the portion of the interest costs that are capitalized on expenditures during an asset s acquisition period could have been avoided if the expenditures had not been made 
this methodology takes the view that if funds are not required for construction then they would have been used to pay off other debt 
we use our best judgment in determining which borrowings represent the cost of financing the acquisition of the assets 
the primary debt instruments included in the rate calculation of interest incurred on general corporate funds are our senior notes  our term loan facilities and our secured working capital revolving credit facility 
the interest rate is derived by dividing the total interest cost by the average borrowings 
this weighted average interest rate is applied to our average qualifying assets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the capitalization of interest expense 

table of contents accounting for income taxes to arrive at our worldwide income tax provision significant judgment is required 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of the treatment of capital assets  financing transactions  multistate taxation of operations and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we provide for united states income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside the united states 
at december   we had no cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
our effective income tax rates were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in all periods is the result of profits calpine corporation and its subsidiaries earned in various tax jurisdictions  both foreign and domestic  that apply a broad range of income tax rates 
the provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations and the effect of the treatment by foreign jurisdictions of cross border financings 
future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates  if unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations occur  or if we experience future adverse determinations by taxing authorities after any related litigation 
for calendar year the state tax rate increased over prior years due to a one time adjustment increasing our deferred state taxes and receiving no benefit for foreign losses in our state tax filings 
our foreign taxes at rates other than statutory include the benefit of cross border financings as well as withholding taxes and foreign valuation allowance 
additionally  our effective rate was adversely impacted by the recognition of undistributed foreign income subpart f in our us tax return 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based on the weight of available evidence  we have provided a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was based on the historical earnings patterns within individual tax jurisdictions that make it uncertain that we will have sufficient income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the full value of the assets 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
at december   we had credit carryforwards  resulting in a million tax benefit  which originated from acceleration of deductions on capital assets 
we expect to utilize all of the credit carryforwards 
we also had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire between and the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards available are subject to limitations on annual usage 
in addition  we had loss carryforwards in certain foreign subsidiaries  resulting in a tax benefit of million  the majority of which expire by it is expected that they will be fully utilized before expiring 
the deferred tax asset for the federal and state losses  foreign losses  and other prepaid taxes has been offset by a valuation allowance of million 

table of contents variable interest entities and primary beneficiary in determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie and whether or not we are the primary beneficiary  we use significant judgment regarding the adequacy of an entity s equity relative to maximum expected losses  amounts and timing of estimated cash flows  discount rates and the probability of achieving a specific expected future cash flow outcome for various cash flow scenarios 
due to the long term nature of our investment in a vie and its underlying assets  our estimates of the probability weighted future expected cash flow outcomes are complex and subjective  and are based  in part  on our assessment of future commodity prices based on long term supply and demand forecasts for electricity and natural gas  operational performance of the underlying assets  legal and regulatory factors affecting our industry  long term interest rates and our current credit profile and cost of capital 
as a result of applying the complex guidance outlined in fin r  we may be required to consolidate assets we do not legally own and liabilities that we are not legally obligated to satisfy 
also  future changes in a vie s legal or capital structure may cause us to reassess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary and may result in our consolidation or deconsolidation of that entity 
significant judgment was required in making our assessment of whether or not a vie was a special purpose entity spe for purposes of applying fin r as of october  entities that meet the definition of a business outlined in fin r and that satisfy other formation and involvement criteria are not subject to the fin r consolidation guidelines 
the definitional characteristics of a business include having inputs such as long lived assets  the ability to obtain access to necessary materials and employees  processes such as strategic management  operational process and resource management  and the ability to obtain access to the customers that purchase the outputs of the entity 
since the current accounting literature does not provide a definition of an spe  our assessment was primarily based on the degree to which a vie aligned with the definition of a business 
based on this assessment  we determined that three vies  calpine capital trusts i  ii and iii  were spes and subject to fin r as of october  consequently as discussed in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we deconsolidated these entities 
initial adoption of new accounting standards in sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure prior to we accounted for qualified stock compensation under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  we were required to recognize stock compensation as expense only to the extent that there is a difference in value between the market price of the stock being offered to employees and the price those employees must pay to acquire the stock 
the expense measurement methodology provided by apb is commonly referred to as the intrinsic value based method 
to date  our stock compensation program has been based primarily on stock options whose exercise prices are equal to the market price of calpine stock on the date of the stock option grant  consequently  under apb we had historically incurred minimal stock compensation expense 
on january   we prospectively adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for companies that voluntarily change their accounting for stock based compensation from the less preferred intrinsic value based method to the more preferred fair value based method 
prior to its amendment  sfas no 
required that companies enacting a voluntary change in accounting principle from the intrinsic value methodology provided by apb could only do so on a prospective basis  no adoption or transition provisions were established to allow for a restatement of prior period financial statements 
sfas no 
provides two additional transition options to report the change in accounting principle the modified prospective method and the retroactive restatement method 
additionally  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we elected to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
on a prospective 
table of contents basis  consequently  we are required to provide a pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share as if sfas no 
accounting had been applied to all prior periods presented within our financial statements 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of a stock option or its equivalent is estimated on the date of grant by using an option pricing model  such as the black scholes model or a binomial model 
the option pricing model selected should take into account  as of the stock option s grant date  the exercise price and expected life of the stock option  the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility  expected dividends on the stock  and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the stock option 
the fair value calculated by this model is then recognized as compensation expense over the period in which the related employee services are rendered 
unless specifically defined within the provisions of the stock option granted  the service period is presumed to begin on the grant date and end when the stock option is fully vested 
depending on the vesting structure of the stock option and other variables that are built into the option pricing model  the fair value of the stock option is recognized over the service period using either a straight line method the single option approach or a more conservative  accelerated method the multiple option approach 
for consistency  we have chosen the multiple option approach  which we have used historically for pro forma disclosure purposes 
the multiple option approach views one four year option grant as four separate sub grants  each representing of the total number of stock options granted 
the first sub grant vests over one year  the second sub grant vests over two years  the third sub grant vests over three years  and the fourth sub grant vests over four years 
under this scenario  over of the total fair value of the stock option grant is recognized during the first year of the vesting period  and nearly of the total fair value of the stock option grant is recognized by the end of the second year of the vesting period 
by contrast  if we were to apply the single option approach  only and of the total fair value of the stock option grant would be recognized as compensation expense by the end of the first and second years of the vesting period  respectively 
we have selected the black scholes model  primarily because it is the most commonly recognized options pricing model among us based corporations 
nonetheless  we believe this model tends to overstate the true fair value of our employee stock options in that our options cannot be freely traded  have vesting requirements  and are subject to blackout periods during which  even if vested  they cannot be traded 
we will monitor valuation trends and techniques as more companies adopt sfas no 
and as additional guidance is provided by fasb and review our choices as appropriate in the future 
the key assumption in our black scholes model is the expected life of the stock option  because it is this figure that drives our expected volatility calculation  as well as our risk free interest rate 
the expected life of the option relies on two factors the option s vesting period and the expected term that an employee holds the option once it has vested 
there is no single method described by sfas no 
for predicting future events such as how long an employee holds on to an option or what the expected volatility of a company s stock price will be  the facts and circumstances are unique to different companies and depend on factors such as historical employee stock option exercise patterns  significant changes in the market place that could create a material impact on a company s stock price in the future  and changes in a company s stock based compensation structure 
we base our expected option terms on historical employee exercise patterns 
we have segregated our employees into four different categories based on the fact that different groups of employees within our company have exhibited different stock exercise patterns in the past  usually based on employee rank and income levels 
therefore  we have concluded that we will perform separate black scholes calculations for four employee groups executive officers  senior vice presidents  vice presidents  and all other employees 
we compute our expected stock price volatility based on our stock s historical movements 
for each employee group  we measure the volatility of our stock over a period that equals the expected term of the option 
in the case of our executive officers  this means we measure our stock price volatility dating back to our public inception in  because these employees are expected to hold their options for over years after the options have fully vested 
in the case of other employees  volatility is only measured dating back years 
in the short run  this causes other employees to generate a higher volatility figure than the other company employee groups because our stock price has fluctuated significantly in the past four years 
as of december   the volatility for our employee groups ranged from

accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
applies to fiscal years beginning after june  and amends sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
this standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal use of the assets and requires that a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized when incurred  recorded at fair value and classified as a liability in the balance sheet 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity will capitalize the cost and increase the carrying value of the related long lived asset 
asset retirement obligations represent future liabilities  and  as a result  accretion expense will be accrued on this liability until the obligation is satisfied 
at the same time  the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
at the settlement date  the entity will settle the obligation for its recorded amount or recognize a gain or loss upon settlement 
we adopted the new rules on asset retirement obligations on january  as required by the new rules  we recorded liabilities equal to the present value of expected future asset retirement obligations at january  we identified obligations related to operating gas fired power plants  geothermal power plants and oil and gas properties 
the liabilities are partially offset by increases in net assets recorded as if the provisions of sfas no 
had been in effect at the date the obligation was incurred  which for power plants is generally the start of construction and typically building up during construction until commercial operations for the facility is achieved 
for oil and gas properties the date the obligation is incurred is generally the start of drilling of a well or the start of construction of a facility and typically building up until completion of drilling of a well or completion of construction of a facility 
fin guarantors accounting and disclosure for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others in november fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees 
fin also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  it must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee  including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements for fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december   and have been incorporated into our december   disclosures of guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements

c is effective as of the first day of the fiscal quarter beginning after july   ie october   for us with early application permitted 
in conjunction with initially applying the implementation guidance  dig issue no 
c requires the recognition of a special transition adjustment for certain contracts containing a price adjustment feature based on a broad market index for which the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception had been previously elected 
in those circumstances  the derivative contract should be recognized at fair value as of the date of the initial application with a corresponding adjustment of net income as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
it should then be applied prospectively for all existing contracts as of the effective date and for all future transactions 
two of our power sales contracts  which meet the definition of a derivative and for which we previously elected the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception  use a cpi or similar index to escalate the operations and maintenance o m charges 
adoption of dig issue no 
c required us to recognize a special transition accounting adjustment for the estimated future economic benefits of these contracts 
we based the transition adjustment on the nature and extent of the key price adjustment features in the contracts and estimated future market conditions on the date of adoption  such as the forward price of power and natural gas and the expected rate of inflation 
we will realize the actual future economic benefits of these contracts over the remaining lives of these contracts which extend through and as actual power deliveries occur  although dig issue no

impact of recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fasb in recent years has issued numerous new accounting standards that have already taken effect or will soon impact us 
in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements we invite your attention to a discussion of several new standards  emerging issues and interpretations under the section entitled new accounting pronouncements 

table of contents below is a detailed discussion of how we apply sfas no 
since this accounting standard has a profound impact on how we account for our energy contracts and transactions 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
we currently hold six classes of derivative instruments that are impacted by the new pronouncement foreign currency swaps  interest rate swaps  forward interest rate agreements  commodity financial instruments  commodity contracts  and physical options 
consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 we evaluate all of our contracts to determine whether or not they qualify as derivatives under the accounting pronouncement 
for a given contract  there are typically three steps we use to determine its proper accounting treatment 
first  based on the terms and conditions of the contract  as well as the applicable guidelines established by sfas no 
 we identify the contract as being either a derivative or non derivative contract 
second  if the contract is not a derivative  we further identify its specific classification eg whether or not it qualifies as a lease and apply the appropriate non derivative accounting treatment 
alternatively  if the contract does qualify as a derivative under the guidance of sfas no 
 we evaluate whether or not it qualifies for the normal purchases and sales exception as described below 
if the contract qualifies for the exception  we apply the traditional accrual accounting treatment 
finally  if the contract qualifies as a derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception  we apply the accounting treatment required by sfas no 
 which is outlined below in further detail 
the diagram below illustrates the process we use for the purposes of identifying the classification and subsequent accounting treatment of our contracts classification flow chart 
table of contents as an independent power producer primarily focused on generation of electricity using gas fired turbines  our natural physical commodity position is short fuel ie  natural gas consumer and long power capacity ie  electricity seller 
additionally  we also have a natural long crude position due to our petroleum reserves 
to manage forward exposure to price fluctuation  we execute commodity derivative contracts as defined by sfas no 
as we apply sfas no 
 derivatives can receive one of four treatments depending on associated circumstances exemption from sfas no 
accounting treatment if these contracts qualify as normal purchases and sales contracts  fair value hedges  cash flow hedges  or undesignated derivatives 
normal purchases and sales normal purchases and sales  as defined by paragraph b 
of sfas no 
and amended by sfas no 
 are exempt from sfas no 
accounting treatment 
as a result  these contracts are not required to be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values and any fluctuations in these values are not required to be reported within earnings 
probability of physical delivery from our generation plants  in the case of electricity sales  and to our generation plants  in the case of natural gas contracts  is required over the life of the contract within reasonable tolerances 
on june   fasb cleared sfas no 
implementation issue no 
c dealing with a proposed electric industry normal purchases and sales exception for capacity sales transactions the eligibility of option contracts in electricity for the normal purchases and normal sales exception 
on december   fasb revised the criteria for qualifying for the normal exception 
as a result of issue no 
c  as revised  certain power purchase and or sale agreements that are structured as capacity sales contracts are now eligible to qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception 
because we are long power capacity  we often enter into capacity sales contracts as a means to recover the costs incurred from maintaining and operating our power plants as well as the costs directly associated with the generation and sale of electricity to our customers 
under issue no 
c  a capacity sales contract qualifies for the normal purchases and sales exception subject to certain conditions 
a majority of our capacity sales contracts qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception 
cash flow hedges and fair value hedges within the energy industry  cash flow and fair value hedge transactions typically use the same types of standard transactions ie  offered for purchase sale in over the counter markets or commodity exchanges 
fair value hedges as further defined in sfas no 
 fair value hedge transactions hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of either all or a specific portion of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment 
the accounting treatment for fair value hedges requires reporting both the changes in fair values of a hedged item the underlying risk and the hedging instrument the derivative designated to offset the underlying risk on both the balance sheet and the income statement 
on that basis  when a firm commitment is associated with a hedge instrument that attains effectiveness under the effectiveness criteria outlined in sfas no 
 there is no net earnings impact because the earnings caused by the changes in fair value of the hedged item will move in an equal  but opposite  amount as the earnings caused by the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument 
in other words  the earnings volatility caused by the underlying risk factor will be neutralized because of the hedge 
for example  if we want to manage the price risk ie the risk that market electric rates will rise  making a fixed price contract less valuable associated with all or a portion of a fixed price power sale that has been identified as a normal transaction as described above  we might create a fair value hedge by purchasing fixed price power 
from that date and time forward until delivery  the change in fair value of the hedged item and hedge instrument will be reported in earnings with asset liability offsets on the balance sheet 
if there is effectiveness  there is no net earnings impact 
if there is less than effectiveness  the fair value change of the hedged item the underlying risk and the hedging instrument the derivative will likely be different and the ineffectiveness will result in a net earnings impact 

table of contents cash flow hedges as further defined in sfas no 
 cash flow hedge transactions hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows ie  in our case  the price variability of forecasted purchases of gas and sales of power  as well as interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposure 
in the case of cash flow hedges  the hedged item the underlying risk is generally unrecognized ie  not recorded on the balance sheet prior to delivery  and any changes in this fair value  therefore  will not be recorded within earnings 
conceptually  if a cash flow hedge is effective  this means that a variable  such as movement in power prices  has been effectively fixed  so that any fluctuations will have no net result on either cash flows or earnings 
therefore  if the changes in fair value of the hedged item are not recorded in earnings  then the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument the derivative must also be excluded from the income statement  or else a one sided net impact on earnings will be reported  despite the fact that the establishment of the effective hedge results in no net economic impact 
to prevent such a scenario from occurring  sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge be recorded as an asset or liability on the balance sheet  but with the offset reported as part of other comprehensive income oci  to the extent that the hedge is effective 
similar to fair value hedges  any ineffectiveness portion will be reflected in earnings 
the diagram below illustrates the process used to account for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges cash flow hedges flow chart certain contracts could either qualify for exemption from sfas no 
accounting as normal purchases or sales or be designated as effective hedges 
our marketing and sales and fuels groups generally transact with load serving entities and other end users of electricity and with fuel suppliers  respectively  in physical contracts where delivery is expected 
these transactions are structured as normal purchases and sales  when possible  and if the normal exception is not allowed  we seek to structure the transactions as cash flow hedges 
conversely  our ces risk management desks generally transact in over the counter or exchange traded contracts  in hedging transactions 
these transactions are designated as hedges when possible  notwithstanding the fact that some might qualify as normal purchases or sales 

table of contents undesignated derivatives the fair values and changes in fair values of undesignated derivatives are recorded in earnings  with the corresponding offsets recorded as derivative assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
we have the following types of undesignated transactions transactions are executed at a location where we do not have an associated natural long generation capacity or short fuel consumption requirements position of sufficient quantity for the entire term of the transaction eg  power sales where we do not own generating assets or intend to acquire transmission rights for delivery from other assets for any portion of the contract term  and transactions executed with the intent to profit from short term price movements  and discontinuance de designation of hedge treatment prospectively consistent with paragraphs and of sfas no 
in circumstances where we believe the hedge relationship is no longer necessary  we will remove the hedge designation and close out the hedge positions by entering into an equal and offsetting derivative position 
prospectively  the two derivative positions should generally have no net earnings impact because the changes in their fair values are offsetting 
accumulated other comprehensive income accumulated other comprehensive income aoci includes the following components i unrealized pre tax gains losses  net of reclassification to earnings adjustments  from effective cash flow hedges as designated pursuant to sfas no 
 see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  ii unrealized pre tax gains losses that result from the translation of foreign subsidiaries balance sheets from the foreign functional currency to our consolidated reporting currency us  iii other comprehensive income from equity method investees  and iv the taxes associated with the unrealized gains losses from items i and iii
