overview we are a leading manufacturer of circulatory support products for use by patients with congestive heart failure  or chf 
according to the american heart association  million patients in the united states suffer from chf and an additional  patients are diagnosed with this disease annually 
we were the first company to receive approval from the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to commercially market a ventricular assist device  or vad  to treat patients with late stage heart failure  which comprises approximately to of the chf patient population 
our vads are used primarily by these chf patients to perform some or all of the pumping function of the heart and we currently offer the widest range of products to serve this market 
we believe that our long standing reputation for quality and innovation and our excellent relationships with leading cardiovascular surgeons worldwide position us to capture growth opportunities in the expanding congestive heart failure market 
through our itc subsidiary  we design  develop  manufacture and market point of care diagnostic test systems that provide fast  accurate blood test results to improve patient management  reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 
our business model the two product lines that represent the majority of our revenues are ventricular assist devices vad and point of care diagnostic test systems and services 
historical revenue mix has been as follows vad pumps including associated products and services point of care diagnostic test systems grafts other net revenues ventricular assist devices the vad is a mechanical device to assist a failing heart pump blood  both as a temporary measure until an failing heart recovers or is replaced in a heart transplant bridge to transplants btt  and as a permanent implant to supplement the efforts of the heart to pump blood destination therapy dt 
we derive our vad revenue from two different vad products as follows the heartmate vad was acquired in our merger with thermo cardio systems division of thermo electron 
this vad is made of titanium  contains an electrically powered pump  provides a safe interface with blood through a sintering process applied to the titanium  and has an average selling price that is typically approximately  per unit 
the heartmate vad is only approved to assist the left ventricle  and is implanted inside the body cavity 
it is currently approved for use in btt and dt 
the thoratec vad is made of polymers  is powered pneumatically  provides a safe interface with blood through our proprietary thoralon coating  and has an average selling price that is approximately  the thoratec vad is approved to assist the left and the right ventricle  and is worn outside the body cavity 
it is currently approved for use in btt 

table of contents vad revenue historically has been split approximately equally between the heartmate and the thoratec vad  while unit sales volume has historically been weighted around in favor of the thoratec vad 
as dt becomes a more significant element of our business  we expect unit shipments and revenue for the heartmate vad to grow to exceed that of the thoratec vad 
the market  competition and barriers to entry we estimate we have in excess of of the vad market domestically and more than internationally 
domestic revenue growth will come from expanding the market through new indications for our current products  in particular the recent approval of destination therapy  and from the development and approval of new  generally smaller and longer lasting products  that can be used in a broader range of patients 
internationally we expect growth to come by taking market share from our competitors and from expanding the market 
we believe that potential competitors are at least years away from completion of dt clinical trials required before those products will become commercially available and compete with our products in the united states 
in addition  unless our competitor s products result in significantly better outcomes than our products  we believe that absent any compelling reasons  cardiac centers will not generally change suppliers 
the use of our vads for destination therapy in patients who are not candidates for heart transplantation was approved by the fda in  and was approved for reimbursement by cms in late we estimate that there are approximately  people who could be candidates for destination therapy  of which we believe between  and  are treatable using current technologies 
our future revenue growth is dependent on the successful adoption and sale of our products for destination therapy 
point of care diagnostic test systems business through our itc subsidiary  we design  develop  manufacture and market point of care diagnostic test systems that provide fast  accurate blood test results  to monitor a patient s coagulation while they are being administered anticoagulants  and to monitor a patient s blood gas electrolyte and chemistry status 
these products are sold into hospitals  physician s offices  long term care facilities  clinics  visiting nurse associations  and home healthcare companies 
the market  competition and barriers to entry large medical device companies dominate these markets and we estimate our products hold anywhere from to market share 
growth in this market will come from taking market share away from other companies  and from testing being shifted from the central laboratory to the point of care 
however  this market segment is very competitive  and includes the following potential drivers new drug therapies under development may not require the intense monitoring of a patient s coagulation that the current anti coagulation drug of choice heparin requires 
new competitors that might enter the market with broader test menus 
to address this risk  in late we acquired the irma immediate response mobile analysis product line of blood gas electrolyte and chemistry tests  which has significantly increased our test menu offering  and also offers us the opportunity to develop the next generation system that combines blood gas and electrolyte testing in one machine 
overall  we are planning for sales of our point of care diagnostic test systems to grow at an annual growth rate of up to for the next several years 
this growth assumes increased patient testing  better patient outcomes  and increased decentralization of testing from central laboratories to point of care 
we expect our international sales to increase from currently to approximately of itc s total sales by mergers on september   we completed an asset purchase of the immediate response mobile analysis  or irma  point of care blood analysis system product line from diametrics medical  inc diametrics 
we paid approximately million in cash and assumed trade payables 
the purchase price was allocated based on the fair value of assets acquired as determined by an independent valuation firm as follows in thousands 
table of contents life working capital property  plant and equipment  years core technology years existing developed technology  years patents years other intangibles years in process research and development expensed in acquisition costs consideration paid there was no goodwill recorded with the transaction 
as a result of the acquisition   relating to in process research and development was expensed in the fourth quarter of the merger of thoratec with tca was completed on february  we issued new shares of our common stock to the shareholders of tca in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of tca at an exchange ratio of shares of thoratec stock for each share of tca stock 
the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition because former shareholders of tca owned a majority of our outstanding stock subsequent to the merger 
for accounting purposes  tca is deemed to have acquired thoratec 
our consolidated financial information presented herein includes the financial results of tca for the full fiscal year and thoratec s financial results for the post merger period from february  through december  restructuring plan in june  we initiated a restructuring plan to consolidate all of our vad manufacturing operations to our facilities in pleasanton  california 
through april  the completion date of the restructuring plan  we have recorded a total of million of restructuring charges 
these charges represent estimated employee severance costs and stock option acceleration charges

table of contents fiscal years and sales product sales in were million compared to million in the primary components of the million increase in revenues were as follows higher vad sales 
the majority of this increase came from higher sales of the heartmate vad million higher graft sales million higher revenue from sales of ancillary products million higher revenue from sales of point of care diagnostic test systems at our itc subsidiary million revenue from irma product line acquired by itc in the fourth quarter of million we are currently planning revenue in the range of million 
this is highly dependent upon the success of our destination therapy activities in generating significant revenues 
we anticipate the majority of these revenues in the second half of gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from in to in due to the following drivers higher vad average selling prices resulted in a increase in margin 
this is driven largely by sales in of our heartmate vad representing a higher percentage of our revenue when compared to the lower priced thoratec vad 
the heartmate vad typically sells at an asp of between  and  while the thoratec vad typically sells at an asp between  and  lower margins on itc product lines resulted in a decline in the company s overall margins 
this includes the impact of the irma product line we acquired in the fourth quarter of which currently operates with margins in the range  compared to the margins on other products sold by our itc division which typically sell at margins in the range  and the impact of higher scrap  higher freight  and lower asp s in our incision product line 
as we recognize higher revenues for our current destination therapy initiatives  we anticipate that margins will trend upwards into the mid range as the higher margin vad products represent a larger portion of our overall revenues 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in underlying the million increase in spending were the following drivers increased headcount from at the end of to at the end of to at the end of  together with annual salary increases aggregating effective january higher spending on medicare reimbursement activities and market research and related activities  primarily associated with destination therapy  and costs associated with the irma product line acquired in q  higher insurance premiums higher facilities costs related to higher headcount 
these higher costs were offset by lower legal costs associated with filing an s in that did not recur in  and lower meeting expense related to a customer event in that did not recur in we anticipate that selling  general and administrative costs will generally increase each year as our business grows  with some quarterly and annual spending around events such as product introductions  and with spending as a percentage of revenue trending downward as revenues from current products increase  in particular as we realize revenue associated with destination therapy 
research and development research and development expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in research and development costs are largely project driven  and the level of spending depends on the level of 
table of contents project activity planned and subsequently approved and conducted 
projects typically include efforts to develop new products such as the heartmate ii and heartmate iii  efforts to improve the operation and performance of current products such as efforts to improve the life of various components of the heartmate and the thoratec vad products 
research and development costs also include regulatory and clinical costs associated with our compliance with fda regulations 
we anticipate that research and development costs will generally increase modestly each year as our business grows  with some quarterly and annual spikes in spending around events such as product introductions and regulatory approvals  and with spending as a percentage of revenue trending downward as revenues from current products increase  in particular as we realize revenue associated with destination therapy 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million compared to million in we anticipate that amortization of intangible assets in will total approximately million 
amortization of goodwill beginning in  we have stopped amortizing goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
impairment of intangible asset subsequent to year end  the company completed its assessment of the final results from its feasibility clinical trial for the aria cabg graft  which was ongoing through fiscal based on the clinical trial results  the company determined that it will not devote additional resources to the development of the aria graft 
upon the decision to discontinue product development  the company recorded an impairment charge of million as of january  to write off purchased intangible assets related to the aria graft  which were recorded as a result of the merger 
in process research and development costs in process research and development expense in was million related to our acquisition of the irma product line 
legal settlement  merger  restructuring and other costs legal settlement  merger  restructuring and other charges in were million compared to million in the expense is primarily comprised of million to settle a patent infringement claim filed against us by bodycote materials testing canada  inc and david c 
macgregor  m 
d related to materials used in the company s heartmate lvas 
interest and other income net interest and other income net in was million compared to million in this increase was primarily due to million less interest paid due to the redemption of our debentures in march  offset partially by the impact of lower interest rates on invested cash in  which resulted in a decrease in interest income of million from million in to million in  and the impact of our foreign exchange hedging program commenced in income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to an effective tax rate of in this reduction reflects the relatively larger impact of various tax incentives  nondeductible expenses and tax credits in when net income subject to tax was less than million 
based on a pre tax loss in of million  the impact of these tax differences is proportionately lower 
fiscal years and product sales product sales in were million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in vad product sales of million resulting from higher unit sales and average selling prices  an increase in vascular graft product sales of million due to higher unit sales  and an increase in itc sales of million 

table of contents product sales in included thoratec sales for the post merger period from february  through december  whereas product sales in included thoratec sales for the full months of the increase in itc sales million was primarily due to increases in sales of our blood coagulation testing products of million 
gross profit gross profit in was million  representing approximately of product sales  compared to million  representing approximately of product sales in this increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher average selling prices for our vad products and lower manufacturing and product service costs as a percentage of sales in compared to selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in while selling  general and administrative expenses were consistent as a percentage of product sales from period to period  they increased as a result of promotional activities  new product introductions and costs to expand markets for our blood coagulation testing equipment and vads as well as higher insurance costs  costs associated with computer systems installed in and business development activities 
research and development research and development expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in this increase resulted from an increase in spending for certain vad product development programs partially offset by lower spending related to the rematch trials 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million compared to million in as of january   intangible assets of million have been recorded as a result of our merger and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of eight to twenty years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 at the beginning of we reclassified our purchased intangible asset related to acquired workforce in the net amount of million to goodwill and ceased amortization of that asset 
the increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets from is due to the inclusion of a full year of amortization in compared to only ten months of amortization in amortization of goodwill amortization of goodwill in was million 
beginning in  we have stopped amortizing goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
in process research and development costs in process research and development  or ipr d  expense in was million and represents the one time write off of nonrecurring charges associated with our merger in february for projects that had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and for which successful development was uncertain 
one of the projects was completed in there have been no significant developments subsequent to the merger related to the current status of any of the remaining ipr d projects that would result in material changes to the assumptions or resulting valuation performed at the time of the merger 
development of ipr d projects continues and while the timing of completion of these projects may vary due to the highly regulated and technical nature of our products  current estimates remain materially consistent with our initial estimates 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete the development of these products on a timely basis 
failure to complete these projects could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents legal settlement  merger  restructuring and other costs legal settlement  merger  restructuring and other charges in were million compared to million in the amount included costs consisting mainly of executive waiver agreement costs of million  restructuring costs of million representing estimated severance costs related to the consolidation of our vad manufacturing operations  and other costs of million related to the termination of a european distribution agreement 
the amount included employee severance of million  executive waiver agreement costs of million  consulting  accounting and legal expenses of million  restructuring costs of million  representing estimated severance costs related to the consolidation of our vad manufacturing operations  and costs of million related to the events of september  interest and other income net interest and other income net in was million compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in interest income caused by both lower cash balances and a reduction in interest rates during the decrease in interest income was partially offset by a reduction of interest expense due to the redemption of our subordinated convertible debentures in the first quarter of and an increase in other income primarily related to foreign currency translation gains 
income taxes our effective tax provision rate was in compared to an effective tax benefit rate of in for  the effective tax provision rate exceeded the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
our effective tax benefit rate for differed from the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the impact on the reported net loss of nondeductible expenses related to our merger with tca  including the write off of ipr d costs  the amortization of goodwill and other nondeductible merger transaction costs 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of  we had working capital of million compared with million at the end of cash and cash equivalents at the end of were million compared to million at the end of  an increase of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million in in addition we had cash flows from financing activities of million in from the sale of stock  through the exercising of stock options and stock issued under the newly implemented employee stock purchase plan 
this total of million of cash inflows was offset by million net purchases of available for sale investments  million paid to acquire property  plant and equipment which primarily consisted of million of equipment additions and million of leasehold improvements  and million used in the acquisition of the irma product line 
in february  we announced a stock repurchase program under which up to million of our common stock could be acquired in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases were based on several conditions  including the price of our stock  general market conditions and other factors 
we believe that cash and investments on hand and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements for the foreseeable future  and our stock repurchase program 
the impact of inflation on our financial position and the results of operations was not significant during any of the years presented 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
merger accounting 
table of contents on september   we completed an asset purchase of the immediate response mobile analysis  or irma  point of care blood analysis system product line from diametrics medical  inc diametrics 
we paid million in cash and assumed trade payables 
the purchase price was allocated based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as determined by an independent valuation firm 
as a result of the acquisition   relating to in process research and development was expensed in the fourth quarter of on february   thoratec completed its merger with tca 
pursuant to the merger agreement between thoratec and tca  thoratec issued new shares of its common stock to the shareholders of tca in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of tca 
the merger was treated as a reverse acquisition because the shareholders of tca owned the majority of thoratec common stock after the merger 
tca was considered the acquiror for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
due to the reverse acquisition  thoratec s assets and liabilities were recorded based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the purchase price is also allocated to intangible assets  including goodwill 
approximately million of the total purchase price of million was allocated to goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
the amounts allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets will affect the amount of amortization expense we recognize in future periods and could result in a possible impairment expense if at some future date such assets were determined to be impaired 
as a result of the merger  million relating to ipr d was expensed in the first quarter of the write off of ipr d was related to projects that were in development  had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and for which successful development was uncertain 
there have been no significant developments subsequent to the merger related to the current status of any of the ipr d projects that would result in material changes to the assumptions or resulting valuation performed at the time of the merger 
development of ipr d projects continues and while the timing of completion of these projects may vary due to the highly regulated and technical nature of the company s products  current estimates remain materially consistent with the company s initial estimates 
evaluation of goodwill and purchased intangibles for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which we adopted as of the beginning of fiscal year  we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used including intangible assets  when events or circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
as of the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and ceased the amortization of purchased goodwill 
in addition  we reevaluated the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets and determined that the remaining useful lives were appropriate 
each year we complete an impairment test of goodwill as required by sfas no 
upon completion of our impairment tests as of the end of fiscal  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales to distributors are recorded when title transfers upon shipment 
one distributor has certain limited product return rights 
a limited number of other distributors have certain rights of return upon termination of their distribution agreement 
a reserve for sales returns is recorded for these customers applying reasonable estimates of product returns based upon significant historical experience in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
no other direct sales customers or distributors have return rights or price protection 
sales of certain cardiovascular segment products to first time customers are recognized when it has been determined that the customer has the ability to use such products 
these sales frequently include the sale of products and training services under multiple element arrangements 
for most customers  training is not essential to the functionality of the products as the customers already possess sufficient expertise and experience to use the products 
in these situations  training is provided as a best practice to optimize the use 
table of contents and success of the products 
the amount of revenues under these arrangements allocated to training is based upon fair market value of the training  performed principally by third party providers 
the amount of revenues allocated to the cardiovascular segment products is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered training element based on the fair market value  with the remainder being allocated to the cardiovascular segment products 
the amount of revenues allocated to training is recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized when the training is completed 
as of the end of  million of products have been delivered and recorded as product sales for customers that were determined to be able to use those products  but for which training had not yet been completed 
the amount of revenue deferred related to this training not yet completed was  at the end of   at the end of and  at the end of we also rent certain medical devices to customers on a month to month or as used basis

the majority of our products are covered by a one year limited manufacturer s warranty from the date of installation 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when related sales are recognized and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the change in accrued warranty expense in and is summarized in the following table in thousands balance charges to balance beginning costs and warranty end of year expenses expenditures of year year ended year ended year ended reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments owed to us for product sales 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required

all investments mature within two years or less from the date of purchase 
the holdings of any one issuer  except government agencies  do not exceed of the portfolio 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the market value of these investments may fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase by from the levels at january   absent other factors  we estimate the fair market value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount

table of contents foreign currency rate fluctuations we conduct business in foreign countries 
our international operations consist primarily of sales and service personnel for our ventricular assist products  who report into our us sales and marketing group and are internally reported as part of that group 
all assets and liabilities of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars at the period end exchange rates  and the resulting translation adjustments are included in comprehensive income 
the period end translation of our non functional currency assets and liabilities primarily assets and liabilities on our uk subsidiary consolidated balance sheet that are not denominated in uk pounds at the period end exchange rates result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses  which are included in interest and other income net 
commencing in september of  the company began using forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of these non functional currency assets and liabilities 
changes in the fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts are included in interest and other income net  and typically offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses described above 
these derivatives are not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges under sfas no
