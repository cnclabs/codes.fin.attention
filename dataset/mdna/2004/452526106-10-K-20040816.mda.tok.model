 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  for agreements entered into beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year the company s medical instrument sales contracts involve multiple deliverables  including the sale or rental of an instrument including training and installation  the subsequent servicing of the instrument during the first year  and reagent products provided to the customer during the validation period 
the portion of the instrument sales price applicable to the instrument itself including training and installation  which is determined based on fair value  is recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations relating to training and or installation based on the terms of the related agreement 
the portion of the sales price applicable to reagent products provided to the customer during the validation period  based on fair value  are recognized when the instrument itself is recognized as generally such recognition occurs when the validation period is completed

if the financial condition of any of immucor s customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of first in  first out cost or market 
cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company uses a standard cost system as a tool to monitor production efficiency 
the standard cost system applies estimated labor and manufacturing overhead factors to inventory based on budgeted production and efficiency levels  staffing levels and costs of operation  based on the experience and judgment of management 
actual costs and production levels may vary from the standard established and are charged to the consolidated statement of operations as a component of cost of sales 
since us generally accepted accounting principles require that the standard cost approximate actual cost  periodic adjustments are necessary 
the provision for obsolete inventory is reviewed on a quarterly basis 
all finished good reagent products with less than six months dating are written down to zero 
any raw  intermediate  or finished product that has been quarantined because it has failed quality control  needs to be reworked  or is past its expiration date is written down to zero 
should the product be successfully reworked and pass final quality control checks  it is then valued at its standard cost 
obsolete and quarantined inventory is physically segregated from useable and saleable inventory and destroyed according to regulatory and fiscal guidelines

overview for fiscal  the company s strategy is focused primarily on improving gross margin and on developing its third generation automated assay instrument 
while the company s net sales for the year ended may  increased to million from million for the year ended may   gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended may  from for the year ended may  as discussed below under results of operations  the deterioration in gross margin was due to several factors  including o increased production  quality and regulatory costs  o increased reagent sales to european distributors at relatively lower margins than direct sales to end users  o increased instrument service burden  and o costs incurred to consolidate red cell manufacturing facilities 
while the company plans to continue european sales through distributors  as the company believes that utilizing distributors established in key european markets is far more advantageous to the company than developing its own sales and distribution network in these markets  it has implemented steps to stabilize and improve gross margin  including o the elimination of a number of redundant products currently manufactured at the company s three manufacturing facilities  partially completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing through the first quarter of fiscal  o the consolidation of the company s red cell product manufacturing  previously produced at both the norcross and houston facilities  to the company s norcross facility  completed at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  o obtaining fda clearance of the galileo tm for marketing in the united states  and o the development of a third generation automated assay instrument from which the company expects to produce higher margins and lower service costs when it is introduced currently projected for fiscal year 
on april   the company obtained fda clearance to market its high volume galileo instrument in the us  designed for the large sized hospital market 
the instrument revenue and the related reagent revenue stream are expected to improve gross margins  because the instrument requires proprietary reagents developed for automated technology  thus commanding a premium price over traditional products 
as of july   the company has placed galileo instruments with international customers since introducing the galileo to the european market during the first quarter of the company recently announced it is developing a third generation instrument  currently referred to as the g and planned for release in the g is targeted at the small to medium sized hospital market  the largest segment of the company s customers  which number approximately  worldwide  to which the company s abs instrument is currently marketed 
the g is expected to be significantly smaller and faster than the abs  but have substantially all of the features of the company s larger galileo product  apart from lower throughput 
the g s smaller size is designed to allow depot service where a customer delivers an instrument to a company depot for servicing and receives a loaner instrument to use until servicing is complete 
the company expects this depot method to be more cost effective than sending repair personnel to the customer s site  and accordingly expects instrument service costs will eventually decline as the g replaces the abs liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million  million  and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively
