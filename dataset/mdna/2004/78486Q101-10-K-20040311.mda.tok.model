item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk factors that may affect future results 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in item of this report 
certain reclassifications have been made to our prior years results to conform to presentations 
such reclassifications had no effect on our results of operations or stockholders equity 
overview of company operations for over years  we have been dedicated to helping entrepreneurs succeed  specifically focusing on industries where we have deep knowledge and relationships 
our focus remains on the technology  life science  private equity  and premium wine niches 
in  we continued to diversify our services to support our clients throughout their life cycles  regardless of their age or size 
we offer a range of financial services that generate three distinct sources of income 
in part  our income is generated from interest rate differentials 
the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rates received on interest earning assets  such as loans extended to clients and securities held in our investment portfolio  accounts for the major portion of our earnings 
our deposits are largely obtained from clients within our technology  life science  and premium winery industry sectors  and  to a lesser extent  from individuals served by our private banking division 
we do not obtain deposits from conventional retail sources and have no brokered deposits 
as part of negotiated credit facilities  we frequently obtain rights to acquire stock in the form of warrants in certain client companies 
fee based services also generate income for the company 
we market our full range of financial services to clients and private equity firms including venture capitalists 
in addition to our commercial and personal banking services  we offer fee based merger and acquisition services  private placements  and investment and advisory services 
our ability to integrate and cross sell our diverse financial services to our clients is a strength of our business model 
in addition  we seek to obtain equity returns through investments in direct private equity and venture capital fund investments 
we also manage two limited partnerships a venture capital fund and a fund that invests in venture capital funds 
critical accounting policies the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to the marketable and non marketable equity securities  allowance for loan losses  and goodwill 
management bases its estimates on historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the accounting policies discussed below are the most critical to our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgments 
each estimate is discussed below 
the financial impact of each estimate  to the extent significant to financial results  is discussed in the applicable sections of the management s discussion and analysis 
executive management discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with our audit committee on january  marketable equity securities our investments in marketable equity securities include unexercised warrants for shares of publicly traded companies 
investments in shares of publicly traded companies 
equity securities in our warrant  direct equity  and venture capital fund portfolios generally become marketable when a portfolio company completes an initial public offering on a publicly reported market  or is acquired by a publicly traded company 
marketable equity securities related to taurus growth partners  lp and libra partners  lp for information on these entities  see item business business combinations 
unrealized gains or losses on warrant and equity investment securities are recorded upon the establishment of a readily determinable fair value of the underlying security  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity instruments 
unrealized gains or losses after applicable taxes  on available for sale marketable equity securities that result from initial public offerings are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
we are often contractually restricted from selling equity securities  for a certain period of time  subsequent to the portfolio company s initial public offering 
gains or losses on these marketable equity instruments are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in the period the underlying securities are sold to a third party 
gains or losses on marketable warrant and equity investment securities that result from a portfolio company being acquired by a publicly traded company are marked to market when the acquisition occurs 
the resulting gains or losses are recognized into income on that date  in accordance with emerging issues task force  issue no 
 nonmonetary exchange of cost method investments 
further fluctuations in the market value of these marketable equity instruments  prior to eventual sale  are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
upon the sale of these equity securities to a third party  gains and losses  which are measured from the acquisition price  are recognized in our consolidated statements of income 
if we possess a warrant that can be settled with a net cash payment to us  the warrant meets the definition of a derivative instrument 
changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are recognized as securities gains or losses in our consolidated statements of income 
notwithstanding the foregoing  a decline in the fair value of any of these securities that is considered other than temporary is recorded in our consolidated statements of income in the period the impairment occurs 
the cost basis of the underlying security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis 
we consider our marketable equity securities accounting policies to be critical  as the timing and amount of income  if any  from these instruments typically depend upon factors beyond our control 
these factors include the general condition of the public equity markets  levels of mergers and acquisitions activity  fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies  and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities 
non marketable equity securities we invest in non marketable equity securities in several ways by direct purchases of preferred or common stock in privately held companies by capital contributions to venture capital funds  which in turn  make investments in preferred or common stock of privately held companies through our venture capital fund  silicon valley bancventures  lp  which makes investments in preferred or common stock of privately held companies through our fund of funds  svb strategic investors fund  lp  which makes investments in venture capital funds  which in turn  invest in privately held companies unexercised warrant securities in private companies are initially recorded at a nominal value on our consolidated balance sheets 
they are carried at this value until they become marketable or expire 
a summary of our accounting policies for other non marketable equity securities is presented in the following table 
a complete description of the accounting policies follows the table 
private equity and venture capital fund investments wholly owned by bancshares cost basis less identified impairment  if any owned by silicon valley bancventures  lp and svb strategic investors fund  lp investment company accounting  adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis through the statement of income bancshares wholly owned non marketable venture capital fund investments and other direct equity investments are recorded on a cost basis as our interests are considered minor because we own less than of the company and have no influence over the company s operating and financial policies 
our cost basis in each investment is reduced by returns until the cost basis of the individual investment is fully recovered 
returns in excess of the cost basis are recorded as investment gains in noninterest income 
the values of the investments are reviewed at least quarterly  giving consideration to the facts and circumstances of each individual investment 
management s review of private equity investments typically includes the relevant market conditions  offering prices  operating results  financial conditions  and exit strategies 
a decline in the fair value that is considered other than temporary is recorded in our consolidated statements of income in the period the impairment occurs 
any estimated loss is recorded in noninterest income as investment losses 
investments held by silicon valley bancventures  lp are recorded at fair value using investment company accounting rules 
the investments consist principally of stock in private companies that are not traded on a public market and are subject to restrictions on resale 
these investments are carried at estimated fair value as determined by the general partner 
the valuation generally remains at cost until such time that there is significant evidence of a change in values based upon consideration of the relevant market conditions  offering prices  operating results  financial conditions  exit strategies  and other pertinent information 
the general partner  silicon valley bancventures  inc is owned and controlled by bancshares and has an ownership interest of in silicon valley bancventures  lp therefore  silicon valley bancventures  lp is fully consolidated and any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in our consolidated statements of income 
the portion of any gains or losses belonging to the limited partners is reflected in minority interest in net losses of consolidated affiliates and adjusts bancshares income to its percentage ownership 
the svb strategic investors fund  lp portfolio consists primarily of investments in venture capital funds  which are recorded at fair value using investment company accounting rules 
the carrying value of the investments is determined by the general partner based on the percentage of svb strategic investors fund  lp s interest in the total fair market value as provided by each venture capital fund investment 
svb strategic investors  llc generally utilizes the fair values assigned to the underlying portfolio investments by the management of the venture capital funds 
the estimated fair value of the investments is determined after giving consideration to the relevant market conditions  offering prices  operating results  financial conditions  exit strategy  and other pertinent information 
the general partner  svb strategic investors  llc  is owned and controlled by bancshares and has an ownership interest of in svb strategic investors fund  lp therefore  svb strategic investors fund  lp is fully consolidated and any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the venture capital fund investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in our consolidated statements of income 
the limited partner s share of any gains or losses is reflected in minority interest in net losses of consolidated affiliates and adjusts bancshares income to its percentage ownership 
we consider our non marketable equity securities accounting policies to be critical  as the timing and amount of gain or losses  if any  from these instruments depend upon factors beyond our control 
these factors include the general condition of the public equity markets  levels of mergers and acquisitions activity  and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities 
therefore  we cannot predict future gains or losses with any degree of accuracy and any gains or losses are likely to vary materially from period to period 
in addition  the valuation of non marketable equity securities included in our financial statements represents our best interpretation of the underlying equity securities performance at this time 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations  the estimated values of these securities may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
allowance for loan losses we consider our accounting policy relating to the estimation of the allowance for loan losses to be critical as estimation of the allowance involves material estimates by our management and is particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term 
we define credit risk as the probability of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
through the administration of loan policies and monitoring of the loan portfolio  our management seeks to reduce such credit risks 
while we follow underwriting and credit monitoring procedures  which we believe are appropriate in growing and managing the loan portfolio  in the event of nonperformance by these other parties  our potential exposure to credit losses could significantly affect our consolidated financial position and earnings 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense to provide for credit risk 
our allowance for loan losses is established for loan losses that are probable but not yet realized 
the process of anticipating loan losses is imprecise 
our management applies the following evaluation process to our loan portfolio to estimate the required allowance for loan losses we maintain a systematic process for the evaluation of individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  each loan in our portfolio is assigned a credit risk rating 
credit risk ratings are assigned on a scale of to  with representing loans with a low risk of nonpayment  representing loans with the highest risk of nonpayment  and representing loans  which have been charged off 
this credit risk rating evaluation process includes  but is not limited to  consideration of such factors as payment status  the financial condition of the borrower  borrower compliance with loan covenants  underlying collateral values  potential loan concentrations  and general economic conditions 
our policies require a committee of senior management to review credit relationships that exceed specific dollar values  at least quarterly 
our review process evaluates the appropriateness of the credit risk rating and allocation of allowance for loan losses  as well as other account management functions 
in addition  our management receives and approves an analysis for all impaired loans  as defined by the sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated based on a formula allocation for similarly risk rated loans  or for specific risk issues  which suggest a probable loss factor exceeding the formula allocation for a specific loan  or for individual impaired loans as determined by sfas no 
our evaluation process was designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we assess the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio by utilizing modeling techniques 
for this purpose  we have developed a statistical model based on historical loan loss migration to estimate an appropriate allowance for outstanding loan balances 
in addition  we apply macro and contingent allocations to the results of the aforementioned model to ascertain the total allowance for loan losses 
while this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance for loan losses  relies  to a great extent  on the judgment and experience of our management 
historical loan loss migration model we use the historical loan loss migration model as a basis for determining expected loan loss factors by credit risk rating category 
the effectiveness of the historical loan loss migration model is predicated on the theory that historical trends are predictive of future experience 
specifically  the model calculates the likelihood and rate of a loan in one risk rating category moving one category lower using loan data from our portfolio 
we analyze the historical loan loss migration trend by compiling gross loan loss data and by credit risk rating for the rolling twelve month periods as of the end of each quarter 
each of the loans charged off over the twelve month period is assigned a credit risk rating at the period end of each of the preceding four quarters 
on an annual basis  the model calculates charged off loans as a percentage of current period end loans by credit risk rating category 
the percentages are averaged and are aggregated to estimate our loan loss factors 
the annual periods reviewed and averaged to form the loan loss factors will be limited to twelve quarters beginning march  when our ten grade risk rating system will have twelve quarters of history 
the current period end client loan balances are aggregated by risk rating category 
loan loss factors for each risk rating category are ultimately applied to the respective period end client loan balances for each corresponding risk rating category  to provide an estimation of the allowance for loan losses 
contingent and macro allocations additionally  we apply a contingent allocation to the results of this model 
our contingent allocation acknowledges that unfunded credit obligations can result in future losses 
unfunded credit obligations at each quarter end are allocated to credit risk rating categories in accordance with the client s credit risk rating 
we provide for the risk of loss on unfunded credit obligations by allocating fixed credit risk rating factors to our unfunded credit obligations 
a macro allocation is calculated each quarter based upon an assessment of the risks that may lead to a loan loss experience different from our historical results 
these risks are aggregated to become our macro allocation 
based on management s prediction or estimates of changing risks in the lending environment  the macro allocation may vary significantly from period to period and includes but is not limited to consideration of the following factors changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collections  charge off and recovery practices changes and development in national and local economic business conditions  including the market and economic condition of our clients industry sectors changes in the nature of our loan portfolio changes in experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans changes in the trend of the volume of nonaccrual loans  troubled debt restructurings and other loan modifications finally  we compute several modified versions of the model  which provide additional assurance that the statistical results of the historical loan loss migration model are reasonable 
our chief credit officer and chief financial officer evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on the results of our analysis 
goodwill goodwill  which arises from the purchase price exceeding the assigned value of the net assets of an acquired business  represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired 
the majority of our goodwill resulted from the acquisition of alliant partners  a mergers and acquisitions firm 
the value of this goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from the acquired businesses 
a decline in earnings as a result of a decline in mergers and acquisitions transaction volume or a decline in the valuations of mergers and acquisitions clients could lead to impairment  which would be recorded as a write down in our consolidated statements of income 
on an annual basis or as circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount 
the evaluation methodology for potential impairments is inherently complex  and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate impairment using a two step process 
first  we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we compare the implied fair value  defined below  of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing goodwill down to the implied fair value 
we primarily use a discounted future cash flows approach to value the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment 
these estimates involve many assumptions  including expected results of operations  assumed discounts rates  and assumed growth rates for the reporting units 
the discount rate used is based on standard industry practice  taking into account the expected equity risk premium  the size of the business  and the probability of the reporting unit achieving its financial forecasts 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in results of operations of the business  economic or political climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of 
more information about goodwill is included in
