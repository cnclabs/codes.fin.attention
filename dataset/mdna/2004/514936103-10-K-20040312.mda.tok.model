item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  the company expanded the breadth of services that it provides to its customers 
as a result  the company is providing information regarding the company s two major business segments  title insurance and lender services 
other non reportable business segments are reported in a category called corporate and other 
these groupings of business units are used by company management to manage the company s operations 
the company s dominant segment is title insurance  which in accounted for of the company s operating revenues 
title insurance our title insurance segment is influenced by the level of real estate activity and the cost and availability of mortgage funds 
revenue for this segment results primarily from resales and refinancing of residential real estate and  to a lesser extent  from commercial transactions and the construction and sale of new housing 
in addition  title insurance revenue is affected by the company s sales and marketing efforts and its strategic decisions based on the rate structure and claims environment in particular markets 
premiums and fees are determined both by competition and by state regulation 
revenue from direct title operations is recognized at the time real estate transactions close 
there can be a several month delay between the time that a title order is opened and the real estate transaction closes 
operating revenues from independent agents are recognized when the company receives notification from the agent that a policy has been issued 
the delay in notification varies from agent to agent and between regions of the country 
during  the company had an average delay from policy issuance to reporting of days 
there can be a significant lag between changes in general real estate activity and their impact on the portion of the company s revenues attributable to agents 
the demand for our title insurance products and services is dependent upon  among other things  the volume of commercial and residential real estate transactions  including mortgage refinancing transactions 
the volume of these transactions has historically been influenced by factors such as interest rates and the state of the overall economy 
for example  when interest rates are increasing or during an economic downturn or recession  real estate activity typically declines and we experience lower revenues and profitability 
the cyclical nature of our business has caused fluctuations in revenues and profitability in the past and is expected to do so in the future 
the company s profit margins are affected by several factors  including the volume of real estate and mortgage refinance activity  title policy type and amount 
volume is an important determinant of profitability because the company  like any other real estate services company  has a significant level of fixed costs arising from personnel  occupancy costs and maintenance of title plants 
the company utilizes orders opened as a forward looking indicator of business volume 
because premiums are based on the face amount of the policy  larger policies generate higher premiums although expenses of issuance do not necessarily increase in proportion to policy size 
cancellations affect profitability because costs incurred both in opening and in processing orders typically are not offset by fees 
the company s largest expense is commissions paid to independent agents 
the company regularly reviews the profitability of its agents  adjusting commission levels or canceling certain agents where profitability objectives are not being met and expanding operations where acceptable levels of profitability are available 
the company continually monitors its operating expenses which are the sum of salaries and employee benefits  agency commissions and other expenses exclusive of interest  amortization and certain other items as a percentage of operating revenues 
generally title insurance claims rates are lower than other types of insurance because title insurance policies insure against prior events affecting the quality of real estate titles rather than against unforeseen  and therefore less predictable  future events 
see critical accounting estimates policy and contract claims for further discussion 
in addition  the company may be subject to claims and litigation other than in the ordinary course of business 
for a discussion of pending legal proceedings  see item legal proceedings 
operating revenues in and the early part of increased primarily due to a favorable residential mortgage interest rate environment and a large volume of mortgage refinancing transactions 
however  the company began to experience a decline in refinancing transactions during the third quarter of and the level of refinancing transactions continued to decline during the fourth quarter of for fiscal year  the company expects that the level of refinancing transactions will be substantially below that experienced in recent years 
this decline in the volume of refinancing transactions is the result of an extended period of declining mortgage interest rates followed by recent increases in those rates 
a significant challenge facing management of the title insurance segment is management of the revenue reductions expected to occur due to the decline in refinancing activity 
as a result  operating results for the years ended and should not be viewed as indicative of results for any future period 
the company has been reducing staffing levels in response to the reduction in refinance transactions 
the company expects to realize the full effect of expense savings from these staffing level reductions in continuing staff reductions and expense management will be an ongoing focus for senior management 
integration of recent and planned future acquisitions  and evaluating new potential acquisitions will also be a significant challenge and opportunity for this segment in lender services our lender services segment provides services to regional and national lending institutions which complement those offered in our title insurance business 
these services consist primarily of real estate tax processing and flood certification services  mortgage credit reporting and default management services 
with the exception of default management  the services provided by this segment are the result of businesses acquired by the company during the company expanded into the business of providing flood certification and real estate tax services to mortgage lenders by purchasing lereta corp 
lereta  one of the largest  most advanced service companies in its industry  on october  the company also entered the credit information business for the mortgage lending industry through its acquisition in august of info holding company  inc the lender services segment realizes a majority of its income through service revenues associated with tracking and reporting of real estate tax payments and flood zone certificiations related to mortgage loans for lending institutions 
the lenders pay for these services at the time they add a loan to their servicing portfolio 
the company defers a significant portion of its revenue received for these services 
as a result  revenue reported in the financial statements represents the amortization of both current and prior service fees and is not representative of new contract sales levels 
expenses on the other hand are charged to the income statement as incurred and are not deferred 
thus  an understanding of the levels of deferred revenues in this area is critical to understanding the relative strength of business related to tax services 
the amortization rates are reviewed regularly to determine if there have been changes in contract lives and or changes in the number or timing of prepayments  and adjusted to reflect current trends 
the company is required in certain instances to reimburse part of the fees should the lender sell the loan to another party 
revenues in the mortgage credit reporting area and default management services are recognized when the report or service is delivered to the customer 
this segment has a substantial opportunity to leverage the company s title insurance business relationships to cross sell services to other financial institutions 
a significant challenge for these businesses will be integration into the company s overall structure without jeopardizing their current business relationships 
corporate and other this group represents business segments that are not significant enough in size to be reported separately 
the businesses reported in this group include residential inspection and commercial appraisals and assessments  orange county bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary  centennial bank  a california industrial bank that the company acquired in november centennial as well as the unallocated portion of the corporate expenses including unallocated interest expense related to the company s corporate offices in richmond  virginia 
centennial provides and purchases in bulk commercial real estate loans to businesses primarily in the southern california marketplace and is dependent on the viability of businesses in the southern california markets in which it operates 
deposits are solicited through the internet for both certificates of deposit and passbook savings accounts 
as an industrial bank  centennial does not accept demand deposits  such as checking accounts  that provide for payment to third parties 
centennial does not offer banking services such as credit cards or automated teller machines 
the company s assessment business is managed by the company s landamerica assessment corporation subsidiary that was acquired in and which is headquartered in california 
this business provides due diligence services to commercial customers throughout the country 
revenue is recognized upon completion of the services to the customer 
the company s residential inspection services are run by the company s inspectech subsidiary 
this rapidly growing subsidiary is one of the largest providers of residential real estate inspections in the country 
its business is highly dependent on the real estate industry and the levels of residential home sales and refinancings 
inspectech charges a flat fee for each transaction which is generally collected at the time of service 
the company s commercial appraisal operations are run by the company s landamerica valuation corporation 
its business is highly dependent on the commercial real estate market 
they charge a fee based on the type and complexity of work performed 
critical accounting estimates this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company considers the following accounting estimates to be critical in preparing and understanding the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
policy and contract claims 
a provision for estimated future claims payments is recorded at the time policy revenue is recorded 
the company s payment experience as well as the industry s extends for more than years after the issuance of a policy 
due to the length of time over which claim payments are made and regularly occurring changes in underlying economic conditions  these estimates are subject to variability 
as general economic conditions decline  claims experience has been shown to deteriorate  leading to increases in such losses as mechanics liens and defalcations 
these factors tend to diminish as economic conditions improve 
loss provision rates are reviewed periodically and adjusted by management as experience develops or new information becomes known 
in establishing loss provision rates  management considers historical experience  current economic conditions and the mix of business 
the company s independent consulting actuaries perform projections of required reserves as considered necessary during the year and at year end 
these projections are compared to recorded reserves to evaluate the adequacy of such recorded reserves and any necessary adjustments are included in current operations 
the impact of a change in the loss rate on current year business volumes is as follows increase in loss rate of decrease in loss rate of purchase accounting  impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
the company  as a normal part of its business  acquires agencies and other title related operations 
in addition  in the company purchased three businesses which were outside its traditional business expertise but primarily focused in the real estate industry 
as a result of these acquisitions  the company assigned fair values to the assets and liabilities purchased and increased the amount of goodwill and other intangibles recorded on its balance sheet 
the company utilizes the services of an independent appraisal company to assist with the allocation of purchase price to acquired assets including goodwill and liabilities 
on january  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived fixed assets 
sfas no 
established new rules for accounting for business combinations and requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method 
sfas no 
eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill and other identified indefinite life intangibles and instead requires that impairment testing be performed at least annually 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite life intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
determination of the amount  if any  of impairment associated with goodwill or other long lived assets is subject to a number of individual criteria  each of which is difficult to value 
deferred tax asset 
net deferred tax assets at december  and relate primarily to policy and contract claims  pension liability  deferred service arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts and employee benefit plans 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the assets will not be realized 
the most significant factor in this determination is the projected future timing and amounts of taxable income 
the provision of a valuation allowance would reduce net income in the period recorded 
based upon our historical results of operations  the existing financial condition of the company and management s assessment of all other available evidence  management believes that these assets will more likely than not be realized 
pension 
the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan which is valued annually by an actuary 
the valuation is dependent on significant assumptions 
one significant assumption is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the use of expected long term rates of return may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than actual returns in any given year 
over time the expected returns are used to approximate actual long term returns which result in a pattern of expense recognition that more closely matches the service lives of typical employees 
the company uses long term and actual historical returns  current and targeted asset mix and future estimates of long term investment returns to develop its long term return for plan assets 
the company s anticipated rate of return was as of the valuation date 
another significant assumption in valuing the pension liability is the discount rate 
the discount rate utilized is based on rates on high quality fixed income debt instruments available at the end of each valuation period 
the company utilized a discount rate of in determining its benefit obligations 
changing the discount rate or long term rate of return would result in the following impact on the pension benefit liability projected benefit obligation increase of in discount rate decrease of in discount rate deferred service arrangements 
when the company acquired lereta on october   all of lereta s assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair value in accordance with sfas no 
in making these adjustments  lereta s deferred revenue account  representing amounts which had been deferred and would have been amortized over the remaining lives of the contracts for the provision of real estate tax monitoring and flood certification services existing at the acquisition date  was eliminated 
the deferred revenue account was replaced with an account called deferred service obligations representing the estimated fair value of the obligation to provide the required services over the remaining life of the subject contracts 
this account  established as of the acquisition date  is being amortized over the remaining lives of existing contracts 
as previously noted  real estate tax monitoring and flood certification fees received on new contracts entered into since the acquisition date are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts to which they relate 
the sum of amortization of the initial deferred service obligation and amortization related to fees accrued on new contracts represent the earned fee amount reported as revenue for the period 
the amortization period for the purchase date deferred service obligation and for deferred revenue is determined using historical experience and information available from outside sources 
amortization rates are reviewed regularly and adjusted as necessary to reflect changes in contract lives or prepayment rates 
seasonality the title insurance business is closely related to the overall level of residential and commercial real estate activity  which is generally affected by the relative strength or weakness of the united states economy 
in addition  title insurance volumes fluctuate based on the effect changes in interest rates have on the level of real estate activity 
periods of increasing interest rates  usually have an adverse impact on real estate activity and therefore premium and fee revenues 
in contrast  real estate activity usually increases when interest rates fall 
in and the company and the title insurance industry benefited from the lowest interest rates in the last years 
historically  residential real estate activity has been generally slower in the winter  when fewer families buy or sell homes  with increased volumes in the spring and summer 
residential refinancing activity is generally more uniform throughout the seasons  but is subject to interest rate variability 
the company s title insurance segment typically reports its lowest revenues in the first quarter  with revenues increasing into the second quarter and through the third quarter 
the fourth quarter customarily may be as strong as the third quarter  depending on the level of activity in the commercial real estate market 
however  in and the company s fourth quarter revenues were stronger than the third quarter due to increased activity in the residential real estate market related to refinance activity 
the company s lender services segment has similar seasonal trending 
however  due to the nature of the revenue deferrals made in this segment  as noted above  the impact on the company s results of operations will differ 
in instances where the company receives cash in advance for services for real estate tax payment and flood certification services  the revenue is deferred and amortized ratably over the anticipated life of the loan servicing 
this ratable amortization has the impact of reducing the volatility in revenue related to this segment 
in the through period  the typical seasonality of the title insurance business was influenced by changes in the levels of refinancing activity 
for additional information  see item business cyclicality and seasonality 
results of operations operating revenues 
a summary of the company s operating revenues is as follows dollars in thousands title insurance direct operations agency operations lender services corporate and other total title insurance operating revenues from direct title operations increased in over and in over the increase in was due to a increase in the number of title policies issued by the company s direct operations offset by a slight decrease in the premiums per policy issued 
the decrease in the premium per policy issued is due to the large volume of refinancing activity in  which resulted in a slightly lower premium per policy 
the increase of over was due to a increase in the number of policies issued offset by reductions in ancillary service revenues 
policies issued by the company s direct title operations were   and  during  and respectively 
average mortgage interest rates for year fixed rate mortgages for  and were  and  respectively 
the average premium per policy issued was in  in and in the fluctuations noted in issued policies and average revenues per policy issued were primarily attributable to the relative changes in real estate activity year over year  as mentioned above 
operating revenues from agency title operations increased by in over and in over these increases were primarily attributable to the same factors affecting direct title operations and by the inherent delay in the reporting of transactions by agents 
as noted above  the timing of policy reporting  and therefore revenue reporting by agents  differs in various parts of the country 
lender services operating revenues in the lender services segment increased substantially in and as compared to prior years 
the primary reason for the increase in was the purchase of info in august and lereta in october the real estate tax processing and flood certification business receives cash in advance for products that require them to provide service over the life of the loan 
in the last quarter of  the company s real estate tax processing services had gross receipts of million dollars and deferred revenue recognition for million of these receipts 
the company amortized approximately million of its deferred service obligation related to pre and post acquisition life of loan services of lereta during the fourth quarter of this deferred service obligation represents the amount of revenue that will be recognized over the anticipated service life of contracts acquired with lereta 
the company began operations in the default management services area in corporate and other operating revenues in corporate and other increased by million in over and decreased by million in over the primary reason for the increase in revenue in over is due to increases in the residential inspection and commercial appraisal and assessment businesses of million as well as an increase of million related to an increase in the equity in unconsolidated subsidiaries  offset by a reduction in revenues of million related to the residential appraisal business that the company exited in similarly  the decrease in over relates to increases in the residential inspection and commercial appraisal and assessment businesses in as well as a million increase in equity in unconsolidated subsidiaries  offset by a reduction in revenues of million related to the residential appraisal business 
investment and other income

the increase of million in compared to is primarily due to the company s sale of a portion of their fixed maturity security portfolio to provide funding for the acquisitions consummated during the increase of million in as compared to is due to increases in the sales prices of the company s fixed maturity securities as a result of the reduction of interest rates in the marketplace 
salaries and employee benefits 
a summary of the company s salaries and other personnel costs is as follows dollars in thousands title insurance lender services corporate and other total title insurance the company s title insurance segment accounted for approximately of the company s total salaries and other personnel costs in the title insurance segment  in particular direct operations  is labor intensive and as a result a significant variable expense component for this segment is salaries and other personnel costs 
we manage our personnel expenses to reflect changes in the level of activity in the real estate market 
as a result  our employee base expands and contracts over time 
in order to manage personnel costs more effectively throughout the real estate cycle  we use temporary or part time employees where appropriate to staff operations so that we can respond promptly to changes in real estate activity 
we anticipate that the title insurance segment s portion of total personnel costs will decrease as a percentage of total personnel costs as the company continues to diversify 
as a result of anticipated reductions in refinance activity due to increases in interest rates  the company has been and will continue to reduce the number of employees in this segment 
depending on the rapidity of the change in real estate activity  the company may be unable to match increasing or decreasing levels of title orders with staffing levels 
in periods of declining activity  personnel costs as a percentage of revenue  may increase 
title insurance salaries and employee benefit costs increased million  or  in over and million  or  in over the increase of million in over was primarily related to compensation increases associated with the increase in business volumes and increased commission expense for internal sales personnel 
the company also had an increase in its pension expense of approximately million see additional information in note to the consolidated financial statements 
average full time equivalent fte counts for the year totaled  in versus  in additionally  the company had increased costs of approximately million related to acquisitions in the current year 
the increase of over is due to a million increase in incentive compensation due to higher business volumes and increases in the company s contribution to health care benefit plans and its k match 
the increase in incentive compensation is due to bonuses paid relative to the company s operating profits as well as operational efficiencies achieved 
the increase in the company s k match is related to the company s discretionary matching component which changes in correlation to the company s operating results 
the company s average fte count was  in versus  in lender services lender services compensation expenses increased in both and the company acquired lereta and info in october and august  respectively 
personnel costs in the lender services segment tend to increase during periods of increased sales volume and decrease when sales volume is lower 
this is the case because a significant amount of work is required to set up new accounts 
once accounts are established  monitoring and maintenance activities are less labor intensive 
corporate and other corporate and other salary and benefit costs increased million  or in over and decreased million in over the increase in salaries and benefit costs in over relate to increase in employees at the company s shared resources facility required due to growth in the company s infrastructure  primarily in the information technology area  an increase in incentive compensation as a result of the company s financial performance  as well as continued expansion of the company s other services an increase of million  offset by the termination of the business of primis  inc  the company s web based provider of real estate services  of million see additional information under exit and termination costs below 
the decrease in over in corporate and other compensation expense relates to reduced personnel costs associated with the primis business of million  offset somewhat by million in new businesses created by the residential inspection and commercial appraisal and assessment businesses 
these businesses increased fte headcount by employees in agent commissions 
a summary of agent commissions and revenues related to the title insurance segment is as follows dollars in thousands agent commission agent revenues retained by agents the commission rate paid to agents varies by geographic area in which the commission was paid and by individual agent agreement 
the trend of increasing commission rates is attributable to increased competition for agents

claims paid as a percentage of title insurance operating revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
the adverse development on prior year loss reserves during was attributable to the emergence of a few large claims for policy years and reserves for policy years and prior developed favorably in the favorable development on prior year loss reserves during and was attributable to lower than expected payment levels on recent issue years which included a high proportion of refinance business 
the company believes that the loss ratio will generally decrease over the next year 
exit and termination costs 
the company incurred exit and termination costs on a pre tax basis of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in october  the company acquired primis  inc  a web based provider of real estate services 
in  the acceptance of primis technology by our customer base proved to be much slower than anticipated  necessitating a fourth quarter non cash writeoff of intangibles  including goodwill  acquired in the acquisition 
in connection with the fourth quarter non cash writeoff of million  the company incurred certain termination costs associated with facility and employee rationalization programs 
additionally  on june   the company entered into a joint venture agreement with the first american corporation to combine its residential real estate valuation operations 
under the terms of the agreement  the company contributed its former primis residential appraisal production division to first american s eappraiseit subsidiary 
in connection with the transaction  the company exited the residential appraisal production business which had been unprofitable and recorded a charge of million for exit  termination and other costs during finally  in  the company continued to rationalize and consolidate certain office space

the company took a charge to earnings to reflect the dimunition in value associated with these plants 
amortization 
amortization expense increased substantially in over and decreased in from the increase in is related to the acquisition of approximately million in businesses during and the related amortizable intangible assets acquired as a result of these acquisitions

these increases were offset by lower levels of borrowings on the company s other credit facilities 
the decrease in from was the result of lower levels of borrowings outstanding 
premium taxes 
insurers are generally not subject to state income or franchise taxes 
however  they are subject to a premium tax on certain operating revenues  depending on the state 
tax rates and their application to operating revenues to vary from state to state

in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which is effective for periods after december  the statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
previously  these liabilities were required to be accrued at the time management committed to an activity 
costs required to be accrued included but are not limited to termination benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated  costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease  and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
the company adopted this statement in without a material impact to operating results 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation fin no  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
prior to this interpretation  entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise when the enterprise had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
the company adopted the provisions of this interpretation in the fourth quarter of related to its ownership interests in entities entered into prior to february  and in the second quarter of for entities entered into subsequent to february  there was no material impact to the company s financial condition or results of operations resulting from implementation of this interpretation

the principal non operating uses of cash and cash equivalents for the three year period ending december  were for acquisitions  capital expenditures  additions to the investment portfolio and the repayment of debt 
the most significant non operating sources of cash and invested cash were the proceeds from the issuance in of the company s million convertible senior debentures due  and the issuance in of million of senior notes through a private placement which was used to repay outstanding debt on the company s revolving credit facility and the proceeds from the sales and maturities of certain investments 
the net of all activities was to increase cash and invested cash by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
as of december   the company held cash and invested cash of million and fixed maturity securities of  million 
as noted above  the company s operating results and cash flows are heavily dependent on the real estate market  particularly in the title insurance segment 
while the company has continued to diversify its product portfolio over the last several years  a significant downturn in the real estate market would adversely impact the company s cash flows 
the company s business is labor intensive and changes to the real estate market are monitored closely and staffing levels are adjusted accordingly 
there is typically a lag between changes in the real estate market and changes in personnel levels resulting in higher personnel costs in periods where the real estate market declines in advance of headcount reductions 
the lender services segment provides real estate tax payment and flood certification services for the life of loans for which it receives cash at loan closing 
this revenue related to the long term servicing is deferred and amortized over the life of the loan 
revenues  cash receipts and loans in the company s industrial bank subsidiary are not dependent on the real estate industry but are dependent on the ability of the bank to attract deposits and qualified commercial customers 
the company believes that its product diversification efforts along with its management of operating expenses and significant working capital position will enhance its ability to manage cash resources through declines in the real estate market 
the company has acquired  or entered into agreements to acquire  several businesses 
during  the company completed acquisitions of approximately million 
the purchases were funded through a mixture of cash  invested cash  investments and utilization of the companies various credit facilities 
the company has entered into an agreement to purchase a title agency in the southern california marketplace that is expected to close in the first half of for a purchase price of approximately million 
the company will continue to selectively evaluate additional acquisitions should attractive candidates be identified 
on november   the company entered into a new five year credit arrangement with suntrust bank  individually and as administrative agent for a syndicate of selected other banks  pursuant to which a credit facility  in the aggregate principal amount of up to million  was established 
this line of credit replaced the company s prior six year credit facility with bank of america that expired on november  the company has million available under the facility as of december  the facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including a minimum debt to capital ratio  an interest coverage ratio and maintenance of statutory surplus 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december additionally  in the fourth quarter of  the company privately issued million of its convertible senior debentures due the company utilized the proceeds from this issue for general corporate purposes including financing on a long term basis a portion of the purchase price of certain of the acquisitions noted above 
the debentures are initially convertible into common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the debentures 
for additional information see part ii  item recent sales of unregistered securities

forward looking and cautionary statements certain information contained in this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of among other things  these statements relate to the financial condition  results of operation and future business plans  operations  opportunities and prospects of the company 
in addition  the company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements  including statements contained in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in its reports to shareholders 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by the use of words such as we expect  believe  anticipate  estimate or words of similar import 
these forward looking statements are based upon management s current knowledge and assumptions about future events and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
further  any such statement is specifically qualified in its entirety by the cautionary statements set forth in the following paragraphs 
factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements include the following the company s results of operations and financial condition are susceptible to changes in mortgage interest rates and general economic conditions 
the demand for the company s title insurance and other real estate transaction products and services is dependent upon  among other things  the volume of commercial and residential real estate transactions  including mortgage refinancing transactions 
the volume of these transactions has historically been influenced by factors such as interest rates and the state of the overall economy 
for example  when interest rates are increasing or during an economic downturn or recession  real estate activity typically declines and the company tends to experience lower revenues and profitability 
the cyclical nature of the company s business has caused fluctuations in revenues and profitability in the past and is expected to do so in the future 
in addition  changes in interest rates may have an adverse impact on the company s return on invested cash  the market value of its investment portfolio and interest paid on its bank debt 
our operating revenues for the year ended december  increased by over the same period last year  primarily due to a favorable residential mortgage interest rate environment and a large volume of mortgage refinancing transactions 
however  the company began to experience a decline in refinancing transactions during the third quarter of that continued during the fourth quarter of the year 
for fiscal year  we expect that the level of refinancing transactions will be substantially below that experienced in recent years 
this decline in the volume of refinancing transactions is the result of an extended period of declining mortgage interest rates followed by recent increases in those rates 
the company has been reducing our staffing levels in response to the reduction in refinance transactions 
the company expects to realize the full effect of expense savings from these staffing level reductions in as a result  operating results for the years ended and should not be viewed as indicative of results for any future period 
the company s inability to manage successfully its acquisitions of complementary businesses could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
an element of the company s business strategy is to expand the services it provides through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
during  the company acquired several businesses outside of its traditional business operations  including lereta  info and centennial  previously described in item above 
the businesses of lereta  info and centennial are different from each other and from the business of providing title insurance and related services 
the company also may in the future acquire other businesses outside of its traditional business operations  although no assurances can be given that the company will do so or that it will continue to acquire such companies at the levels experienced during such acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the company s inexperience in managing businesses that provide products and services beyond its traditional business  new regulatory requirements  diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key acquired personnel  failure to effectively integrate operations  company cultures and services  increased costs to improve managerial  operational  financial and administrative systems  legal liabilities  and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
in addition  there can be no assurance that acquired businesses will achieve anticipated levels of revenues  earnings or performance 
the failure of the company to manage its acquisitions successfully could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
competition in the company s industry affects its revenues 
the business of providing real estate transaction products and services is very competitive 
competition for residential title insurance business is based primarily on price and quality of service 
with respect to national and regional mortgage lenders  service quality includes a large distribution network and the ability to deliver a broad array of real estate services quickly  efficiently and through a single point of contact 
competition for commercial title business is based primarily on price  service  expertise in complex transactions and the size and financial strength of the insurer 
title insurance underwriters also compete for agents on the basis of service and commission levels 
although the company is one of the largest providers of real estate transaction products and services in the united states  four other companies fidelity national financial  inc  the first american corporation  old republic international corporation and stewart information services  inc have the size  capital base and agency networks to compete effectively with the company s products and services 
in addition  some of the company s competitors may have  or will have in the future  greater capital and other resources than the company 
competition among the major providers of real estate transaction products and services and any new entrants could adversely affect the company s revenues and profitability 
significant industry changes and new product and service introductions require timely and cost effective responses 
as a national provider of real estate transaction products and services  the company participates in an industry that is subject to significant change  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
in addition  alternatives to traditional title insurance  such as lien protection products  have emerged in recent years 
the company believes that its future success will depend on its ability to anticipate changes in technology and customer preferences and to offer products and services that meet evolving standards on a timely and cost effective basis 
the development and implementation of new products and services may require significant capital expenditures and other resources 
there is a risk that customers may not accept the company s new product and service offerings and the company may not successfully identify new product and service opportunities or develop and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost effective manner 
in addition  products and services that the company s competitors and other real estate industry participants develop or introduce may render certain of the company s products and services obsolete or noncompetitive 
advances in technology could also reduce the useful lives of the company s products  preventing the company from recovering fully its investment in particular products and services 
as a result  the inability of the company to anticipate industry changes and to respond with competitive and profitable products and services may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the company may not succeed in implementing its strategy of becoming a major provider of real estate transaction management services 
one of the company s business strategies is to expand its capabilities to manage the delivery of multiple services required in real estate transactions through a centralized source  and to significantly grow the volume of transactions that it manages 
there is a risk that the company s transaction management services may fail to gain market acceptance  particularly from the large national mortgage originators 
furthermore  there are relatively low barriers to entry into the market for real estate transaction management  as opposed to the regulated title insurance business  which may result in a large number of competitors  including large national mortgage originators and others having substantially greater financial resources 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to government regulation 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the state insurance authorities of the various states in which they transact business 
these regulations are generally intended for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders 
the nature and extent of these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  but typically involve regulation of dividend payments and other transactions between affiliates prior approval of the acquisition and control of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company regulation of certain transactions entered into by an insurance company with any of its affiliates approval of premium rates for insurance standards of solvency and minimum amounts of capital surplus that must be maintained limitations on types and amounts of investments restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company licensing of insurers and agents deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders approval of policy forms methods of accounting establishing reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses regulation of underwriting and marketing practices regulation of reinsurance filing of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition and other matters these regulations may impede  or impose burdensome conditions on  rate increases or other actions that the company might want to take to enhance its operating results 
in addition  state regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of insurance companies 
the company s litigation risks include substantial claims by large classes of claimants 
from time to time the company is involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business 
in addition  the company currently is and has been in the past been subject to claims and litigation not arising in the ordinary course of business from large classes of claimants seeking substantial damages 
material pending legal proceedings not arising in the ordinary course of business are disclosed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission
