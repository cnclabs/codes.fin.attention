item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview background the following discussion presents information about our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
substantially all of our operations are conducted by the bank  and the bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues and operating costs 
the bank was incorporated in and began operations in the company was incorporated in january for the purpose of becoming a holding company for and acquiring all of the outstanding shares of the bank  which occurred in june prior to the acquisition of the bank  the company conducted no business operations and  as a result  for accounting purposes the company s inception and commencement of its operations are deemed to be the inception of the bank in and the commencement of its operations in  respectively 
forward looking information 
this discussion contains information regarding operating trends and our beliefs and expectations regarding our future financial performance and future financial condition which is referred to as forward looking information 
that information is subject to the uncertainties and risks described below in this section of this report under the caption uncertainties and risks that could affect our future financial performance 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and general practices in the banking industry 
the accounting policies we follow in determining the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses and the fair value of derivative financial instruments involve judgments and assumptions which can have a material impact on the carrying value of our loans and those financial instruments  respectively and  as a result  we consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we use historical loss factors  adjusted for current trends and other economic indicators  to determine the inherent losses that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual loan losses could be greater than that predicted by those loss factors and our assessments of current trends and conditions 
in such an event  we would be required to increase the allowance for loan losses by means of a charge to income referred to in our financial statements as the provision for loan losses 
such an increase would reduce the carrying value of our loans on our balance sheet  and the additional provision for loan losses taken to increase that allowance would reduce our income  in the period when it is determined that an increase in the allowance for loan losses is necessary 
see provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses below 
derivative financial instruments 
the derivative financial instruments that we enter into consist primarily of interest rate lock commitments that are designed to hedge mortgage loans held for sale and mortgage loan funding commitments 
at december   approximately million of mortgage loans held for sale and million of mortgage loan commitments were hedged 
we estimate the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and mortgage loan funding commitments based on period end market interest rates obtained from various mortgage investors 
if the fair values of the mortgage loans held for sale or of the mortgage loan funding commitments were to decline below those estimated values  we would be required to reduce the carrying values of the loans held for sale and mortgage loan commitments on our statement of financial condition and  correspondingly  reduce our noninterest income 

table of contents overview of fiscal operating results the following table sets forth information regarding the interest income that we generated  the interest expense that we incurred  our net interest income and our net income and net income per share in the years ended december   and year ended december  amount percent change amount percent change amount dollars in thousands except per share data interest income interest expense net interest income net income net income per share diluted the increase in net income in as compared to was primarily attributable to increase in net interest income 
an increase in net interest income of million  or  in fiscal  primarily as a result of increases in the volume of interest earning assets  including a million  or  increase in our average volume of outstanding loans inclusive of mortgages held for sale  and an increase of million in the average volume of securities available for sale  during fiscal over fiscal increase in noninterest income 
an increase of million  or  in noninterest income  to million in fiscal from million in the corresponding period of fiscal  primarily as a result of a substantial increase in mortgage loan originations 
improvement in efficiency ratio 
a slowing in the rate of growth of noninterest expense which contributed to an improvement in our efficiency ratio noninterest expense expressed as a percentage of the sum of net interest income and noninterest income to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal although net income and income per share declined in as compared to  that decline was attributable to the fact that in we made a provision for income taxes of million  whereas in operating results benefited from a  tax benefit for the year 
consequently  pre tax income actually doubled in fiscal to nearly million from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of increase in net interest income 
an increase in net interest income of nearly million  or approximately  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was primarily attributable to a increase in the average volume of outstanding loans to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  as fiscal included  for the first time  a full year of operations of our costa mesa and beverly hills financial centers that were opened in mid and seven months of operations of our la jolla financial center  and increase in noninterest income 
an increase in noninterest income of million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due largely to an increase in residential mortgage originations by our mortgage loan division that was attributable primarily to declining mortgage interest rates 

table of contents set forth below are certain key financial performance ratios and other financial data for the periods indicated year ended december  return on average assets return on average shareholders equity ratio of average equity to average assets net interest margin results of operations net interest income one of the principal determinants of a bank s income is net interest income  which is the difference between i the interest that a bank earns on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  on the one hand  and ii its interest expense  which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on other interest bearing liabilities  on the other hand 
a bank s interest income and interest expense are  in turn  affected by a number of factors  some of which are outside of its control  including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve the federal reserve board or the frb  which affect interest rates  the demand for loans  and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets  is a banking organization s net interest margin 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  net interest income increased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal of  primarily as a result of a million  or  increase in interest income that more than offset a million  or increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of interest earning assets during  including a million increase in the average volume of outstanding loans including mortgages held for sale and a million increase in the average volume of securities available for sale during fiscal over the corresponding fiscal those volume related increases in interest earning assets  which enabled us to offset to a significant extent the impact of declining interest rates on our interest income  were funded primarily by the increase in deposits and in borrowings we obtained from the federal home loan bank and a shift of funds out of lower yielding federal funds sold during fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in the average volume of interest bearing deposits at the bank  a million increase in the average volume of federal home loan bank borrowings  and interest paid on the million of trust preferred securities issued during the second half of  which more than offset the effect on interest expense of declining market rates in our net interest margin for fiscal declined to from in fiscal this decline was due to further decreases in market rates of interest  primarily as a result of the reductions in the prime lending rates during and  and an acceleration in fiscal of premium amortization on mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio  which resulted in a million rate related decrease in interest earned on securities available for sale during the year 
fiscal compared to fiscal in  we generated net interest income of million as compared to million in this increase was largely attributable to an increase in interest income of million in as compared to  which more than offset the increase in our interest expense in the same period of million 
the increase in interest income in was largely attributable to i an increase of million in the average volume of securities available for sale and stock owned for the year  which generated million of additional interest income  and ii an increase of million in our average loans outstanding for the year  which generated million of additional interest income for the year ended december  as compared to the volume increases in our interest earning assets in were funded primarily by an increase in deposits and in borrowings we obtained from the federal home loan bank and a shift of funds out of lower yielding federal funds sold 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase of million in our average interest bearing deposits  which was partially offset by declining rates of interest that we paid on those deposits and other interest bearing liabilities from in to in

table of contents the following table set forth changes in interest income  including loan fees  and interest paid in each of the years ended december   as compared to and compared to and the extent to which those changes were attributable to changes in the volume and rates of interest earning assets and in the volume and rates of interest bearing liabilities 
changes in interest earned and interest paid due to both rate and volume have been allocated to the change due to volume and the change due to rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the changes in each

the million increase in the volume variance was attributable to an increase in average earning assets of million offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million at december  as compared to december  the decline in the rate variance of million is related to our net interest margin decreasing in to from in  primarily as a result of the impact on interest rates of the federal reserve board s monetary policy and the slowness in the economy  which adversely affected the yields on average earning assets 
the rate on earning assets declined by basis points  from in fiscal  to in fiscal  as compared to an improvement in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities by basis points from in fiscal  to in fiscal thus compressing the net interest margins in the company s net interest income improved by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the volume variance was an increase of million  while the rate variance decreased by million 
the decrease in the rate variance of million represented the decline in net interest margin to in from in primarily as a result of the impact of the federal reserve board s monetary policy and slowdown of the economy after september  provision for loan losses like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining a reserve or allowance the allowance for possible losses on loans that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
when it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced to what management believes is its realizable value 
this reduction  which is referred to as a loan charge off  or write down is charged against that allowance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is increased periodically i to replenish the allowance after it has been reduced due to loan charge offs  ii to reflect changes in the volume of outstanding loans  and iii to take account of changes in the risk of potential losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans or changes in economic conditions 
see financial condition allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below in this section of this report 
increases in the allowance for loan losses are made through a charge  recorded as an expense in the statement of operations referred to as the provision for loan losses 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added back to and  therefore  have the effect of increasing  the allowance for loan losses 
although we employ economic models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines and industry standards to evaluate and determine the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses and  thereby  the amount of the provisions required to be made for potential loan losses  those determinations involve judgments or trends in current economic conditions and other events that can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations 
future economic conditions are subject to a number of uncertainties  some of which are outside of our ability to control 
see the discussion below in this section under the caption risks and uncertainties that could affect our future financial performance we could incur losses on the loans we make 
in the event of unexpected subsequent events or changes in circumstances  it could become necessary in the future to incur additional charges to increase the allowance for loan losses  which would have the effect of reducing our income or which might cause us to incur losses 

table of contents in addition  the federal reserve board and the california department of financial institutions  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require the bank to make additional provisions  over and above those made by management 
the following table sets forth the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december  and december  year ended december  dollars in thousands total gross loans outstanding at end of period average total loans outstanding for the period allowance for loan losses at beginning of period loans charged off recoveries provision for loan losses charges to operating expense allowance for loan losses at end of period allowance for loan losses as a percentage of average total loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total outstanding loans at end of period net charge offs as a percentage of average total loans net charge offs as a percentage of total loans outstanding at end of period net loans charged off to allowance for loan losses net loans charged off to provision for loan losses includes net deferred loan costs and excludes loans held for sale 
the increase in the provision for loan losses in to million from  in was made primarily in response to the growth in the volume of our outstanding loans and  to a much lesser extent  to an increase in nonperforming loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses represented of our gross loans  as compared to of gross loans outstanding at december  in each case  excluding loans held for sale 
during the year ended december   we made provisions for loan losses of  as compared to  for in response to the growth in the volume of our outstanding loans during noninterest income noninterest income consists primarily of mortgage banking income which includes loan origination and processing fees and service released premiums and net gains on sales of loans held for sale  which are generated by our mortgage loan division 
that division  which we established during fiscal  originates conforming and non conforming  agency quality  residential first and home equity mortgage loans 
the volume of residential mortgage refinancings is subject to significant fluctuations as interest rates change 
therefore  changes in interest rates can impact our loan origination and processing fees and yield spread premiums 
for example  the decline in mortgage rates which has occurred over the past two years resulted in increased demand for mortgage loan refinancings 
conversely  a constant or increasing interest rate environment would generally cause a decline in loan refinancings and  therefore  corresponding declines in the volume of mortgage loan originations and in the income that the mortgage banking division would be able to generate 
we seek to manage the impact of changes in interest rates by seeking to originate mortgages for home purchases which are not as interest rate sensitive as mortgage loan refinancings 
mortgage loans for home purchases accounted for approximately of our mortgage loans fundings in the year ended december  and approximately of our mortgage loan fundings in the year ended december  the following table identifies the components of and the percentage changes in noninterest income in  as compared to

in  the remaining reserve was reduced by  to  based on an estimate of the remaining risk of losses from such claims 
other operating expense primarily consists of telephone  courier charges  insurance premiums  postage  customer expenses  and correspondent bank fees 

table of contents as indicated in the table above  salaries and employee benefits constitute the largest components of noninterest expense 
the increase in salaries and employee expenses in  which accounted for of the increase in noninterest expense in  was primarily attributable to the expansion of the financial centers that we established in and an expansion of our mortgage lending division to take advantage of increased mortgage refinancing demand in the increases in salary and employee benefit  occupancy  equipment and depreciation and data processing expenses in were primarily attributable to i the opening of a new financial center in la jolla  california and a new loan production office in la habra  california and  to a much lesser extent  the commencement of operations of a new securities brokerage subsidiary in  and ii a full year of operations of two new financial centers in costa mesa and beverly hills  california and the establishment of our new headquarters offices in costa mesa  which took place in the second and third quarters of also contributing to the increase in noninterest expense in were professional fees and related expenses incurred in connection with credit card refund claims in the bank s merchant processing department 
our ability to control noninterest expense in relation to the level of net revenue net interest income plus noninterest income can be measured in terms of noninterest expenses as a percentage of net revenue 
this is known as the efficiency ratio and indicates the percentage of revenue that is used to cover expenses 
in the year ended december   our efficiency ratio improved to from for the year ended december  in  our efficiency ratio was  as compared to for these decreases indicated that a proportionately smaller amount of net revenue was needed to cover noninterest expenses arising from our day to day operations 
financial condition assets our total consolidated assets increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  that increase was funded by increases in deposits and borrowings which were used primarily to fund loans and purchases of investment securities and to sell federal funds to other banks

real estate loans are loans secured by trust deeds on real property  including commercial property and single family and multi family residences 
construction loans are interim loans to finance specific construction projects 
consumer loans include installment loans to consumers

table of contents allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses the allowance at december  was million  which represented about of the loans then outstanding at december   as compared to million  or  of the loans outstanding at december   in each case exclusive of loans held for sale 
we carefully monitor changing economic conditions  the loan portfolio by category  the financial condition of borrowers  the history of the loan portfolio  and we follow bank regulatory guidelines in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio 
however  as the volume of loans increases  additional provisions for loan losses will be required to maintain the allowance at adequate levels 
additionally  the allowance was established on the basis of estimates and judgments regarding such matters as economic conditions and trends and the condition of borrowers  historical industry loan loss data and regulatory guidelines  and actual loan losses in the future may vary from the losses predicted on the basis of those estimates  judgments and guidelines 
therefore  if economic conditions were to deteriorate  or interest rates were to increase  which would have the effect of increasing the risk that borrowers would encounter difficulty meeting their loan obligations  it could become necessary to increase the allowance by means of additional provisions for loan losses 
see results of operations provision for loan losses above 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific loan categories at the dates indicated 
the allocations presented should not be interpreted as an indication that loans charged to the allowance for loan losses will occur in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category represents the total amount available for future losses that may occur within these categories as the total allowance is applicable to the entire loan portfolio 
december  allowance for loan losses of allowance to category of loans allowance for loan losses of allowance to category of loans dollars in thousands real estate loans commercial loans construction loans consumer loans total specific allocations are identified by loan category and allocated according to charge off data pertaining to the banking industry 
substantially all of the loans in the loan portfolio are graded and incorporated in the process of assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered sufficient to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
non performing loans 
we also measure and establish reserves for loan impairments on a loan by loan basis using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we exclude from our impairment calculations smaller  homogeneous loans such as consumer installment loans and lines of credit 
also  loans that experience insignificant payment delays or payment shortfalls are generally not considered impaired 
we cease accruing interest  and therefore classify as nonaccrual  any loan as to which principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more  or if repayment in full of interest or principal is not expected 
at december   we had million of commercial loans that were delinquent days or more and classified as nonaccrual and impaired loans  for which we have measured and established a reserve which is included as part of our allowance for loan losses based on the fair value of the collateral securing those loans 
at december  there was only a  consumer loan that was delinquent days or more and classified as a nonaccrual loan 
we had no loans delinquent days or more with principal still accruing interest or any restructured loans either at december  or december  at december   the bank had an average investment in impaired loans on a year to date basis of  the interest that we would have earned in had the impaired loans remained current in accordance with their original terms was

by comparison  certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more comprised million  and million of total deposits at december  and  respectively 
the change in the mix of noninterest bearing demand deposits to total deposits during from was largely the result of the increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits 
set forth below is a maturity schedule of domestic time certificates of deposit outstanding at december  and december  december  december  maturities certificates of deposit under certificates of deposit  or more certificates of deposit under certificates of deposit  or more in thousands three months or less over three and through twelve months over twelve months total liquidity we actively manage our liquidity needs to insure sufficient funds are available to meet the ongoing needs of the bank s customers 
we project the future sources and uses of funds and maintain sufficient liquid funds for unanticipated events 
our primary sources of cash include payments on loans  the sale or maturity of investments and growth in deposits 
the primary uses of cash include funding new loans and making advances on existing lines of credit  purchasing investments  including securities available for sale  funding deposit withdrawals and paying operating expenses 
we maintain funds in overnight federal funds and other short term investments to provide for short term liquidity needs 
we also have obtained credit lines from the federal home loan bank and other financial institutions to meet any additional liquidity requirements 
cash flow from financing activities 
cash flow of million was provided by financing activities during the year ended december   primarily representing an increase in deposits  borrowings  and the proceeds from the sale of common stock in our public offering completed in december cash flow from operating activities 
cash flow provided by operating activities  primarily representing the proceeds from sales of loans held for sale  somewhat offset by originations of loans held for sale  totaled million 
cash flow used for investing 
cash flow used in investing activities  primarily to purchase investment securities available for sale  and to fund increases in loans  offset somewhat by proceeds from sales of and principal payments received on investment securities available for sale  totaled million in the year ended december  
table of contents our liquid assets  which included cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  interest earning deposits with financial institutions and unpledged securities available for sale excluding federal reserve bank stock and federal home loan bank stock totaled million or of total assets at december  and million or of total assets at december  the relationship between gross loans and total deposits provides a useful measure of our liquidity 
since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources  the higher the loan to deposit ratio the less liquid are our assets 
on the other hand  since we realize greater yields and higher interest income on loans than we do on investments  a lower loan to deposit ratio can adversely affect interest income and earnings 
as a result  our goal is to achieve a loan to deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on assets 
at december   the ratio of loans to deposits excluding loans held for sale was  compared to at december  borrowings 
as of december   we had long term borrowings of million obtained from the federal home loan bank 
million of these long term advances will mature within one year

during  the highest amount of borrowings outstanding at any month end consisted of million of advances from the federal home loan bank of which million was short term  million in overnight federal funds purchased  and million of overnight borrowings in the form of securities sold under repurchase agreements 

table of contents other contractual obligations 
set forth below is information regarding our material contractual obligations as of december  operating lease obligations 
we lease certain facilities and equipment under various non cancelable operating leases 
future minimum non cancelable lease commitments were as follows at december  at december  in thousands thereafter total maturing time certificates of deposits 
set forth below is a maturity schedule  as of december   of time certificates of deposit of  or more at december  in thousands thereafter loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
in order to meet the financing needs of its customers in the normal course of business  we make commitments to extend credit and issue standby commercial letters of credit to or for our customers 
at december  and  we were committed to fund certain loans inclusive of mortgages held for sale amounting to approximately million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the customer may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit 
we expect  based on historical experience  that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
to varying degrees  commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customers to whom such commitments are made is equal to the amount of those commitments 
as a result  before making such a commitment to a customer  we evaluate the customer s creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we apply when deciding whether or not to approve loans to the customer 
in addition  we often require the customer to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  residential properties and properties under construction 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 

table of contents we believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources  together with available borrowings under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet any increases in demand for loans and leases or in the utilization of outstanding loan commitments or standby letters of credit and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future 
capital resources the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on a stand alone basis are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can lead to the imposition of certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary restrictions on the operations of the company and the bank by their respective bank regulatory agencies  that  if imposed  could have a direct material adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition
