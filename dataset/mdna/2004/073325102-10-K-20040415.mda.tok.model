item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary during fiscal  revenues increased from fiscal primarily due to a slight increase in technology spending  new product introductions  continued increases in our customer support revenues  as well as favorable foreign exchange rate impacts on our international operations 
revenue increased for both licenses and services consulting  education and customer support 
additionally  each geographical region americas  europe  middle east and africa emea  asia pacific  apac also reported revenue growth 
the benefit of prior years cost containment measures continued to be reflected during the year  resulting in increased net income from fiscal additionally  our international operations benefited from foreign currencies strengthening against the us dollar 
in fiscal  this impact resulted in increased revenues of million and increased expenses of million compared with international results translated at a constant exchange rate as of the beginning of fiscal we will continue to monitor trends in technology spending  as this is a leading macro economic indicator of future opportunity 
as discussed below in the results of operations section  we have seen an increasing trend of multi million dollar sale contracts since fiscal seasonality 
our first quarter sales are typically lower than sales in the immediately preceding fourth quarter because most of our customers begin a new fiscal year on january and it is common for capital expenditures to be lower in an organization s first quarter than in its fourth quarter 
in addition  because of our commission structure and other sales incentives  sales in the first quarter tend to be lower than the immediately preceding fourth quarter 
we anticipate that the negative impact of seasonality on our first quarter will continue

the reduction in total revenues from fiscal to fiscal was driven by decreases in sales of software licenses and consulting and education revenues  offset partially by an increase in customer support revenues

fiscal license fees the slight increase in license revenues from fiscal to fiscal was due in part to an increase in license revenues derived from product transactions of high dollar value transactions with a product value greater than million 
management believes that there is a current trend toward a greater portion of our license revenues being derived from product transactions of high dollar value 
the number of transactions with a license value greater than million increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal furthermore  we entered into one large transaction with a license value greater than million during fiscal there was no individual transaction with license value greater than million during fiscal the decrease in license revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to reductions in it spending on a worldwide basis and the general economic downturn 
many large enterprises initiated aggressive cost cutting measures  including reductions in it spending  during the latter half of fiscal and continuing through fiscal although general economic conditions and it spending have improved slightly during fiscal  customer spending continues to be cautious and it purchases are subject to rigorous internal review and approvals  resulting in some customers canceling or postponing it projects  postponing it purchases or placing smaller orders

customer support revenues consist of fees for annual maintenance contracts  which are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement generally one year 
customer support is typically priced as a percentage of license fees 
the significant increases in customer support revenues from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal were driven by maintenance renewals on our

consulting and education revenues decreased significantly from fiscal to fiscal as the economic slowdown and general reductions in it spending on a worldwide basis impacted our business 
consulting and education revenues increased from fiscal to fiscal due  in part  to an increase in demand for consulting and education services related to our new weblogic integration and weblogic platform products  which were released in july revenues by geographic region the following tables provide a summary of revenues by geographic region in thousands fiscal fiscal percentage of consolidated total revenues fiscal fiscal percentage of consolidated total revenues fiscal fiscal percentage of consolidated total revenues americas emea apac total revenues for each of the twelve fiscal quarters included in the three fiscal years ended january   emea and apac revenues as a percentage of total revenues have ranged between percent to percent for emea and percent to percent for apac 
these ranges may fluctuate in the future depending upon regional economic conditions  foreign currency exchange rates  and if a large sale is made in a particular region 
our revenues in apac have increased in absolute dollars over the three years period due primarily to our entry into the chinese market in the second quarter of fiscal our revenues in emea in fiscal were favorably impacted by the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar  particularly the euro and the british pound  which tends to increase our foreign currency denominated revenues when translated into us dollars 
in fiscal  the overall increase in revenues due to strengthening foreign currencies was million  of which million was recognized in emea 
management believes this impact was partially offset by large customers who can purchase licenses in any region  and therefore  demand higher discounts in regions where the us dollar is weakening 
this impact was also partially offset by a decrease in the third quarter of fiscal in local list prices of our software products  which are periodically adjusted  in part  due to changes in currency exchange rates

cost of license fees  as referenced in the table above  includes fees paid to third party contractors in connection with our customer license compliance program  royalties and license fees paid to third parties  costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media  the printing of user manuals  packaging and distribution costs and localization costs 
cost of licenses were percent  percent and percent of license revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the expansion of our compliance program during fiscal and associated payments made to third party contractors 
the increased activity in the compliance program has resulted in the detection of over deployments of our software and has resulted in additional license and support revenue opportunities 
cost of services 
cost of services  consists primarily of salaries and benefits for consulting  education  and product support personnel  cost of third party delivered education and consulting revenues  and infrastructure costs in information technology and real estate facilities for the operation of the services organization 
cost of services represented percent  percent and percent of services revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
cost of services as a percentage of services revenue has continued to decrease from fiscal to fiscal largely due a larger mix of higher margin support revenues versus lower margin consulting and education revenues 
amortization of certain acquired intangible assets included 
the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of purchased technology  non compete agreements  customer base  patents and trademarks and distribution rights 
the decrease in amortization from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to a portion of our acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to a portion of our acquired intangible assets being written off in fiscal  partially offset by the amortization of acquired intangible assets that arose from a number of small acquisitions in the latter half of fiscal and during fiscal amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded prior to january  is currently expected to total approximately million and million for the fiscal years ending january  and  respectively 
we amortize these amounts through our cost of revenue 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods

these expenses also include programs aimed at increasing revenues  such as advertising  public relations  trade shows and user conferences 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses from fiscal to fiscal was due to strengthening foreign currencies against the us dollar  as well as increased commissions paid to our sales force on our increased revenues 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to headcount reductions and other cost cutting initiatives implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which reflects a shift in resources and headcount from sales and marketing to research and development activities

all costs incurred in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products have been expensed as incurred 
the fiscal and fiscal year over year increases in research and development expenses were due to increases in product development personnel and expenses associated with the development and release of several new products and product versions  as well as the acquisition of several small development stage companies during fiscal and fiscal research and development as a percentage of total revenues increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal  which represents a shift in resources and headcount from sales and marketing to research and development activities 
in fiscal  research and development expenditures increased in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue was partially driven by cost containment measures implemented by the company 
we believe that a significant level of research and development is required to remain competitive and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to product development and engineering in future periods 
we occasionally enter into product development agreements with third parties that provide funding to us  which is intended by us and the third party to offset certain research and development costs incurred by us 
such amounts are recorded as a reduction in our operating expenses 
during fiscal  we received approximately million of third party funding  which was used to offset million of research and development expenses and million for marketing expenses 
the amount of such funding received by us in fiscal was million 
the amount of such funding received by bea in fiscal was insignificant

the increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal was due to the expansion of our infrastructure  including information systems 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal due to increased legal expenses on intellectual property matters as well as investments in our international operations 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill was million in fiscal commencing february   amortization of goodwill ceased in accordance with new accounting guidelines

the facilities consolidation charge also included the write off of million of leasehold improvements 
the estimated costs of abandoning these leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease  were based on market information and trend analyses  including information obtained from third party real estate industry sources 
as of january   million of lease termination costs  net of anticipated sublease income  remains accrued and is expected to be fully utilized by fiscal additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced the scope and re evaluated the timing of the planned construction of facilities at our san jose  california headquarters  resulting in an additional facilities related charge of million 
during fiscal  we reduced our workforce by approximately percent and  accordingly  we recorded total severance charges of million  of which million was paid in fiscal and million was paid in fiscal the employee reductions were across all business functions  operating units and major geographic regions

in addition  we recorded net gains of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  related to sales of certain other minority investments to unrelated third parties 
these gains were offset by write downs of equity investments of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  of which million in fiscal and million in fiscal were write downs of the remainder of our investment in webgain 
there were no write downs of equity investments during fiscal we have a net balance of equity investments in privately held technology companies of approximately million at january  as discussed in the change in accounting principle section on page of this annual report on form k  on august   we recorded the carrying value of leased land and the related debt that had previously been accounted for as an operating lease 
prior to august   the carrying costs associated with the san jose land of approximately million per quarter were accounted for as rent expense  which was recorded as operating expenses and cost of services 
subsequent to august   these carrying costs have been recorded as interest expense 
this change is the primary reason for the increase in interest expense from fiscal to fiscal provision for income taxes we have provided for income tax expense of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate was percent for both fiscal and fiscal excluding the impact of impairment charges of certain acquired intangible assets and goodwill  our effective income tax rate was percent for fiscal the decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal and fiscal relative to fiscal is due primarily to the effect of the cessation in the amortization of goodwill in accordance with new accounting guidelines 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal and fiscal differed from the us federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to the benefit of low taxed foreign earnings 
our fiscal effective income tax rate was higher than the us federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to non deductible goodwill amortization and goodwill impairment charges

accounting for income taxes fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
fas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the available evidence  which includes our historical levels of us taxable income and stock option deductions  we have provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to the extent that they are dependent upon future taxable income for realization 
we intend to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis

index to financial statements during fiscal  we implemented a strategy of holding investments with slightly longer maturities  which results in a greater portion of our cash resources being classified as short term investments 
this strategy resulted in net purchases in fiscal of million compared with net purchases in fiscal of million

we also used million less cash in fiscal than in fiscal for purchases of property and equipment and used million more cash for net payments for acquisitions and equity investments 
we also used million less cash in fiscal than in fiscal for purchases of property and equipment and million less cash for net payments for acquisitions and equity investments

during fiscal  we repaid million of long term debt related to the land lease  which resulted in million of long term restricted cash becoming unrestricted 
the net effect of this debt repayment was million of cash provided by financing activities which represents the excess of the restricted cash balance over the debt repayment 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal of million was primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of million and the increase of million in restricted cash for collateral on our san jose land lease transaction  offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock compensation plans

the long term debt related to the san jose land lease was recorded on our balance sheet when we adopted the provision of fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  on august  the adoption of fin on august  had no impact on our liquidity because the change in the accounting method for the synthetic lease arrangement did not change the underlying cash flows

index to financial statements in connection with the long term debt related to the san jose land lease  we must maintain certain covenants  including liquidity  leverage and profitability ratios 
as of january   we are in compliance with all such financial covenants 
as part of the san jose land lease agreement  we were required to maintain a minimum restricted cash balance consisting of united states government securities as defined in the lease  which was approximately million prior to the partial repayment of land lease debt of million that occurred on october  the requirement to maintain the restricted cash balance was removed when this partial repayment was made on october  when we begin to develop the land subject to the land lease  the development will require significant cash and or financing resources

our principal source of liquidity is our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations 
our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products  which are subject to rapid technological changes  or a reduction of capital expenditures by our customers as a result of a downturn in the global economy  among other factors 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through january  however  we may make acquisitions or license products and technologies complementary to our business or we may decide to purchase the land held under the san jose land lease  and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to the extent necessary to fund any such acquisitions  licenses  or purchase 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  at all  or on terms favorable to us

we offer our software licenses and services to our customers under software license and service agreements 
these agreements contain the relevant terms of the contractual arrangement with the customer  and may include provisions that indemnify the customer against expenses  and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the customer in the event our software is found to infringe upon a third party patent  copyright  trademark  or other proprietary rights

critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate these estimates  and believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our judgments and estimates revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  facilities consolidation charges  intangible assets and goodwill  and impairment of long lived assets 
we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
our management has reviewed our critical accounting policies  our critical accounting estimates  and the related disclosures with our audit committee of the board of directors 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further description of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow detailed guidelines discussed below and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments 
for software license sales that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software  we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii we have delivered the license products  iii the fee is considered to be fixed or determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment and iv collection is probable 
the majority of our license revenues are recognized in this manner 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
the fair value of the undelivered elements  whether consulting services  customer support or education  is determined based on our historical evidence of stand alone sales of these elements to customers 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the total revenue is deferred and recognized only when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value is established 
we do not record revenue on sales to customers whose ability to pay is in doubt at the time of sale 
rather  revenue is recognized from these customers as cash is collected 
the determination of a customer s ability to pay requires significant judgment  including an assessment of their financial condition  past payment history  business and industry outlook and other factors 
in addition  revenues in certain countries or regions where the collection risk is considered to be high  such as latin america and certain asia and east european countries are recognized only when full cash payment or an irrevocable letter of credit from a reputable financial institution is received from the customer 
the judgments that we make regarding collection risk for specific customers  countries or regions can materially impact the timing of recognition of revenues 
revenue arrangements with extended payment terms are generally considered not to be fixed or determinable and  accordingly  we do not generally recognize revenue on these arrangements until the customer payment becomes due 
the determination of whether extended payment terms are fixed or determinable requires significant judgment by management  including assessing such factors as the past payment history with the individual customer and evaluating the risk of concessions over an extended payment period 
the determinations that we make can materially impact the timing of recognition of revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at january  to date  our actual credit losses have been within our expectations 
income taxes 
realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future us taxable income 
fas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon available evidence  which includes our historical levels of us taxable income and stock option deductions  we have provided a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income at january  the resulting valuation allowance at january  is primarily attributable to accumulated stock option tax deduction benefits 
accordingly  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be credited to additional paid in capital when realized  rather than taken as a reduction of income tax expense 
facilities consolidation charges 
in fiscal  we recorded a facilities consolidation charge for our estimated future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
the estimates used in calculating the charge are reviewed on a quarterly basis and would be revised if estimated future vacancy rates and sublease rates vary from our original estimates 
to the extent that our new estimates vary adversely from our original estimates  we may incur additional losses that are not included in the accrued balance at january  conversely  unanticipated improvements in vacancy rates or sublease rates  or termination settlements for less than our accrued amounts  may result in a reversal of a portion of the accrued balance and a benefit on our statement of operations in a future period 
the maximum future cost associated with these excess facilities  assuming that no future sublease income is realized on these properties  other than for subleases that have been executed prior to january   and assuming that the landlords are unwilling to negotiate early 
table of contents 
index to financial statements lease termination arrangements  is estimated to be million  which exceeds the accrued balance at january  by million 
intangible assets and goodwill 
we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identified intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets such as purchased technology and noncompete agreements are amortized over time  while in process research and development is recorded as a one time charge on the acquisition date 
goodwill is not amortized but rather it is periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
further  when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets could occur 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our acquired intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually on november of each year and more frequently if events merit 
we perform this test in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
we have determined that we have only one reporting segment and one reporting unit 
accordingly  goodwill is tested for impairment in a two step process 
first  we determine if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  which may initially indicate that goodwill could be impaired 
if we determine that such impairment could have occurred  we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill as defined by fas to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
impairment of long lived assets 
we are required to test certain of our long lived assets for impairment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets fas  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of the assets may be permanently impaired 
the most significant long lived asset that must be tested for impairment under fas is our acre parcel of land in san jose  california the san jose land  which has a carrying value of million at january  in accordance with fas  if we determine that one or more impairment indicators are present  indicating that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  the carrying amount of the asset would be compared to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  the fair value would be compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the impairment loss would be the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the estimate of future cash flows that will be generated by us is highly subjective and requires significant management judgment 
in order to estimate future cash flows  we are required to make assumptions regarding future business conditions and operating results  which are inherently difficult to predict  particularly because the anticipated period of use for the san jose land extends relatively far into the future 
should different conditions prevail over this extended future period  a material write down of the san jose land of up to million could occur

change in accounting principle in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by a company if that company absorbs a majority of the vie s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual arrangement or other financial interest in the vie 
we adopted fin early on august   and as of that date  consolidated the entity the leasing entity from which we lease the acre parcel of land adjacent to our current corporate headquarters in san jose  california the san jose land  as we determined that the leasing entity is a vie  as defined by fin  and that we absorb a majority of the leasing entity s expected losses and receive a majority of its expected residual returns 
this lease is commonly referred to as a synthetic lease  which represents a form of financing under which an unrelated third party funds the costs of the acquisition of the asset and leases the asset to a lessee bea  and at least percent of the third party funds represent at risk equity 
in accordance with fin  we consolidated our interest in the leasing entity including the san jose land of million  on august  the san jose land is included in property and equipment  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at january  we intend to construct additional corporate offices and research and development facilities on the san jose land 
deferred financing fees of million were also recorded as of august   which represents the unamortized balance of deferred financing fees

deferred financing fees are included in other long term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at january  and will continue to be amortized over the remaining financing term 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reclassified million of previously capitalized development costs  primarily re zoning and architectural fees from current assets to the carrying value of the land 
on august   we also consolidated the leasing entity s debt of million long term debt related to the san jose land lease  of which percent or approximately million is legally structured as a non controlling interest 
this non controlling interest is in substance additional long term debt of ours due to the percent residual value guarantee on the property  the non recourse feature of the underlying debt  and certain other provisions of the lease arrangement  and  accordingly  the non controlling interest is recorded as long term debt  instead of minority interest  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at january  prior to the adoption of fin  we had expensed certain non cash interest costs associated with the san jose land lease arrangement during the period from november  to july  totaling million 
these costs are recorded as accrued liabilities related to the san jose land lease on our balance sheet 
on october   we repaid million of the long term debt related to the land lease  resulting in a remaining debt balance of million as of january   million of which is recorded in current liabilities as explained in the preceding paragraph and million of which is recorded as long term debt in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet 
prior to the adoption of fin  we had previously accounted for our involvement with the leasing entity as an operating lease and  accordingly  the san jose land and related debt obligation were not recorded on our balance sheet prior to august  there was no cumulative effect of the accounting change on august  because the san jose land is a non depreciable asset and the total carrying costs recorded by us in connection with the san jose land from the date the land was acquired in february through july  would have been the same under the fin accounting treatment

index to financial statements risk factors that may impact future operating results we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our common stock 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in our actual or anticipated quarterly revenues and operating results may prevent us from meeting securities analysts or investors expectations and may result in a decline in our stock price 
although we have experienced annual revenue growth in recent years  our revenues have historically fluctuated 
for example  in the quarters ended october   april  and april   our revenues declined as compared to the previous fiscal quarter  and in the quarters ended october   january   april  and july  our revenues declined as compared to the same quarterly periods in the prior fiscal year 
if our revenues  operating results  earnings or future projections are below the levels expected by investors or securities analysts  our stock price is likely to decline 
our stock price is also subject to the substantial volatility generally associated with internet  software and technology stocks and may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance  such as the substantial declines in the prices of many such stocks that began in march through  as well as market declines related to terrorist activities and military actions 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in our future revenues and operating results as a result of many factors  including difficulty predicting the size and timing of customer orders  particularly as we have become more reliant on larger transactions  the rate of customer acceptance of our recently introduced weblogic platform products  and any order delays caused by customer evaluations of these new products  on going difficult economic conditions  particularly within the technology industry  as well as economic uncertainties arising out of possible future terrorist activities  military and security actions in iraq and the middle east in general  and geopolitical instability in markets such as the korean peninsula and other parts of asia  all of which have increased the likelihood that customers will unexpectedly delay  cancel or reduce the size of orders  resulting in revenue shortfalls  changes in our competitors product offerings and pricing policies  and customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements from us or our competitors  changes in the mix of products and services that we sell or the channels through which they are distributed  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could have an adverse impact on our international revenue  particularly in the emea region if the euro were to weaken against the us dollar  any increased price sensitivity by our customers  particularly in the face of continuing difficult economic conditions and increased competition  introduction or enhancement of our products or our competitors products  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products  such as our weblogic platform products  on a timely basis and whether any such new products are accepted in the market  the performance of our international business  which accounts for a substantial part of our consolidated revenues  our ability to further control costs and expenses  particularly in the face of the on going current difficult economic conditions  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the degree of success  if any  of our strategy to further establish and expand our relationships with distributors  the lengthy sales cycle for our products  particularly with regard to weblogic platform sales which typically involve more comprehensive solutions that may require more detailed customer evaluations  the structure  timing and integration of acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  the terms and timing of financing activities  potential fluctuations in demand or prices of our products and services  technological changes in computer systems and environments  our ability to meet our customers service requirements  costs associated with acquisitions  including expenses charged for any impaired acquired intangible assets and goodwill  and loss of key personnel 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast because of the timing  size and composition of our customer orders 
an increasingly material portion of our revenues has been derived from large orders  as major customers deployed our products 
for example  in the quarters ended january   october  and july   there were  and product transactions each with a value of greater than million  respectively  including one product transaction with a value of greater than million during the quarter ended july  increases in the dollar size of some individual license transactions increases the risk of fluctuation in future quarterly results because the unexpected loss of a small number of larger orders can create a significant revenue shortfall 
if we cannot generate a sufficient number of large customer orders  turn a sufficient number of development orders into orders for large deployments or if customers delay or cancel such orders in a particular quarter  it may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and  more significantly on a percentage basis  our net income or loss in that quarter 
moreover  we typically receive and fulfill most of our orders within the quarter  and a substantial portion of our orders  particularly our larger transactions  are typically received in the last month of each fiscal quarter 
as a result  even though we may have positive business indicators about customer demand during a quarter  we may not learn of revenue shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter 
not only could this significantly adversely affect our revenues  such shortfalls would substantially adversely affect our earnings because they may occur after it is too late to adjust expenses for that quarter 
this is particularly relevant at this time because we have previously implemented significant cost cutting measures  thereby making incremental additional cost cutting more difficult to achieve 
the risk of delayed or cancelled orders is also particularly relevant with respect to our increased dependence on large customer orders  which are more likely to be cancelled  delayed or reduced and also have a greater financial impact on our operating results 
moreover  ongoing adverse economic conditions worldwide  particularly those related to the technology industry and the economic and political uncertainties arising out of the ongoing us military activity in iraq  recent and possible future terrorist activities  other potential military and security actions in the middle east  and instability in markets such as the korean peninsula and other parts of asia  have increased the likelihood that customers will unexpectedly delay  cancel or reduce orders  resulting in revenue shortfalls 
any revenue shortfall below our expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we do not effectively compete with new and existing competitors  our revenues and operating margins will decline 
the market for application server and integration software  and related software infrastructure products and services  is highly competitive 
our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various segments of this marketplace 
these competitors include ibm  which also offers operating system software and hardware as discussed below  and oracle  which can bundle its competing product with their database and other 
table of contents 
index to financial statements software offerings at a discounted price 
in addition  certain application vendors  enterprise application integration vendors and other companies are developing or offering application server  enterprise application integration and portal software products and related services that may compete with products that we offer 
further  software development tool vendors typically emphasize the broad versatility of their tool sets and  in some cases  offer complementary software that supports these tools and performs basic application server and integration functions 
these tool vendors offer products that may compete with some of the features of our own product offerings 
finally  internal development groups within prospective customers organizations may develop software and hardware systems that may substitute for those we offer 
a number of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we 
some of our competitors are also hardware vendors who bundle their own application server  integration software and tool products  or similar products  with their computer systems and database vendors that advocate client server networks driven by the database server 
ibm is the primary hardware vendor that we compete with which offers a line of application server  integration  and related software infrastructure solutions for their customers 
sun microsystems is another hardware vendor which offers a line of application server and related software infrastructure solutions 
ibm s sale of application server and integration functionality along with its proprietary hardware systems requires us to compete with ibm  particularly with regard to its installed customer base  where ibm has certain inherent advantages due to its much greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and the integration of its enterprise application server and integration functionality with its proprietary hardware and database systems 
these inherent advantages allow ibm to bundle  at a discounted price  application server and integration solutions with computer hardware  software and related service sales 
in addition  ibm global services  a division of ibm and a large provider of consulting and information technology services  can influence their service customers choice of software products in favor of ibm s 
due to these factors  if we do not sufficiently differentiate our products based on functionality  reliability  ease of development  interoperability with non ibm systems  performance  total cost of ownership and return on investment and establish our products as more effective solutions to customers technological and economic needs  our business  operating results  and financial condition will suffer 
in addition to its current products which include some application server functionality  microsoft has announced that it intends to include and enhance certain application server and integration functionalities in its 
net technologies 
microsoft s 
net technologies is a proprietary programming environment that competes with the java based environment of our products 
a widespread acceptance of microsoft s 
net technologies  particularly among the large and mid sized enterprises from which most of our revenues are generated  could curtail the use of java and therefore adversely impact the sales of our products 
the 
net technologies and the bundling of competing functionality in versions of windows can require us to compete in certain areas with microsoft  which has certain inherent advantages due to its much greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  its greater name recognition  very large developer community  its substantial installed base and the integration of its broad product line and features into a web services environment 
we need to differentiate our products from microsoft s based on scalability  functionality  interoperability with non microsoft platforms  performance  total cost of ownership  return on investment  ease of development and reliability  and need to establish our products as more effective solutions to customers technological and economic needs 
we may not be able to successfully or sufficiently differentiate our products from those offered by microsoft  and microsoft s continued efforts in the application server  integration and web services markets and their proposed 
net alternative to java could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of their current and prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
such competition could materially adversely affect our ability to sell additional software licenses and maintenance  consulting and support services on terms favorable to us 
further  competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements our products and related services  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
the seasonality of our sales typically adversely affects our revenues in our first fiscal quarter 
our first quarter sales are typically lower than sales in the immediately preceding fourth quarter because most of our customers begin a new fiscal year on january and it is common for capital expenditures to be lower in an organization s first quarter than in its fourth quarter 
our commission structure also tends to result in lower sales in the first quarter than the fourth quarter 
we anticipate that the negative impact of seasonality on our first quarter will continue 
our revenues are derived primarily from a single group of similar and related products and related services  and a decline in demand or prices for these products or services could substantially adversely affect our operating results 
we currently derive the majority of our license and service revenues from bea weblogic server  bea tuxedo and from related products and services 
we expect these products and services to continue to account for the majority of our revenues in the immediate future 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for bea weblogic server  bea tuxedo or related services  such as a continued or worsened general economic slowdown  future terrorist activities or military actions  any decline in overall market demand  competition  product performance or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
as we have increased our focus on using strategic partners to provide services related to the deployment and use of our software solutions  we previously experienced a slowdown in the growth of our services revenue  particularly revenue derived from our consulting services  and it is possible this trend could resume 
conversely if this trend were to reverse  as it did in the quarters ended october   october  and january   when we experienced an increase from the previous fiscal quarters in our consulting revenues  it may adversely affect our overall operating margins since our consulting revenue margins are lower than our license revenue margins as well as our other services revenue margins 
if our recently introduced weblogic platform products do not achieve significant market acceptance  or market acceptance is delayed  our revenues will be substantially adversely affected 
in july  we introduced our weblogic platform group of products  a major new product release which includes weblogic server  weblogic workshop  weblogic integration and weblogic portal we have invested substantial resources to develop and market our weblogic platform products  and anticipate that this will continue 
if our weblogic platform products do not achieve substantial market acceptance among new and existing customers  due to factors such as any technological problems  competition  market shifts or sales execution  it will have a material adverse affect on our revenues and other operating results 
moreover  because the weblogic platform products offer broader solutions and other improvements over our prior products  potential customers may take additional time to evaluate their purchases  which could  during a transition period  slow customer acceptance of our weblogic platform products 
the ongoing us military activity in iraq and any terrorist activities could adversely affect our revenues and operations 
the us military activity in iraq  terrorist activities and related military and security operations have in the past disrupted economic activity throughout the united states and much of the world 
this significantly adversely impacted our operations and our ability to generate revenues in the past and may also again in the future 
an unfavorable course of events in the future related to the ongoing us military activity in iraq  any other military or security operations  particularly with regard to the middle east  any future terrorist activities  or the geopolitical tension on the korean peninsula could have a similar or worse effect on our operating results  
table of contents 
index to financial statements particularly if such attacks or operations occur in the last month or weeks of our fiscal quarter or are significant enough to further weaken the us or global economy 
in particular  such activities and operations could result in reductions in information technology spending  order deferrals  and reductions or cancellations of customer orders for our products and services 
if our weblogic workshop initiative does not successfully broaden the base of developers who utilize our weblogic platform products and drive other weblogic platform product sales  our revenues and product margins will be harmed 
our weblogic workshop tools product and related developer initiatives are designed to help broaden the base of developers who can utilize our technologies and products 
if weblogic workshop and these related initiatives are not successful  or less successful than we anticipate  it will have an adverse impact on our sales of bea weblogic products  including weblogic platform  the principal driver of our revenue  and related products and services  as well as adversely affect our profit margins 
if we are required to remit significant payroll taxes  it will have an adverse impact on our future financial results 
when our employees exercise certain stock options  we are subject to employer payroll taxes on the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
these payroll taxes are determined by the tax rates in effect in the employee s taxing jurisdiction and are treated as an expense in the period in which the exercise occurs 
during a particular period  these payroll taxes could be material  in particular if an increase in our stock price causes a significant number of employees to exercise their options 
however  because we are unable to predict our stock price  the number of exercises  or the country of exercise during any particular period  we cannot predict the amount  if any  of employer payroll tax expense that will be recorded in a future period or the impact on our future financial results 
over the last several quarters  our stock price has increased and a significant number of stock options with exercise prices below the trading range of our stock during the quarter ended january  have vested and become exercisable 
accordingly  there is increased likelihood that option holders will exercise their options in future periods and we will incur higher payroll taxes  particularly if our current stock price remains at the same level or rises 
changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to revenue recognition  could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue and profits 
although we use standardized license agreements designed to meet current revenue recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles  we must often negotiate and revise terms and conditions of these standardized agreements  particularly in larger license transactions 
negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and  in certain situations  may require us to defer recognition of revenue on the license 
while we believe that we are in compliance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  the american institute of certified public accountants continues to issue implementation guidelines for these standards and the accounting profession continues to discuss a wide range of potential interpretations 
additional implementation guidelines  and changes in interpretations of such guidelines  could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices that could cause us to defer the recognition of revenue to future periods or to recognize lower revenue and profits 
moreover  policies  guidelines and interpretations related to revenue recognition  accounting for acquisitions  our synthetic lease for the san jose land  income taxes  facilities consolidation charges  allowances for doubtful accounts and other financial reporting matters require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
to the extent that management s judgment is incorrect  it could result in an adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
some of these matters are also among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standard setters and regulators 
these standard setters and regulators could promulgate interpretations and guidance that could result in material and potentially adverse changes to our accounting policies 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  there has been an ongoing public debate whether employee stock option and employee stock purchase plan shares should be measured at their fair value and treated as a compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
if we were to elect or were required to record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method  we could have significant compensation charges 
for example  for the fiscal years ended january   and  had we accounted for stock based compensation plans under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 as amended by fasb statement no 
 diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by and per share  respectively 
although we are currently not required to record any compensation expense using the fair value method in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan  it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all stock based compensation as a compensation expense using the fair value method 
see note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
any failure to maintain on going sales through distribution channels could result in lower revenues 
to date  we have sold our products principally through our direct sales force  as well as through indirect sales channels  such as computer hardware companies  packaged application software developers  independent software vendors isvs  systems integrators sis and independent consultants  independent software tool vendors and distributors 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in maintaining existing relationships and further establishing and expanding relationships with distributors  isvs  original equipment manufacturers oems and sis 
in particular  we have an on going initiative to further establish and expand relationships with our distributors through these sales channels  especially isvs and sis 
a significant part of this initiative is to recruit and train a large number of consultants employed by sis and induce these sis to more broadly use our products in their consulting practices  as well as to embed our technology in products that our isv customers offer 
we intend to continue this initiative and to seek distribution arrangements with additional isvs to embed our weblogic server and other products in their products 
it is possible that we will not be able to successfully expand our distribution channels  secure agreements with additional sis and isvs on commercially reasonable terms or at all  and otherwise adequately continue to develop and maintain our relationships with indirect sales channels 
moreover  even if we succeed in these endeavors  it still may not increase our revenues 
in particular  we need to carefully monitor the development and scope of our indirect sales channels and create appropriate pricing  sales force compensation and other distribution parameters to help ensure these indirect channels do not conflict with or curtail our direct sales 
if we invest resources in these types of expansion and our overall revenues do not correspondingly increase  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we already rely on formal and informal relationships with a number of consulting and systems integration firms to enhance our sales  support  service and marketing efforts  particularly with respect to implementation and support of our products as well as lead generation and assistance in the sales process 
we will need to expand our relationships with third parties in order to support license revenue growth 
many such firms have similar  and often more established  relationships with our principal competitors 
it is possible that these and other third parties will not provide the level and quality of service required to meet the needs of our customers  or that we will not be able to maintain an effective  long term relationship with these third parties 
our international operations expose us to greater management  collections  currency  export licensing  intellectual property  tax  regulatory and other risks 
revenues from markets outside of the americas accounted  and for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
we sell our products and services through a network of branches and subsidiaries located in countries worldwide 
in addition  we also market our products through distributors 
we believe that our success depends upon continued expansion of our international operations 
our international business is subject to a number of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs  greater difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulties in maintaining and enforcing us accounting and public reporting standards  longer collection cycles  seasonality  potential changes in export 
table of contents 
index to financial statements licensing and tax laws  and greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property rights 
also  the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business can significantly impact our revenues 
for example  a strengthening of the us dollar could have an adverse impact on our international revenue  particularly in the emea region if the relative value of the euro were to decline 
also  we are periodically subject to tax audits by government agencies in foreign jurisdictions 
to date  the outcomes of these audits have not had a material impact on us 
it is possible  however  that future audits could result in significant assessments against us or our employees for transfer taxes  payroll taxes  income taxes  or other taxes as well as related employee and other claims which could adversely effect our operating results 
general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets  including the military action in the middle east and geopolitical instabilities on the korean peninsula and other parts of asia may also impact our international revenues  as such conditions may cause decreases in demand or impact our ability to collect payment from our customers 
there can be no assurances that these factors and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international revenues and consequently on our business and consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including developments in the internet  changes in the software or technology industry  general market and economic conditions  further terrorist activities  military actions in iraq and the middle east in general  geopolitical instability on the korean peninsula and other parts of asia  and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or our competitors operating performance 
in addition  bea and many other companies in the internet  technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations in their stock prices  including recent rapid rises and declines that often have not been directly related to the operating performance of such companies  such as the declines in the stock prices of many such companies that started in march such factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
because the technological  market and industry conditions in our business can change very rapidly  if we do not successfully adapt our products to these changes our revenue and profits will be harmed 
the market for our products and services is highly fragmented  competitive with alternative computing architectures  and characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving and competing industry standards  and changing customer requirements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies  the emergence of new industry standards  or changes in customer requirements could result in a decline in the markets for our existing products or render them obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  our success depends upon our ability to timely and effectively enhance existing products such as our weblogic server products and web services features  respond to changing customer requirements  and develop and introduce in a timely manner new products such as our weblogic platform  weblogic integration  weblogic workshop  weblogic liquid data and weblogic portal products that keep pace with technological and market developments and emerging industry standards 
in addition  the widespread continued adoption of java technologies and standards is critical to driving sales of our products because they operate in a java based environment 
the widespread acceptance of microsoft s 
net technologies  which competes with java based environments and technologies  could curtail the use of java 
a decline in the ability or willingness of sun microsystems  inc  the creator and licensor of a substantial portion of the basic technologies and standards comprising java  to devote resources to promote and facilitate the adoption and further development of java technologies and standards  as well as to make these java technologies and standards available on sufficiently favorable terms  could also curtail the use of java by the software industry  including us 
if the rate of adoption of java technologies and standards were to slow or decline  and we were unable to successfully adapt our products to other technologies and standards  it would adversely affect the sales of our products and services 
it is possible that our products will not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace and that we will not be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to our existing products or products incorporating new 
table of contents 
index to financial statements technology on a timely basis 
failure to develop and introduce new products  or enhancements to existing products  in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  or lack of customer acceptance of our products  will materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our success is increasingly dependent on our strategic partners ability to successfully develop and integrate their software with the bea products with which it interoperates or is bundled  integrated or marketed 
if their software performs poorly  contains errors or defects or is otherwise unreliable  or does not provide the features and benefits expected or required  it could lower the demand for our solutions and our products and services  result in negative publicity or loss of our reputation  and adversely affect our revenues and other operating results 
third parties could assert that our software products and services infringe their intellectual property rights  which could expose us to increased costs and litigation 
we are periodically subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
it is possible that third parties  including competitors  technology partners  and other technology companies  could successfully claim that our current or future products  whether developed internally or acquired  infringe their rights  including their trade secret  copyright and patent rights 
these types of claims  with or without merit  can cause costly litigation that absorbs significant management time  as well as impede our sales efforts due to any uncertainty as to the outcome  all of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
these types of claims could also cause us to pay substantial damages or settlement amounts  cease offering of any subject technology or products altogether  require us to enter into royalty or license agreements  compel us to license software under unfavorable terms  and damage our ability to sell products due to any uncertainty generated as to intellectual property ownership 
if required  we may not be able to obtain such royalty or license agreements  or obtain them on terms acceptable to us  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition  particularly if we are unable to ship key products 
we could report a net loss again 
we first reported significant net income under generally accepted accounting principles for the quarter ended july  however  despite this  we subsequently reported a net loss for the quarter ended october  this was due in part to the asset impairment charges of million related to prior acquisitions 
we also implemented a planned consolidation of various facilities and a planned reduction in work force of approximately percent in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year ended january  and took charges of million and million  respectively  related to these actions 
because of such factors as our limited operating history and on going expenses associated with our prior acquisitions  the possibility of future impairment charges and the possibility of future charges related to any future facilities consolidation or work force reductions  we may again experience net losses in future periods 
if the markets for application servers  application integration and related application infrastructure software and web services do not grow as quickly as we expect  our revenues will be harmed 
we sell our products and services in the application server  application integration and related application infrastructure markets 
these markets are evolving and are characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
our success is dependent in large part on acceptance of our products by large customers with substantial legacy mainframe systems  customers establishing or building out their presence on the web for commerce  and developers of web based commerce applications 
our future financial performance will depend in large part on the continued growth in the use of the web to run software applications and continued growth in the number of companies extending their mainframe based  mission critical applications to an enterprise wide distributed computing environment and to the internet through the use of application server and integration technology 
the markets for application server  application platform  and integration technology and related services may not grow and could decline 

table of contents 
index to financial statements even if they do grow  they may grow more slowly than we anticipate  particularly in view of the recent economic downturn affecting the technology sector in the united states  asia and europe 
if these markets fail to grow  grow more slowly than we currently anticipate  or decline  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
if we cannot successfully integrate our past and future acquisitions  our revenues may decline and expenses may increase 
from our inception in january  we have made a substantial number of strategic acquisitions 
in connection with acquisitions completed prior to january   we recorded approximately million as intangible assets and goodwill of which approximately million has been amortized or written off as of january  in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling million against certain acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
if future events cause additional impairment of any intangible assets acquired in our past or future acquisitions  we may have to record additional charges relating to such assets sooner than we expect which would cause our profits to decline 
in addition  integration of acquired companies  divisions and products involves the assimilation of potentially conflicting operations and products  which diverts the attention of our management team and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results in future quarters 
it is possible that we may not achieve any of the intended financial or strategic benefits of these transactions 
while we intend to make additional acquisitions in the future  there may not be suitable companies  divisions or products available for acquisition 
our acquisitions entail numerous risks  including the risk that we will not successfully assimilate the acquired operations and products  retain key employees of the acquired operations  or execute successfully the product development strategy driving the acquisition 
there are also risks relating to the diversion of our management s attention  and difficulties and uncertainties in our ability to maintain the key business relationships that we or the acquired entities have established 
in addition  we may have product liability or intellectual property liability associated with the sale of the acquired company s products 
acquisitions also expose us to the risk of claims by terminated employees  from shareholders of the acquired companies or other third parties related to the transaction 
finally  if we undertake future acquisitions  we may issue dilutive securities  assume or incur additional debt obligations  incur large one time expenses  utilize substantial portions of our cash  and acquire intangible assets that would result in significant future amortization expense 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
on june   the fasb eliminated pooling of interests accounting for acquisitions 
the effect of this change could be to increase the portion of the purchase price for any future acquisitions that must be charged to our cost of revenues and operating expenses in the periods following any such acquisitions 
as a consequence  our results of operations in periods following any such acquisition could be materially adversely affected 
although these changes will not directly affect the purchase price for any of these acquisitions  they will have the effect of increasing the reported expenses associated with any of these acquisitions 
to that extent  these changes may make it more difficult for us to acquire other companies  product lines or technologies 
also on june   the fasb pronounced under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas that purchased goodwill should not be amortized  but rather  should be periodically reviewed for impairment 
such impairment could be caused by internal factors as well as external factors beyond our control 
the fasb has further determined that at the time goodwill is considered impaired  an amount equal to the impairment loss should be charged as an operating expense in the statement of operations 
the timing of such an impairment if any of goodwill acquired in past and future transactions is uncertain and difficult to predict 
our results of operations in periods following any such impairment could be materially adversely affected 
we are required to determine whether goodwill and any assets acquired in past acquisitions have been impaired in accordance with fas and  if so  charge such impairment as an expense 
in the quarter ended october   we took an asset impairment charge of million related to past acquisitions 
we have remaining net goodwill and net acquired intangible assets of approximately million at january   so if we are required to take such additional impairment charges  the amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the lengthy sales cycle for our products makes our revenues susceptible to substantial fluctuations 
our customers typically use our products to implement large  sophisticated applications that are critical to their business  and their purchases are often part of their implementation of a distributed or web based computing environment 
customers evaluating our software products face complex decisions regarding alternative approaches to the integration of enterprise applications  competitive product offerings  rapidly changing software technologies and standards and limited internal resources due to other information systems requirements 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle for our products is lengthy and is subject to delays or cancellation over which we have little or no control 
we have recently experienced an increase in the number of million and multi million dollar license transactions 
for example  in the quarters ended january   october  and july   we had  and product transactions each with a value at greater than million  respectively  including one product transaction with a value of over million in the quarter ended july  in some cases  this has resulted in more extended customer evaluation and procurement processes  which in turn have lengthened the overall sales cycle for our products 
the recent economic downturn in our key markets has also contributed to increasing the length of our sales cycle  and there is a risk that this could continue or worsen 
finally  the recent introduction of the weblogic platform may contribute to a longer sales cycle due to the fact that it offers a more comprehensive solution that may require more detailed customer evaluations 
delays or failures to complete large orders and sales in a particular quarter could significantly reduce revenue that quarter  as well as subsequent quarters over which revenue for the sale would likely be recognized 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may use our technology and trademarks  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenues and increase our costs 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
it is possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patents may not provide a competitive advantage to us 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
in particular  we have  in the past  provided certain hardware oems with access to our source code  and any unauthorized publication or proliferation of our source code could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
it is difficult for us to police unauthorized use of our products  and although we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy is a persistent problem 
effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the protection of our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products  or design around patents and other intellectual property rights that we hold 
if we are unable to manage growth  our business will suffer 
we have experienced substantial growth since our inception in that has placed a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure 
overall  we have increased the number of our employees from employees in three offices in the united states at january  to approximately  employees in offices in countries at january  our ability to manage our staff and growth effectively requires us to continue to improve our operational  financial  disclosure and management controls  reporting systems and procedures  and information technology infrastructure  particularly in light of the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations 
in this regard  we are continuing to update our management information systems to integrate financial and other reporting among our multiple domestic and foreign offices 
in addition  we may continue to increase our staff worldwide and continue to improve the financial reporting and controls for our global operations 
we are also continuing to develop and roll out information technology 
table of contents 
index to financial statements initiatives 
it is possible that we will not be able to successfully implement improvements to our management information  control systems  reporting systems and information technology infrastructure in an efficient or timely manner and that  during the course of this implementation  we could discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls  as well as past errors resulting therefrom 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
we could incur substantial charges to our consolidated statement of operations if we alter our plan to construct additional corporate offices and research and development facilities on the leased acre parcel of land in san jose  california that is recorded in our balance sheet 
we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin on august   and consolidated the entity the leasing entity from which we lease the acre parcel of land adjacent to our current corporate headquarters in san jose  california the san jose land as of that date 
accordingly  we consolidated the san jose land  which had a carrying value of million on august  as well as the related debt obligation of million 
we had previously accounted for our involvement with the leasing entity as an operating lease and  accordingly  the land and related debt obligation were not recorded on our balance sheet prior to august  see note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on this change in accounting principle 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reclassified million of previously capitalized development costs  primarily re zoning and architectural fees from current assets to the carrying value of the land 
we currently intend to construct additional corporate offices and research and development facilities on the san jose land 
accordingly  the land is treated as a held and used asset 
if we were to decide not to proceed with the construction of these facilities  if we significantly delayed or scaled back the construction project or if we decide to sell the san jose land  the land may then meet the criteria to be treated as a held for sale asset and  if the land s fair market value at that time was less than the carrying value of million  we would have to write down the carrying value of the san jose land  which could result in substantial charges to our consolidated statement of operations of up to the carrying value of million 
we will assess the san jose land for impairment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets fas  at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of the san jose land may be permanently impaired 
in accordance with fas  if we determine that one or more impairment indicators are present  indicating the carrying amount may not be recoverable  the carrying amount of the asset would be compared to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset  or the relevant asset grouping  is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  the fair value would be compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the impairment loss would be the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
to date  no impairment losses on the land have been recorded under fas  however there can be no assurance that we will not be required to record a substantial impairment charge related to the san jose land of up to million if events or circumstances change and we determine that the value of the san jose land is impaired under fas we have a high debt balance and large interest obligations  which constrict our liquidity and could result in substantial future expenses and substantial cash outflows 
at january   we had approximately million of convertible notes outstanding and debt related to the san jose land lease of million 
as a result of this indebtedness  we have substantial principal and interest payment obligations 
the degree to which we are leveraged could significantly harm our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on the convertible notes  the long term debt related to the san jose land lease  and other indebtedness  future capital expenditures  payments on our operating leases and any increased working capital requirements 
to the extent our stock price does not exceed per share by december  or does not exceed per share between december and december  for a requisite number of trading days to permit us to effectively force the conversion of the notes  we will be required to pay million to repay the convertible notes in december if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of cash flow from operations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  to make future acquisitions  to absorb adverse operating results or to fund capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements would be significantly reduced 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay the convertible notes and the long term debt related to the san jose land lease at maturity  we could attempt to refinance these debt obligations  however  no assurance can be given that such a refinancing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
any failure by us to satisfy our obligations with respect to these debt obligations at maturity with respect to payments of principal or prior thereto with respect to payments of interest or required repurchases would constitute a default 
if we lose key personnel or cannot hire enough qualified personnel  it will adversely affect our ability to manage our business  develop new products and increase revenue 
we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  including our chairman  chief executive officer and president  alfred s 
chuang  and other key members of management 
competition for these types of employees is intense  and it is possible that we will not be able to retain our key employees and that we will not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining qualified candidates in the future 
as we seek to expand our global organization  the hiring of qualified sales  technical and support personnel will be difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
failure to attract  assimilate and retain key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our products contain software defects  it could harm our revenues and expose us to litigation 
the software products we offer are internally complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects  especially when we first introduce them 
we may need to issue corrective releases of our software products to fix any defects or errors 
any defects or errors could also cause damage to our reputation and result in loss of revenues  product returns or order cancellations  or lack of market acceptance of our products 
accordingly  any defects or errors could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
these risks are all particularly acute with regard to major new product releases  such as weblogic platform  which was introduced in july our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims  which could be substantial in light of our customers use of such products in mission critical applications 
if a claimant brings a product liability claim against us  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products interoperate with many parts of complicated computer systems  such as mainframes  servers  personal computers  application software  databases  operating systems and data transformation software 
failure of any one of these parts could cause all or large parts of computer systems to fail 
in such circumstances  it may be difficult to determine which part failed  and it is likely that customers will bring a lawsuit against several suppliers 
even if our software is not at fault  we could suffer material expense and material diversion of management time in defending any such lawsuits 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we have adopted a preferred stock rights plan which has anti takeover effects 
we have implemented a preferred stock rights plan 
the plan has the anti takeover effect of causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the existence of the plan could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable

international revenues from each individual country outside of the united states were less than percent of total revenues in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal with the exception of united kingdom with million or percent of the total revenues in fiscal international sales were made mostly from our foreign sales subsidiaries in the local countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  export license restrictions  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
effective february   we adopted the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we use derivative instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency 
our objectives in holding derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts between our parent company in the united states and our foreign subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and may adversely impact overall financial results 
we have a program to reduce the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses from recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
this program involves the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in certain european  asian and latin and north american currencies 
a forward foreign exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
under this program  foreign currency gains and losses due to exchange rate fluctuations are partially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market on a monthly basis with gains and losses included in interest

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities fas 
all of the cash equivalents  short term investments and short term and long term restricted cash are treated as available for sale under fas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  we reduce our interest rate risk by investing our cash in instruments with remaining time to maturity of less than two years 
as of january   the average holding period until maturity of our cash equivalents  short and long term restricted cash and short term investments was approximately days

the effective annual interest rate on this debt was approximately percent as of january  the annual interest expense on this debt will fluctuate from time to time depending on changes in libor and changes in our financial position as specified in the lease agreement 
a percent basis point increase in libor will generate an increase in annual interest expense of approximately million 
we are also exposed to changes in short term interest rates through our invested balances of cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments  the yields on which will fluctuate with changes in short term interest rates 
a percent basis point decrease in short term interest rates would result in an annual reduction of interest income of approximately million 
the annual interest rate on our million convertible notes is fixed at percent through the maturity date in december
