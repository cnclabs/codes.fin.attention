item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations universal has developed a broad line of easy to use  pre programmed universal wireless control products that are marketed principally for home video and audio entertainment equipment through various channels of distribution  including international retail  private label  oems  and cable and satellite service providers and to companies in the computing industry 
universal believes that its universal wireless controls can operate virtually all infrared remote ir controlled tvs  vcrs  dvd players  cable converters  cd players  audio components and satellite receivers  as well as most other infrared remote controlled devices worldwide 
beginning in and continuing today  universal has compiled an extensive library of over  ir codes that cover nearly  individual device functions and over  individual consumer electronic equipment brand names 
universal s library is regularly updated with new ir codes used in newly introduced video and audio devices 
all such ir codes are captured from the original manufacturer s remote control devices to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the database 
universal s proprietary software and know how permit ir codes to be compressed before being loaded into its products 
this provides significant cost and space efficiencies that enable universal to include more codes and features in the memory space of the wireless control device than are included in similarly priced products of competitors 
universal has developed a patented technology that provides the capability to easily upgrade the memory of the wireless control device by adding ir codes from its library that were not originally included 
the matters discussed in this annual report on form k should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
certain statements contained herein may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  as discussed more fully herein 
see  factors that may affect financial condition and future results in this form k 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements are the following the failure of our markets to continue growing and expanding in the manner we anticipate  the failure of our customers to grow and expand as we anticipate  the effects of natural or other events beyond our control  including the effect a war or terrorist activities may have on the company or the economy  the economic environment s effect on us and our customers  the growth of  acceptance of and the demand for our products and technologies in various markets and geographical regions  including cable  satellite  consumer electronics  retail and interactive tv and home automation  not materializing as we believe  our inability to add profitable complementary products which are accepted by the marketplace  our inability to continue to maintain our operating costs at acceptable levels through our cost containment efforts  our realization of tax benefits from various tax projects initiated from time to time  the continued strength of our balance sheet  our inability to continue selling our products or licensing our technologies at higher or profitable margins throughout and beyond  the failure of the various markets and industries to grow or emerge as rapidly or as successfully as we believed  the continued growth of the digital market  our inability to obtain orders or maintain our order volume with new and existing customers  the possible dilutive effect our stock option program may have on our earnings per share and stock price  our inability to continue to obtain adequate quantities of component parts or secure adequate factory production capacity on a timely basis  and other factors listed from time to time in our press releases and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  more information about risk factors that could affect our business and financial results is included in the section entitled factors that may affect financial condition and future results in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates 
table of contents and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  inventories  valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on the sale of products when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is pervasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for the majority of our sales  recognition occurs when products are shipped 
we also license our intellectual property including our patented technologies trade secrets  trademarks  and database of infrared codes 
we record license revenue when our customers ship products incorporating our intellectual property  provided collection of such revenue is reasonably assured 
in addition  we generate service revenues as a result of providing consumer support programs  through our call centers  to some of our customers 
these service revenues are recognized when earned 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly estimate returns and sales allowances  revenue could be misstated 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivables and historical bad debts  customer credit  current economic trends and changes in customer payment trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventories consist of wireless control devices  including universal remote controls  wireless keyboards  antennas  and related component parts including integrated circuits and are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a significant variance between our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  and based on the carrying value of the asset being less than the undiscounted cash flows  we measure an impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in assessing the recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortization on approximately million of net unamortized goodwill beginning january  we recorded approximately  of amortization during and would have recorded approximately  of amortization during both and we performed an initial impairment review of our goodwill on january   conducted annual impairment reviews as of 
table of contents december  and and will perform an annual review in subsequent years 
in performing the initial impairment review  we identified our reporting units and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units as of january  we then determined the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows and compared it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
based on this analysis  we determined that each reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying amount  and therefore concluded that there was no indication of a transitional impairment loss 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing expenses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we must provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for tax liabilities involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
in situations involving tax related uncertainties  we provide for deferred tax liabilities when we believe such liabilities are reasonably expected to occur 
actual results could differ from our estimates

historically  our working capital needs have typically been greatest during the third and fourth quarters when accounts receivable and inventories increase in connection with the fourth quarter holiday selling season 
at december   we had million of working capital as compared to at december  the increase in working capital during these periods is principally due to increases in cash
