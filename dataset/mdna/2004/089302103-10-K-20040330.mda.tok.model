table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due under the company s contractual obligations at january  payments due by period less than more than year to years to years years total in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations the disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that the company believes to be reasonable as of the date of this report 
those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate  consequently  the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that the company ultimately incurs 
variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from those actually incurred include  but are not limited to the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration  fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation  the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by the company as of the date of this report  fluctuations in third party fees  governmental charges or market rates that the company is obligated to pay under contracts it has with certain vendors  and the exercise of renewal options under or the automatic renewal of contracts that provide for the same 
long term debt obligations are limited to the senior notes 
the table assumes that the senior notes are paid at maturity see long term obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
operating lease obligations include  among other items  leases for the company s retail stores  warehouse space  and offices 
many of the store lease obligations require the company to pay for common area maintenance  real estate taxes  and insurance 
the company has made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for its contractual obligations relative to common area maintenance  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
the company estimates that future obligations for common area maintenance  real estate taxes  and property insurance are million at january  those assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to extrapolation of historical data to estimate the company s future obligations  calculation of the company s obligations based on per square foot averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold  and assumptions related to certain increases over historical data where the company s obligation is a prorated share of all lessees obligations within a particular property see leases in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
for purposes of the operating lease and purchase obligation disclosures  the company has assumed that it will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date  and the company disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended  whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement of the company and its vendor  due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension 
where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term  the company disclosed its minimum commitment under such obligation  eg one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term  due to the uncertainty of the length of the eventual term

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
the company s accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america are also described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the items listed below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the principles application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
the company has certain critical accounting policies and accounting estimates  which are described below 
merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics  and is stated at its current retail selling value 
inventory retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates  such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation and gross profit 
these assumptions are based on historical experience and current information 
factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise  and seasonal trends 
when a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise or a promotional markdown decision is made  the resulting gross profit reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the fiscal year 
such estimates are based on experience and the most recent physical inventory results 
while it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage  the company has loss prevention programs and policies that it believes will minimize shrinkage 
due to the nature of the company s purchasing practices for closeout and deeply discounted merchandise  vendors and merchandise suppliers generally do not offer the company incentives such as slotting fees  cooperative advertising allowances  buy down agreements  or other forms of rebates that would materially reduce its cost of sales 
property and equipment 
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
service lives are principally forty years for buildings and from three to fifteen years for other property and equipment 

table of contents impairment 
the company has long lived assets that consist primarily of property and equipment 
the company estimates useful lives on buildings and equipment using assumptions based on historical data and industry trends 
impairment is recorded if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows 
the company s assumptions related to estimates of future cash flows are based on historical results of cash flows adjusted for management projections for future periods taking into account known conditions and planned future activities 
the company s assumptions regarding the fair value of its long lived assets are based on the discounted future cash flows 
insurance reserves 
the company is self insured for certain losses relating to general liability  workers compensation  and employee medical benefit claims  and the company has purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit significant exposure in these areas 
accrued insurance liabilities are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
such amounts are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account known trends and projections of future results 
actual claims experience can impact these calculations and  to the extent that subsequent claim costs vary from estimates  future earnings could be impacted and the impact could be material 
income taxes 
the company records income tax loss contingencies for estimates of the outcome or settlement of various asserted and unasserted income tax contingencies including tax audits and administrative appeals 
at any one point in time  many tax years may be in various stages of audit or appeals or could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
this requires a periodic identification and evaluation of significant doubtful or controversial issues both individually and collectively 
the results of the audits  appeals  or expiration of the statute of limitations are reflected in the income tax contingency calculations accordingly 
the company has generated deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company has established a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
the effective income tax rate in any period may be materially impacted by the overall level of income loss  the jurisdictional mix and magnitude of income loss  changes in the expected outcome or settlement of an income tax contingency  changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance  and adjustments of a deferred tax liability or asset for enacted changes in tax laws or rates 
pension liabilities 
pension and other retirement benefits  including all relevant assumptions required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  are evaluated each year 
due to the technical nature of retirement accounting  outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated future obligations 
since there are many assumptions used to estimate future retirement benefits  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to pension expense and obligations 
certain actuarial assumptions  such as the discount rate and expected long term rate of return  have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic pension cost and the related benefit obligations 
the company reviews external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return 
the company s objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date 
in making this estimate  the company reviews rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
this process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of aa or better 
the discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for fiscal year was 
a increase in the discount rate would reduce the net periodic pension cost by million 
a reduction in the discount rate would increase the net periodic pension cost by million 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets  the company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the current or anticipated future allocation of the pension portfolio 
this resulted in the selection of the long term rate of return on assets for fiscal year a increase in the expected long term rate of return would decrease the net periodic pension cost by million 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return would increase the net periodic pension cost by million 
the company has reduced the expected long term rate of return on assets to for fiscal year 
table of contents legal obligations 
in the normal course of business  the company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which require the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process  however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be materially different from management s estimates and adjustments to income could be required 
the assumptions that are used by management are based on the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the company will record a liability related to legal obligations when it has determined that it is probable that the company will be obligated to pay and the related amount can be reasonably estimated  and it will disclose the related facts in the footnotes to its financial statements  if material 
if the company determines that either an obligation is probable or reasonably possible  the company will  if material  disclose the nature of the loss contingency and the estimated range of possible loss  or include a statement that no estimate of loss can be made 
the company makes these determinations in consultation with its outside legal advisors 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise including related inbound freight  markdowns  and inventory shrinkage  net of cash discounts and rebates 
the company classifies purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs  warehousing costs  internal transfer costs  and other distribution network costs as selling and administrative expenses 
due to this classification  the company s gross profit rates may not be comparable to those of other retailers that include costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales 
selling and administrative expenses 
the company includes store expenses such as payroll and occupancy costs  distribution and transportation costs  advertising  buying  depreciation  insurance  and overhead costs in selling and administrative expenses 
discontinued operations 
at january   the reserve for discontinued operations includes management s best estimate of the company s potential liability under its guarantee of store leases which have been rejected by kb as part of its bankruptcy proceeding 
management has utilized an independent real estate valuation firm to assist in developing this estimate 
management will periodically update its estimate as information about the potential liability becomes available 
if kb rejects additional leases as its bankruptcy proceeds  management will estimate the additional potential liability and record any charge as discontinued operations 
in addition  the kb stock purchase agreement contains mutual indemnifications of kb by the company and of the company by kb 
management s best estimate of any potential liability resulting from such mutual indemnification obligations are recorded as discontinued operations at january  management will periodically update its estimate as information about any potential liability becomes available
