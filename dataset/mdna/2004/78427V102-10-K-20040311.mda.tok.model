our fiscal year is based on a calendar year and ends each year on the saturday closest to december of that year 
as a result  our fiscal year may be comprised of or weeks 
our  and fiscal years each had weeks 
overview during the past year  si international experienced growth in our key focus areas 
department of defense as a customer concentration has continued to grow more rapidly which can be attributed to two primary drivers 
the dod budget was approved well before its civilian budget counterparts  and the push for defense transformation increased 
the dod budget imperative has been a catalyst for early adoption of the defense appropriation legislation and a smoother allocation of the associated funding 
this process has allowed our customers to effectively execute their it and network solution plans 
our view of the next three to five years is consistent with the pattern established in and virtually all of the dod efforts in which si international is engaged either directly support or are closely related to dod transformation goals 
however  we will continue to segment our focus areas in terms of homeland defense  it modernization  mission critical outsourcing  and defense transformation 
it is important that we reflect our customer s evolving priorities through our characterization of the programs in each focus area 
we are  first and foremost  a provider of information technology and network solutions to the federal government 
our clients include the us air force space command  us army  the department of state  the immigration and naturalization service  which has now transitioned to become the bureau of citizenship and immigration services in the department of homeland security  and the intelligence community 
the addition of matcom will allow us to continue to support our existing customer base  while strengthening our position with the us army  us navy  us air force electronic systems center  and us department of agriculture  and opening new client relationships with the federal retirement thrift investment board  and national institutes of health 
we combine our technology and industry expertise to provide a full spectrum of state of the practice solutions and services  from design and development to implementation and operations  which assist our clients in achieving mission success 
in fiscal and fiscal  we received and  respectively  of our revenues from services we provided to various departments and agencies of the federal government  both directly and through other prime contractors  and and  respectively  of our total revenues from work performed for commercial entities 
the following table shows our revenues from the client groups listed as a percentage of total revenue 
revenue data for the department of defense includes revenue generated from work performed under engagements for both the department of defense and the intelligence community 
fiscal year department of defense federal civilian agencies commercial entities total revenue as a result of the acquisition of matcom  the percentage of our revenues attributable to the department of defense may decrease marginally  the percentage of our revenue attributable to federal civilian agencies may marginally increase  and the percentage of our revenue attributable to commercial entities  including international operations  may decrease marginally 
we have derived a substantial majority of our revenues from governmental contracts under which we act as a prime contractor 
we also provide services indirectly as a subcontractor 
we intend to focus on retaining and increasing the percentage of our business as prime contractor because it provides us with stronger client relationships 
the following table shows our revenues as prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenue for the following periods fiscal year prime contract revenue subcontract revenue total revenue as a result of the acquisition of matcom  we believe the percentage of our prime contract revenue may decrease slightly 
our services are provided under three types of contracts cost reimbursable  time and materials and fixed price contracts 
the following table shows our revenues from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of our total revenue for the following periods fiscal year cost reimbursable time and materials fixed price total as a result of the acquisition of matcom  we anticipate that during fiscal year that the percentage of our revenue attributable to time and materials contracts may increase meaningfully  that the percentage of our revenue attributable to fixed price contracts may decrease slightly  and that the percentage of our revenue attributable to cost reimbursable contracts may decrease meaningfully 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for costs that are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract  and paid a fee representing the profit margin negotiated between us and the contracting agency  which may be fixed or performance based 
under cost reimbursable contracts we recognize revenues and an estimate of applicable fees earned as costs are incurred 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
in general  cost reimbursable contracts are the least profitable of our government contracts 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials  costs and expenses 
to the extent that our actual labor costs under a time and materials contract are higher or lower than the billing rates under the contract  our profit under the contract may either be greater or less than we anticipated or we may suffer a loss under the contract 
we recognize revenues under time and materials contracts by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended by the contract billing rates and adding the effect of other billable direct costs 
in general  we realize a higher profit margin on work performed under time and materials contracts than cost reimbursable contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a fixed price 
compared to cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns in return for the full benefit of any cost savings 
we generally do not undertake complex  high risk work  such as long term software development  under fixed price terms 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance over a defined period 
revenue on fixed price contracts that provide for the company to render services throughout a period is recognized as earned according to contract terms as the service is provided on a proportionate performance basis 
while a substantial number of these contracts are generally less than six months in duration  we have several multi year contracts of this type in which the customer has the option to extend the contractual term beyond the current term 
if we anticipate a loss on a contract  we provide for the full amount of anticipated loss at the time of that determination 
our most significant expense is direct cost  which consists primarily of direct labor costs for program personnel and direct expenses incurred to complete contracts  including cost of materials and subcontract efforts 
our ability to predict accurately the number and types of personnel  their salaries  and other costs  can have a significant impact on our direct cost 
the allowability of certain direct and indirect costs in federal contracts is subject to audit by the client  usually through the dcaa 
certain indirect costs are charged to contracts and paid by the client using provisional  or estimated  indirect rates  which are subject to later revision  based on the government audits of those costs 
approximately of our revenue recognized during fiscal was derived from contracts that we expect will become subject to competitive bids prior to the end of government fiscal as a result of the acquisition of matcom  we believe the percentage of our revenue subject to competitive bids prior to the end of the government fiscal year will decrease 
we actively monitor our relationships with our clients during our engagements  as well as the quality of the service we provide  to assist in our efforts to win recompetition bids 
in addition  we strive to maintain good relationships with a wide variety of government contractors 
recent events on january   we completed the purchase of matcom  a provider of information technology  systems engineering  logistics  and training 
the acquisition supports our strategic growth plan to expand into new vertical markets and enhance the portfolio of capabilities we provide to the federal government 
under the terms of the agreement  si international acquired matcom for million in cash 
the transaction also includes an earnout provision of million in the form of si international subordinated notes if matcom achieves certain short term revenue objectives 
the transaction was funded through cash on hand and borrowings under the company s credit facility  which has been increased to million

direct costs 
direct costs include direct labor and other direct costs such as materials and subcontracts

as a percentage of revenue  income from operations was for fiscal as compared to in fiscal we anticipate continued improvement in our operating margin 
interest expense 
for fiscal  interest expense declined to million from million for the same period in this decline was attributable primarily to the repayment of debt following our initial public offering in november as a percentage of revenue  interest expense was for fiscal as compared to for the same period in fiscal we anticipate an increase in interest expense in fiscal year due to amounts borrowed under our current credit facility  which was made in connection with the acquisition of matcom

as anticipated  commercial and other revenues decreased to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to our continuing de emphasis of marketing activities in the commercial sector 
the decrease in our commercial work was largely the result of decreased spending by our customers in the commercial telecom market and the petroleum reservoir modeling business 
consistent with our decision in june to merge si telecom back into si international and our decision to de emphasize our petroleum business  we have concentrated on our core federal government contracting business

supplemental quarterly information the following table sets forth quarterly unaudited consolidated financial data for the fiscal quarters of and  expressed in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues for the respective periods 
we believe that this unaudited financial information includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for each period 
all of the fiscal quarters reflected in the following table had thirteen weeks 
some unevenness of revenue from quarter to quarter exists primarily because of the timing of purchases of materials necessary to perform certain obligations under our cisr contract with us air force space command

following the closing of our initial public offering on november   we entered into a new million secured revolving credit facility the credit facility with wachovia bank  na acting as administration agent for a consortium of lenders 
we replaced all letters of credit outstanding under our prior credit facility with letters of credit issued under the new facility 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december  we did not have any borrowings under the credit facility 
in connection with the acquisition of matcom international corporation on january   we amended our credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity from million to million and extended the term to january  the amended credit facility includes a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
under the term loan  we are required to make three million quarterly principal payments starting on june   eight million quarterly principal payments starting on march   three million quarterly principal payments starting on march   and a final million principal payment on december  the amended credit facility permits us  subject to our compliance with financial and nonfinancial covenants and customary conditions  to make up to million of revolving credit borrowings and also provides for the issuance of letters of credit  although the amount of available revolving credit borrowings are reduced by the amount of any outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility 
see risk factors our indebtedness and debt service obligations may increase substantially and we will be subject to restriction under debt instruments 
any borrowings outstanding under the facility will  at our option  bear interest either at floating rates equal to libor plus a spread ranging from to basis points or a specified base rate plus a spread ranging from to basis points  with the exact spread determined upon the basis of our ratio of outstanding indebtedness to our earnings before interest  taxes  and depreciation and amortization expense  as defined in the new credit facility 
we and each of our existing and future subsidiaries are jointly and severally liable with respect to the payment of all borrowings and other amounts due and performance of all obligations under the new credit facility 
the new credit facility is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our current and future tangible and intangible assets  as well as those of our current and future subsidiaries  including accounts receivable  inventory and capital stock of our existing and future subsidiaries 
the new credit facility requires us to make mandatory prepayments of outstanding borrowings  with a corresponding reduction in the maximum amount of borrowings available under the facility  with net proceeds from certain insurance recoveries and asset sales  and with of the net proceeds from debt issuances  and with of the net proceeds from certain equity issuances subject to specified exceptions 
also  the new credit facility includes a number of restrictive covenants including  among other things  limitations on our leverage and capital expenditures  limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens  requirements that we maintain minimum ratios of cash flow to fixed charges and prohibitions on payment of dividends on our capital stock  limitations on our ability to enter into mergers  acquisitions or sales of our assets  and prohibitions on certain transactions among our subsidiaries and affiliated companies 
the new credit facility also contains events of default  including  among other events  any transaction resulting in a new stockholder or group of stockholders acquiring control of our board of directors or ownership of greater than of our outstanding capital stock  any default by us under any material government contract or other material contract to which we are a party  the suspension of our ability to enter into contracts with the federal  state or local governments generally 
see risks related to our business our indebtedness and debt service obligations may increase substantially and we will be subject to restrictions under debt instruments 
we currently anticipate that cash flow from operations and borrowings available under our new credit facility will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated capital needs for at least the next twelve months  but may be insufficient to provide funds necessary for any future acquisitions we may make  whether during the next twelve months or thereafter 
to the extent that we require additional funds  whether for acquisitions or otherwise  we may seek additional equity or debt financing 
such financing may not be available to us on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all  and any equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders 
to the extent that we obtain additional debt financing  our debt service obligations will increase and the relevant debt instruments may  among other things  impose additional restrictions on our operations  require us to comply with additional financial covenants or require us to pledge assets to secure our borrowings 
financial data for all of our subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial statements 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease operating lease      total      purchase obligations related to existing contracts are with the federal government and  in the event any contracts are terminated  we would have the ability to submit a termination claim for outstanding purchases

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition to be critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
our critical accounting policies also include the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly difficult  subjective or complex judgments in making estimates  and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could be different from these estimates 
revenue recognition our accounting policy regarding revenue recognition is written to comply with the following criteria a contract has been executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of services or products has occurred  and collectibility of the contract price is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
compliance with these criteria may require us to make significant judgments and estimates 
for cost reimbursable contracts with fixed fees and fixed price contracts  we estimate the applicable fees earned as costs are incurred or services are provided 
this process requires estimation of the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under contract  the cost of such effort and ongoing assessment towards completing the contract 
we utilize a number of management processes to monitor contract performance and revenue estimates  including monthly in process reviews 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fees  we estimate the applicable fees earned based on historical experience and performance evaluations from our customers 
for fixed price contracts that are based on unit pricing  we recognize revenue for the number of units delivered in any given fiscal period 
for fixed price contracts that are based on the proportionate performance method and involve a specified number of similar acts  we recognize revenue based on the proportion of those acts completed compared to the number of total specified acts required by the contract 
for fixed price contracts that are based on the proportionate performance method and involve a specified number of defined but not similar acts  we recognize revenue based on the proportion of the project s percentage total costs incurred compared to the estimated total costs associated with the entire transaction 
occasionally  facts may develop that require revisions to estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative effect of any such revisions is recorded in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known 
the full amount of anticipated losses on any contract type are recognized in the period in which they become known 
in addition  certain indirect costs are charged to contracts and paid by the client using provisional  or estimated  indirect rates that are subject to later revision based on government audits 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk historically  our investment positions have been relatively small and short term in nature 
we have typically made investments in a fund with an effective average maturity of fewer than days having a portfolio make up consisting primarily of commercial paper and notes and variable rate instruments  and to a much smaller extent overnight securities and bank instruments 
since our initial public offering  the board of directors approved an investment policy that requires we invest in relatively short term  high quality  and high liquidity obligations
