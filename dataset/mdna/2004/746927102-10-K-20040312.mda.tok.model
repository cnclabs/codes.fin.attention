on february th   the company announced its decision to discontinue the phase iii multiple basal cell carcinoma mbcc study that had been enrolling patients since october the company had previously announced that enrollment in this study had been slow  the company decided to halt the mbcc trial study due to the length of time which would have been required to complete the study and the relatively small market potential for this indication 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to make certain estimates  judgements and assumptions that the company believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
significant estimates are used for  but not limited to  provisions for non completion of inventory  assessment of the net realizable value of long lived assets  accruals for contract manufacturing and research and development agreements  allocation of costs to manufacturing under a standard costing system  taxes and contingencies 
the significant accounting policies which the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include those which follow reporting currency and foreign currency translation effective december the company changed its reporting currency to the us dollar from the canadian dollar 
the consolidated financial statements of the company are translated into us dollars using the current rate method 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date 
shareholders equity is translated at the applicable historical rates 
revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average rates of exchange for the respective years 
translation gains and losses are included as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment which is reported as a component of shareholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the financial information for the year ended december  is presented in us dollars as if the us dollar had been used as the reporting currency during that period 
the company adopted the us dollar as its reporting currency in order to provide information on a more comparable basis with the majority of the companies in the company s peer group 
the company retained the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the canadian and us dollars can affect the reported value of canadian dollar denominated assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar during resulted in a higher reported value for the company s canadian dollar denominated assets and liabilities as compared to the impact on the company s canadian dollar denominated cash and short term investments reported value was approximately million higher  and the impact on inventory was approximately million higher 
revenue recognition under the terms of the company s collaborative agreement with novartis ophthalmics  the company is responsible for manufacturing and product supply and novartis ophthalmics is responsible for marketing and distribution of visudyne 
our agreement with novartis ophthalmics provides that the calculation of total revenue for the sale of visudyne be composed of three components an advance on the cost of inventory sold to novartis ophthalmics  an amount equal to of the profit that novartis ophthalmics derives from the sale of visudyne to end users  and the reimbursement of other specified costs incurred and paid for by the company 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of visudyne when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery to novartis ophthalmics has occurred  the end selling price of visudyne is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company is able to determine the final pricing of visudyne only upon sell through by novartis ophthalmics to the end users 
the company s revenue from visudyne is impacted by the cost of producing visudyne  the selling price of visudyne to end users  visudyne related costs incurred by novartis ophthalmics  and reimbursable costs incurred by the company 
the company does not offer rebates or discounts and has not experienced any material product returns  accordingly  the company does not provide an allowance for rebates  discounts and returns 
cost of sales cost of sales  consisting of expenses related to the production of bulk visudyne sold to novartis ophthalmics  and royalties on visudyne sales  are charged against earnings in the period of the related product sale by novartis ophthalmics to third parties 
the company utilizes a standard costing system  which includes a reasonable allocation of overhead expenses  to account for inventory and cost of sales  with adjustments being made periodically to reflect current conditions 
overhead expenses comprise direct and indirect support activities related to the manufacture of bulk visudyne and involve costs associated with activities such as quality inspection  quality assurance  supply chain management  safety and regulatory 
overhead expenses are allocated to inventory during each stage of the manufacturing process under a standard costing system  and eventually to cost of sales as the related products are sold by novartis ophthalmics to third parties 
variances from standard can occur due to changes in actual pricing and production volumes 
while the company believes its standards are reliable  actual production costs and volume changes may impact inventory  cost of sales  and the absorption of production overheads 
the company records a provision for the non completion of product inventory based on its history of batch completion to provide for potential failure of inventory batches in production to pass quality inspection 
the provision is calculated at each stage of the manufacturing process 
the company estimates its non completion rate based on past production and adjusts its provision quarterly based on actual production volume 
a batch failure may utilize a significant portion of the provision as a single completed batch currently costs between million and million  depending on the stage of production

the use of this model requires certain assumptions regarding the volatility  term  and risk free interest rate experienced by the holder
