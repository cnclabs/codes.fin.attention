item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a leading seaborne transporter of crude oil and refined petroleum products operating in the international shipping markets 
our fleet currently comprises vessels including one handysize product carrier delivered february  aggregating approximately million dwt  consisting of ten suezmaxes including two chartered in vessels  three panamax tankers carrying crude oil  two panamax product carriers  handysize and handymax product carriers  two handysize crude oil tankers and one ulcc 
in the discussions that follow  we sometimes refer to our crude oil tankers as the crude oil fleet and our product carriers as our clean fleet 
please see part i  items  business and properties our fleet for a list of our vessels 
financial summary our activities have supported our business strategies and also enhanced our competitive strengths 
omi s operating results for fiscal year were at record levels since the company s spin off from the domestic company  omi corp 
in the revenues and operating income  excluding losses from disposals  non cash losses and settlement loss of million and million  respectively  increased over by and  respectively 
there were several key drivers for the increases in revenues and operating income including increased spot rates in the suezmax tanker market  increased number of revenue earning operating days from adding modern vessels to our fleet  increased marketability of our vessels by forming strategic alliances and capitalizing on our experience and reputation in the industry  increased utilization of our vessels and low costs from operating an efficient and young fleet of vessels 
due to our strong financial performance  we were able to continue to meet our goal of strengthening our balance sheet  and at the same time  we continued to grow as a company by acquiring six modern vessels in and contracting to build eight product carriers that will be delivered in  and we have increased revenue and operating income by operating primarily a modernized fleet of double hull vessels through strategic acquisitions 
the key elements of our strategy are concentrate in two vessel categories suezmax tankers which offer size advantages and geographic flexibility over other vessel categories and product carriers because of steady demand for petroleum products in areas where there are no refineries nearby  maintain an optimal balance for purchasing and or selling vessels as market conditions and opportunities arise while maintaining prudent financial ratios eg leverage ratio  enter into strategic alliances that provide us with market opportunities that maximize our vessel utilization and earnings and blend long term contract revenues at attractive rates and predictable profits  with our ability to capture upside in stronger spot markets 
this strategy has been effective in strong and weak tanker markets  giving us comfort when we look at the vagaries of the shipping market 
we have been very successful in managing our business risk by operating our crude oil carriers  which are approximately of our aggregate deadweight dwt  in the spot market giving us the ability to take advantage of high rates in strong markets yet  and at the same time  securing revenue with long term contract revenue at attractive rates by time chartering our product carriers 
currently vessels of our vessels are on time charters  approximately or six vessels of which have profit sharing arrangements  have a floor rate and profit sharing without a cap 
these profit sharing arrangements enable us to benefit from strong tanker markets while protecting our downside 
the spot market  on the other hand  is very volatile and spot rates fluctuate with changing market and economic changes see market overview 
our company benefited the most in from the strong tanker market resulting in higher earnings for the suezmax fleet 
average rates earned in for the suezmax fleet were higher than average rates earned in during the first quarter of  the spot market is even stronger then in the fourth quarter with average daily suezmax rates at approximately  for the majority of the quarter compared to the fourth quarter average daily rate of  due to the seasonal nature of this business  we anticipate rates to be lower in the second and third quarters compared to the first quarter of  however  we expect rates to be seasonally strong 
fourth quarter rates are typically stronger than the second and third quarters  and we expect rates during that quarter to be stronger than the normal increase because of the need to replenish inventories in anticipation of colder months ahead 
the company studies key performance indicators and trends when making key financial decisions in managing our risk  such as world oil demand increases decreases in consumption of oil  tonne mile demand  long haul versus short haul voyages or trading routes  world oil supply by geographic regions  world tanker newbuildings orderbook  deletions scrappings  and average tanker rates by vessel dwt 
which is the price to transport crude oil and refined petroleum products determined by the market factors and the supply of and demand for tankers 
during  new regulations  discussed in detail in the market overview  that call for phasing out of single hull vessels has actually impacted owners with modern fleets positively 
because of our fleet is double hulled excluding the three vessels we plan to dispose of in  we will benefit from the additional demand for tonnage that was previously met by single hull vessels 
financing for shipping companies has been more attractive this year then in the recent past years 
during the first half of the year  we amended various loan agreements resulting in more favorable margins and more flexible terms 
two of our largest credit facilities were modified and resulted in several benefits for us removal of certain restrictive covenants  reduction of the margin over libor  additional liquidity and extension of the facility for an additional five years 
although our average debt balances were higher in compared to as a result of vessel purchases  our interest expense was lower in comparison  due to reduction in margins and low interest rates 
the following are several other significant items that occurred during the year ended we acquired six vessels during  four of which began three and five year time charters upon delivery 
we ordered six  dwt a ice class product carrier newbuildings in addition to one ordered in late in march  we ordered a  dwt a ice class product carrier newbuilding 
in february  one vessel was delivered and began a five year time charter 
the aggregate purchase price of the eight vessels was million prior to the delivery of the vessel in february three of the remaining seven vessels are scheduled to be delivered in  three in and one in we have entered into five year time charters for four of the seven vessels yet to be delivered 
we sold five single hull product carriers  which resulted in loss on disposals aggregating million 
our management approved a plan to sell its largest single hull ulcc vessel at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value 
the net book value of million  at december   was reclassified to vessels held for sale in the current asset section of the balance sheet 
we have taken an impairment charge of million for two single hull panamax vessels 
in march  these vessels were reclassified to vessels held for sale 
as a result of recent regulations see market overview  omi reduced the depreciable lives of two vessels  which will accelerate the depreciation expense by million a year from to and million from to during november  we issued million of senior unsecured notes the notes 
the notes bear interest at and are due in the proceeds of the notes have been used to pay down outstanding balances under the company s revolving credit facilities and for general corporate purposes 
omi reached an agreement with the department of justice pursuant to which we pleaded guilty to one count of knowingly violating regulations promulgated under the act to prevent pollution from ships by failing to maintain an oil record book on one of our vessels 
the violations were the result of crew members on vessel acting in violation of company policies without the knowledge of omi management 
sentencing is scheduled for may if the presiding judge sentences us according to the agreement  we will pay a million fine and serve a probationary period of three years 
the amount of the anticipated fine and related expenses  aggregating million has been expensed in the fourth quarter any amounts received under insurance policies will be recognized when received 
in  the company plans to maintain its focus on the areas discussed above and continue to build its capabilities as a leading transporter of crude oil and refined petroleum products 
see financial condition and capital resources 
market overview tanker charter rates are determined in a highly competitive market and depend on the supply of and demand for tanker capacity 
demand for tankers depends primarily on the volume of crude oil and petroleum products transported as well as the distance over which they are carried 
such demand is a function of world economic conditions and the resulting need for oil  world oil production and consumption patterns  as well as events which interrupt oil production  trade routes and consumption 
the supply of tankers depends primarily on the level of the orderbook  the fleet age profile  government regulations that affect the level of tanker scrappings and the behavior of tanker users  as well as the operating efficiency of the existing fleet 
please see items and business and properties regulations for additional discussion of the tanker industry  including projections relating to the supply of tankers and requirements of new regulations 
suezmax tanker overview the strong tanker market which began in the fourth quarter of continued in  and the average tce for suezmax tankers in the west africa to us trade was about double the level in the preceding year  and the second highest since this was the result of higher world oil demand due to improving world economic activity especially in the us  china and south east asia  cold weather during the winter months  a tight us natural gas market  and the decline of the us dollar  all occurring at a time of relatively low oil inventory levels 
furthermore  the tanker market benefited from a switch of combined carrier tonnage into the very strong dry bulk sector  heavy congestion out of the black sea due to adverse weather conditions  and more long haul middle east opec oil replacing the loss of iraqi oil production through a pipeline to the mediterranean and the persistent shortfall of oil production in venezuela  notwithstanding an increase in the world tanker fleet 
freight rates in the crude tanker market have continued to be strong thus far in

note as at source industry sources the average opec oil production in totaled about million barrels per day b d  up by million b d compared to at the same time  the average oil output by the long haul middle east opec producers totaled million b d  up by million b d compared to currently  opec oil production  including iraq  is estimated to be close to million b d  substantially above its quota and the year ago level  as its members have not implemented the oil production cut effective november  given the tight oil markets and high oil prices 
however  opec oil producers recently announced their commitment to comply with their current oil production quotas  and to reduce them by million b d  to million b d excluding iraq  beginning april  according to opec oil producers  this decision was taken in order to support oil prices during the expected seasonal decrease in the demand for oil in the second quarter 
world oil demand increased by about million b d in or about from the level  well above the gains in each of the previous three years 
world oil demand is expected to increase by about million b d in this is due to increased world economic activity especially in the united states  latin america  china and southeast asia  a tight us natural gas market  and the decline of the us dollar that makes oil purchases in local currencies less expensive 
total commercial crude oil and petroleum products inventories in the united states  western europe and japan at the end of january were about million barrels  or higher than the year earlier level  but below the average of the last five years 
at the same time  crude oil inventories were and petroleum products inventories were below the average of the last five years  respectively 
oil inventories are expected to increase in the first half of  but decrease in the later part of the year  and by year end be at about the same level as at the end of the world tanker fleet totaled million dwt at the end of  up by million dwt or from the year end level 
the tanker orderbook totaled about million dwt  or of the existing fleet at the end of approximately million dwt are for delivery in  million dwt in  million dwt in and the balance in the tanker orderbook includes suezmaxes of about million dwt or of the existing internationally trading suezmax tanker fleet 
the accelerated phase out of single hull tankers due to new imo and european union eu regulations is expected to moderate the effect of the relatively large tanker orderbook 
at the end of  approximately million dwt or of the total tanker fleet was or more years old  including million dwt or of the fleet which was or more years old 
furthermore  suezmaxes were or more years old  including which were or more years old 
tanker deletions totaled million dwt between and  or on average of approximately million dwt per year 
such deletions totaled about million dwt in  notwithstanding the strong tanker freight rate environment 
these deletions include suezmaxes and vlccs 
tanker deletions are likely to be high in the next few years given the age profile of the tanker fleet and stricter regulations

omi 
the eu adopted new tanker regulations which commenced on october  these regulations immediately prevent single hull tankers from carrying heavy fuel oil in eu waters  accelerate the phase out of single hull tankers with phase out dates depending upon the year of construction and whether the tanker has segregated ballast tanks  and force all single hull tankers to comply with the condition assessment scheme cas from the age of years  commencing in in response to the european union regulations  the imo adopted the following new strict tanker regulations at its december  meeting prevent single hull tankers of  dwt and above from carrying heavy fuel oils from early april accelerate the phase out of single hull tankers to instead of  in line with eu rules 
this means that  single hull tankers without segregated ballast tanks which are  dwt and over and carry crude oil  fuel oil  heavy diesel oil or lubricating oil as cargo  and  dwt and over carrying other than the above will be banned beginning early april single hull tankers of the size specified above with segregated ballast tanks and tankers  dwt and over but less than that specified above will be banned by the tankers will comply with the requirements not later than the anniversary date of delivery of the ship in the year specified as follows single hull tankers without segregated ballast tanks category phased out date april  for tankers delivered on april  or earlier for tankers delivered after april  single hull tanks with segregated ballast tanks category and tankers  dwt and over but less than the sizes specified above category phase out date april  for tankers delivered on april  or earlier for tankers delivered after april  but before january  for tankers delivered in and for tankers delivered in and for tankers delivered in for tankers delivered in for tankers delivered in or later allow the flag state to permit continued operation of category or tankers beyond subject to satisfactory result from the cas  which will be applicable to all single hull tankers years or older 
however  tankers will not be allowed to trade beyond the anniversary of the date of delivery of the ship in or the date on which the ship reaches years of age  whichever is earlier 
finally  tankers with only double sides or double bottoms will be allowed to operate beyond  provided that these tankers were in service on july  furthermore  such tankers will not be allowed to operate beyond the date on which they become years of age after the date of delivery 
these new imo regulations will commence on april  at the end of  there were million dwt of tankers or of the total tanker fleet which will be affected by these regulations 
product tanker overview freight rates in the product tanker market increased substantially in and the average spot tce for handysize product tankers in the caribbean was more than higher than the previous year  and the second highest since the product tanker market improvement was the result of increasing world economic activity especially in the us  china and southeast asia  a tight us gas market and the usual seasonal oil demand gains at a time of relatively low oil inventories in the atlantic basin  notwithstanding a substantial increase of the world product tanker fleet 
freight rates in the product tanker market have continued at very high levels thus far in the world product tanker fleet totaled about million dwt at the end of  up by about from the year end level 
the product tanker orderbook for delivery over the next few years totals about million dwt  or about of the existing product tanker fleet at the end of approximately million dwt are for delivery in  million dwt in  million dwt in and the balance in at the end of  approximately million dwt or of the existing fleet was or more years old 
the orderbook for handysize and handymax product tankers at the end of totaled about million dwt or of the existing handysize and handymax product tanker fleet 
product tanker seaborne trade  measured in tonne miles  increased by in compared to a compound rate of approximately per annum during the period 
this was the result of increasing world oil consumption  shortage of refinery capacity in major consumption areas and increased refinery capacity in oil exporting regions 

c linechartjpg 
source fearnleys  oslo the tanker market is expected to benefit from higher world oil demand due to improving world economic activity  especially in the us  latin america  china and southeast asia  possible disruptions due to political instability in short haul oil producers venezuela and nigeria and stricter tanker regulations by imo and the european union 
however  given the high tanker orderbook  tanker rates will depend on the level of world economic activity and oil demand growth as well as the total amount of tanker scrappings 
critical accounting estimates the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates  judgments  assumptions and form opinions in applying our accounting policies that significantly impact the results we report in our financial statements 
our most critical accounting estimates include revenue expense recognition for voyage charters  evaluation for impairment on long lived assets  depreciation expense and drydock amortization because they generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
revenue recognition omi generates operating revenue from two types of charters  time charters and voyage charters 
time charters are for a specific period of time at a specific rate per unit day or month of time  and are generally not as complex or as subjective as voyage charters 
under a voyage charter  or a charter in the spot market  we agree to provide a vessel for the transport of specific goods between specific ports in return for the payment of an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or  alternatively  for a specified total amount 
all operating costs are for our account 
voyage expenses  such as fuel and port charges  are recognized ratably over the duration of the voyage 
we recognize voyage revenue and voyage expenses on the percentage of completion method of accounting  which is the most prevalent method of accounting for voyage revenue and expenses 
estimated losses under a voyage charter are provided for in full at the time such losses become evident 
revenue recognition for voyage charters may be calculated on either a load to load basis or on a discharge to discharge basis 
our accounting policy for recognition of voyage freight for vessels operating on voyage charters has been on the discharge to discharge basis 
under this method  voyage revenue is recognized evenly over the period from the departure of a vessel from its prior discharge port to departure from the next discharge port 
management believes that the discharge to discharge method is preferable because it eliminates the uncertainty associated with the location of the next load port 
this method is the predominant one used by the industry 
management uses judgment to estimate the number of days to a vessel s next discharge port to compute the amount of revenue and expense to recognize for voyages in progress at the end of each month using the percentage of completion method on a discharge to discharge basis 
management uses assumptions to determine these estimates that are supported by historical trends  more specifically about the operating capability of the vessel speed and fuel consumption and about the trading route and port 
actual results could differ from accruals that are included as estimates in the consolidated balance sheets under the classifications traffic receivables  prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued voyage and vessel liabilities  and also under voyage revenue and voyage expense categories included in the consolidated statements of income that are estimates in a period 
evaluation for impairments on long lived assets vessels and construction in progress cip payments are recorded at cost 
expenditures for maintenance  repairs and minor renewals are expensed 
major replacements and renewals are capitalized 
the carrying values of our vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of secondhand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings  which have been cyclical 
management reviews vessels for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that their values may have declined 
in order to evaluate impairment of a vessel  assumptions about the future condition of the vessel and its operations are made 
these assumptions are applied in a model in which we estimate the undiscounted projected future cash flows associated with the vessel and comparisons to the vessel s carrying value to determine if a writedown to fair value is required 
this process involves subjective assumptions about future events  and discount factors to be applied to projected cash flows when it is determined that an impairment exits 
estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the company s control such as the overall market and economic trends  new regulations  and other changes 
these factors can cause underperformance relative to expected operating results and impact the useful economic lives of the vessels 
consideration  evaluation and judgment is made for each of these factors when making assumptions about the future performance for each vessel 
management believes that the assumptions made to evaluate the vessels for impairment are appropriate and reasonable 
however  changes in circumstances or conditions affecting these assumptions could result in impairment charges in future periods that may be material 
during  laws and regulations have been adopted by the eu and by the imo  which phase out single hulled tankers at different periods from opa as a result  some vessels that are eligible to trade internationally will be unable to carry cargo to or from the united states  and some vessels that may trade in the us will be unable to trade elsewhere 
the eu s new tanker regulations commenced on october  the imo  in response to the eu regulations  also adopted new stricter tanker regulations at its december  meeting 
the new imo regulations will commence on april  see the market overview section for more details about the impact of the latest laws and regulations 
additionally  for an outline of phase out dates adopted by opa  eu and imo for our six single hulled vessels see part i  items business and properties regulations 
during our evaluation for impairment for the year ended december   omi evaluated each of the single hulled vessels undiscounted future cash flow in conjunction with current laws and regulations 
as a result of the impact of opa two of our panamax vessels are scheduled to be returned to omi in april and august of from their current trading in a panamax tanker pool 
as the vessels will be further restricted from trading in the future years coupled with other factors considered in the evaluation of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  which were less than the vessels carrying value  we wrote down the vessels to their discounted cash flow 
the provision for impairment losses for these vessels and aggregated million for the year ended december  in march  these vessels were reclassified to vessels held for sale 
depreciation expense depreciation for financial reporting purposes is provided on the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets up to the assets estimated salvage value 
we estimate the useful lives of our vessels to range from to years 
in the shipping industry  a year life is the norm 
management s judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 
in december  as a result of the imo adopting regulations which included new phase out dates  two of our single hull vessels depreciable lives were effected 
there was no writedown in the financial statements since the vessels were not impaired 
the phase out dates will increase the depreciation expense beginning in  resulting in accelerating depreciation expense between january and june originally was june by million a year for one vessel and january to august originally was august by million for the other vessel 
salvage  or scrap  value is based upon a vessel s lightweight tonnage lwt multiplied by a scrap rate 
we use a scrap rate of per lwt to compute each vessel s salvage value 
the estimated scrap value is used in the computation of depreciation expense and recoverability of the carrying value of each vessel when evaluating for impairment of vessels 
management s estimates for salvage values may differ from actual results 
drydock amortization there are three methods that are used by the shipping industry to account for drydockings  first is the prepaid method  drydock costs are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the period to the next scheduled drydock  second  is the accrual method  the estimated cost of the next scheduled drydock is accrued over the period preceding such drydock  and lastly  expensing drydocking costs in the period it is incurred 
the company uses the prepaid method of accounting for drydock expenses 
under the prepaid method  drydock expenses are capitalized and amortized until the next drydock  which we estimate to be a period of two to three years 
management believes the prepaid method better matches costs with revenue and minimizes any significant changes in estimates associated with the accrual method  including the disposal of vessels before a drydock which has been accrued before it is performed 
management uses judgment when estimating the period between drydocks performed  which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock expense 
if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock  the remaining balance in prepaid drydock is written off to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessels in the period when contracted 
our drydock amortization expense was million in this expense is included in depreciation and amortization expense 
the prepaid drydock balance at december  on the balance sheet of million represents unamortized prepaid drydock balances for six of our wholly owned vessels 
since our fleet has many new and young vessels our prepaid drydock balances and related amortization have been lower relative to the fleet size 
we anticipate the majority of our vessels to be drydocked within the next two years which will result in significant increases to amortization expenses relating to drydock 
results of operations overview our analysis and evaluation of our consolidated results of operations focuses on the operating performance of our crude oil and product carrier fleets 
our vessels are deployed under either medium to long term time charters or spot market charters 
revenues vary with each type of charter and prevailing shipping rates 
expenses also vary with each type of charter and further depend on the cost of fuel  the ports and canals used and the shipping route 
a time charter involves the placing of a vessel at the charterer s disposal for a set period of time during which the charterer may use the vessel in return for the payment by the charterer of a specified daily or monthly hire rate 
under a voyage charter in the spot market  the owner of a vessel agrees to provide the vessel for the transport of specific goods between specific ports in return for the payment of an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or  alternatively  for a specified total amount 
all operating costs are for the owner s account 
voyage and time charters are available for varying periods  ranging from a single trip to a long term arrangement 
in general  a long term charter assures the vessel owner of a consistent stream of revenue 
operating the vessel in the spot market affords the owner greater speculative opportunity  which may result in high rates when ships are in high demand or low rates possibly insufficient to cover costs when ship availability exceeds demand 
ship charter rates are affected by world economics  international events  weather conditions  strikes  governmental policies  supply and demand  and many other factors beyond our control 
consistent with industry practice  we use time charter equivalent  or tce  revenue which comprises revenue from vessels operating on time charters  or tc revenue  and voyage revenue less voyage expenses from vessels operating on voyage charters in the spot market 
tce revenue serves as a measure of analyzing fluctuations between financial periods and as a method of equating revenue generated from a voyage charter to time charter revenue 
tce revenue also serves as an industry standard for measuring revenue and comparing results between geographical regions and among competitors 
because our business has many distinct market segments based primarily on the size and design configuration of our vessels  the type of cargo our vessels are equipped to transport and the arrangements under which we charter our vessels  we present various other measures of our financial performance  including separate analysis of tce revenue for voyage spot charters and time charters  vessel operating income  which is equal to tce revenue less vessel expenses  charter hire expense and depreciation and amortization  the number of operating or tce revenue days  which is the number of days our vessels were available for employment  and average daily tce revenue and average daily vessel expense 
we also analyze the results of operations of our two reportable segments  crude oil fleet and product carrier fleet  and our vessel categories within those segments eg  suezmaxes and panamaxes  according to the same metrics 
vessel expenses include operating expenses such as crew related costs  stores  routine maintenance and repairs  insurance and miscellaneous 
these expenses are a function of the fleet size  utilization levels for certain expenses  requirements under laws  and by charterer and our standards 
charter hire expense is the payment made to the owner of the chartered in vessel for our use 
the owner is responsible for the vessel s operating expenses  in addition to drydock and capital expenditures 
we are responsible for the voyage expenses 
insurance expense varies with overall insurance market conditions as well as the insured s loss record  level of insurance and desired coverage 
we locked in rates with modest increases for most of our hull and machinery coverage  and p i insurance with multi year contracts 
however  one of our p i clubs  which is a mutual indemnity provider  assessed its members additional amounts for several past years due to its current financial needs resulting from the poor investment markets and an increased level of claims 
certain other insurances  such as basic war risk  also increased 
war risk premiums based on voyages into designated war risk areas are typically for the account of the charterers 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our net income was million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the following table summarizes our results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  net change in thousands voyage and time charter revenue    voyage expenses    time charter equivalent revenue    other revenue vessel expenses and charter hire expense    depreciation and amortization    general and administrative expenses    provision for settlement loss and related expenses   provision for impairment loss on vessels   loss on disposal of assets   operating income    interest expense   interest income gain loss on disposal of investments  other net benefit for income taxes   net income    time charter equivalent revenue we earned tce revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase in tce revenue of million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  is attributed to increases for vessels operating in the spot market of million and increases for vessels operating on time charter of million  illustrated in the discussion and tables below 
tce revenue vessels operating in the spot market during the year ended december   our average daily tce revenue  or tce rates  for our suezmax fleet and product carrier fleet showed significant improvement over the prior year 
there was an increase of or million in tce revenue earned in the spot market during the year ended december  over the comparable year improvements in the crude tanker fleet operating in the spot market were from higher spot rates beginning in late to resulting from several factors described in the financial summary and detail under market overview 
the following tables illustrate in thousands of dollars the increase in spot revenue earned during the year ended december  over the year ended for the years ended december  net change tce revenue for vessels on spot crude oil fleet    product carrier fleet    total    increase in spot revenue in increases in tce revenue earned by vessels operating in the spot market during the period compared to the are explained in more detail as follows increases in crude oil fleet tce revenue for the suezmax vessels increased by million primarily due to the additional revenue earned by two vessels acquired in the fourth quarter of  two vessels acquired in august and two vessels not owned by omi that began operating in the new suezmax pool in december all of which resulted in more operating days in additionally  average daily tce for suezmax vessels for the year ended december   was higher due to improved spot rates compared to the average daily tce earned for the year ended december increases in tce revenue for the panamax and ulcc vessels aggregating million were the result of improved average daily tce rates earned in compared to additionally  the ulcc incurred losses in as a result of the significant number of days that the vessel was unemployed 
increases in the product carrier fleet tce revenue for the product carriers operating in the spot market increased by million for the year ended december   because of higher rates earned which was offset by less operating days in due to five single hull vessels disposed of in and one disposed of in  and one chartered in vessel that was redelivered and offhire for drydock 
tce revenue vessels operating on time charters during  or million of our tce revenue was earned by vessels operating on time charters 
the tc revenue earned was million higher for the year ended december   compared to the period  however  the percent of tc revenue to total tce revenue declined in from for the year ended december  because the spot market was stronger in the following table compares tc revenue earned for the year ended december  to the tc revenue earned for the year ended december  in thousands of dollars and as a percent of total tce revenue for each and years for the years ended december  net change tce revenue for vessels on tc crude oil fleet   product carrier fleet    total    of tce revenue for vessels on tc to total tce revenue increases in tce revenue earned by vessels operating on time charters for the year ended december  compared to the year ended resulted from increases of million in the product carrier fleet due to  more operating days from newbuildings delivered in and increased operating days from newbuildings were attributed to the delivery of four newbuildings in january  march  april and july  more operating days for the three newbuildings delivered in january and march and additional days for the product carrier chartered in since october that began a time charter in april vessel expenses and charter hire expense vessel expense and charter hire expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  vessel expenses vessel expenses increased million or for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of additional expenses for the six vessels and five vessels acquired during and  respectively 
charter hire expense charter hire expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of a product carrier chartered in during the period of october to october  in addition to increased charter hire expense for the vessel chartered in during june after the sale leaseback and from the two vessels that commenced operating in the new suezmax pool in december depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million during the year ended december   because of the acquisition of vessels and amortization for drydock expense for drydocks performed in and general and administrative g a g a increased million for the year ended december   over the comparable period in because of additional expenses as a result of owning a larger fleet in as expected  g a expense was higher in because of the additional expense related to costs associated with implementation of the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of loss on disposal of assets loss on disposal of assets of million for the year ended december   compared to million in the comparable period in the loss resulted from the sale of five single hull handysize product carriers 
loss on disposal of assets for the year ended december   included a net loss of million resulting from the sale of one single hull handysize product carrier 
interest expense interest expense during the year ended december  decreased million compared to the year ended december  interest expense was less in despite the increase in the average outstanding debt of million for the year ended december  from the average debt balance of million 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily a result of lower average interest rates on bank debt for the year ended compared to the year ended offset by increased rates from the percent unsecured senior notes issued in november interest income interest income decreased during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower average rates on cash equivalents and lower notes receivable balances in gain loss on disposal of investments a gain on disposal of investments of million was recorded during the year ended december  the gain relates primarily to the final settlement of accounts for an investment that was dissolved in prior years 
the net loss of million on disposal of investments resulted primarily from the writedown of two investments offset partially by the gain from the sale of a marketable security
