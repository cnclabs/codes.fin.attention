item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements about our expectations related to realizing new revenue streams and obtaining future collaboration agreements that include milestone and or royalty payments  the success of our internal proprietary drug discovery activities and our future headcount requirements 
these statements involve significant risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and those described more fully under the caption risk factors above and in other reports filed by array biopharma with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview array biopharma is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of orally active drugs to address significant unmet medical needs 
our proprietary drug development pipeline is primarily focused on the treatment of cancer and inflammatory disease and includes several small molecule drug candidates that are designed to regulate targets in therapeutically important biologic pathways 
in addition  leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies access our drug discovery technologies and expertise through collaborations to design  create  optimize and evaluate drug candidates across a broad range of therapeutic areas 
our goal is to be the most efficient inventor of therapeutic products in the pharmaceutical industry 
using the array discovery platform  our integrated suite of drug discovery technologies  we have identified multiple drug candidates in our own proprietary programs and in collaborations with other drug companies 
our proprietary research has resulted in out licensing three programs to astrazeneca and genentech  two of the world s leading oncology companies 
since our inception through june   our out license and collaboration agreements have generated million in up front payments and million in milestone payments  and we have recognized million in research funding revenue from our collaborators 
under our existing out license and collaboration agreements  we have the potential to earn over million in additional milestone payments if we achieve all of the drug discovery objectives under these agreements  as well as royalties on any resulting product sales from different programs 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the near future as we continue to invest in our proprietary drug discovery programs 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities and revenue from our collaborators 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we generate revenue through the out licensing of select proprietary drug discovery programs for up front fees  research funding and potential development milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
four programs have been out licensed to date and as a result we received up front license or technology access fees of million in total from astrazeneca  genentech and amgen 
we are also entitled to receive development milestone payments and royalties on resulting product sales 
we intend to progress proprietary drug programs internally through clinical testing and continue to evaluate select programs for out licensing opportunities with pharmaceutical or biotechnology partners 
we also generate revenue through collaborations aimed at inventing drug candidates for our collaborators 
we receive research funding based on the number of full time equivalent employees contractually assigned to a program  plus certain expenses 
under certain of these agreements  we are entitled to receive additional payments upon the achievement of certain drug development milestones and or royalty payments based on sales of products created as a result of these collaborations 
in addition  we license our lead generation libraries  which are a collection of structurally related chemical compounds that may have the potential of becoming drug candidates  on a non exclusive basis to our collaborators for internal research purposes 
we retain all other rights to the compounds  which permits us to license the same compounds to other collaborators 
some of our lead generation library agreements allow our collaborators to obtain exclusive rights to commercialize particular compounds upon the payment of additional fees 
we are not currently adding or producing any new lead generation libraries 
for the fiscal year  and  lead generation library revenue represented  and  respectively  of total revenue 
this declining revenue trend is expected to continue in the future 
we sell our optimer building blocks  which are the starting materials used to create more complex chemical compounds in the drug discovery process  on a per compound basis without any restrictions on use 
custom collections of chemical compounds we create and custom chemical syntheses we perform under our collaboration agreements are typically charged on a per compound basis  plus a charge for research and development services 
collaboration revenue in our statement of operations includes revenue for lead generation and lead optimization  custom synthesis and process research  the development and sale of chemical compounds and the co development of proprietary drug programs we out license 
license  royalty and milestone revenue received under our collaboration agreements  which includes our out licensing agreements  is combined and reported separately from collaboration revenue 
we recognize revenue from fees under our collaboration agreements on a monthly basis as work is performed 
development and fixed fee revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
per compound revenue is recognized as compounds are shipped 
revenue from license fees and up front fees is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected period of the related research program 
payments received in advance of performance are recorded as advance payments from collaborators until the revenue is earned 
royalty revenue is recorded when earned 
portions of milestone payments are recognized as revenue when we have met the contracted performance criterion of the related milestone  while the balance of the payment is recognized ratably over the remainder of the research program 
revenue recognition related to license fees  up front payments and milestone payments could be accelerated in the event of early termination of programs 
although we have increased the number of our collaboration agreements  our top collaborators contributed over of our total revenue for fiscal and our top three collaborators  astrazeneca  genentech  and eli lilly accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
during fiscal  icos  merck and eli lilly  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
in general  our collaborators may terminate their collaboration agreements with us on to days prior notice 
cost of revenue consists mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits and other collaboration related costs  including recruiting and relocation  fine chemicals  supplies  small tools  facilities  depreciation and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs  excluding any costs related to research and development 
we review inventories periodically and reduce items considered to be slow moving or obsolete to estimated net realizable value through an appropriate reserve 
we reduced the carrying value of our lead generation library in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of difficult market conditions 
in fiscal we accelerated the evolution of our business model to focus primarily on drug discovery  increasing the investment in proprietary research and out licensing three proprietary drug programs 
due to this evolution  it is not expected that lead generation libraries will be a significant source of revenues in future periods  and no new lead generation libraries will be produced other than for array s own proprietary research 
in light of the foregoing  an in depth review of the inventory levels and carrying values for lead generation libraries  optimer building blocks and fine chemicals was undertaken during the third quarter of fiscal as a result of this review which was based on expected future sales and industry standards relating to net carrying values  it was determined that there was an excess level of lead generation library and optimer building block inventory 
it was also determined that inventory of fine chemicals used as the starting materials for lead generation libraries exceeded anticipated usage 
accordingly  the reserves were increased by million for these inventories 
we continue to assess the current levels and value of our inventories  and we may determine that further increases in our inventory reserves are necessary 
research and development expenses consist of the same type of scientific expenditures that comprise cost of revenue 
research and development expenses for collaborations consist of expenses related to the development of custom libraries  lead generation libraries and optimer building blocks where we have not yet proven technological feasibility 
costs associated with activities where technological feasibility has been proven are charged directly to cost of revenue 
research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery consist of all costs associated with the development of a program until it is out licensed 
subsequent costs that are not directly reimbursed for the development of our out licensed programs are included as research and development expenses for collaborations 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and associated fringe benefits and other management  business development  accounting  information technology and administration costs  including recruiting and relocation  consulting and professional services  travel and meals  advertising  sales commissions  facilities  depreciation and other office expenses 
in addition  termination related costs of approximately  associated with a reduction in workforce completed in march were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses 
we currently license or sell our compounds and enter into collaborations directly with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through opportunities identified by our business development group  senior management  scientists and customer referrals 
in addition  we license or sell our compounds and collaborations in japan through an agent 
international revenue represented of our total revenue during fiscal year  up significantly from for fiscal year our international revenue is attributable to both european and japanese collaborations and increased in fiscal due to our collaboration and out license agreements with astrazeneca 
all of our collaboration agreements and purchase orders are denominated in united states dollars 
we plan to continue to increase our investment in our proprietary research programs and to seek additional collaborations in which we participate in the success of our proprietary drug candidates through a combination of licensing fees  payments for continued research and down stream payments that include milestone and or royalty payments 
we intend to progress proprietary programs through clinical development while also evaluating opportunities for out licensing to maximize the risk adjusted return on our proprietary programs 
we also intend to continue to grow revenue with our existing collaborators and realize new revenue streams through collaborations with a diversified group of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
in addition  we expect to enter into additional agreements that allow us to participate in the success of potential drug candidates with our collaborators through milestone and or royalty payments 
deferred stock compensation we recorded compensation expense related to stock option grants of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the compensation expense related to stock option grants is charged to cost of revenue  research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses  based on the functional responsibility of the associated employee 
as of june   we had approximately  of remaining deferred stock compensation to be amortized in the first quarter of fiscal results of operations fiscal years ended june   and increase decrease years ended june  to to in thousands collaboration revenue    license  royalty and milestone revenue    total revenue    fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue for fiscal and remained relatively flat 
increased revenue from up front licenses and milestones largely offset the decline in collaboration revenue 
payments from astrazeneca for the up front license fee and phase i milestone for arry and the up front license payment from genentech represented the majority of the increase to license  royalty and milestone revenue 
decreased collaboration revenue from expired programs with icos  amgen  merck and vertex pharmaceuticals was partially offset by revenue earned from new collaborations with genentech  astrazeneca and genpath pharmaceuticals 
in addition  collaboration revenue from our lead generation libraries and optimer building blocks declined million in compared to primarily due to increased competition from foreign chemistry service providers 
as we devote more resources to drug discovery and our proprietary drug programs  we expect that revenue from the sale of our research tools will continue to decline as a percentage of total revenue 
fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue increased slightly in this increase was primarily the result of million of additional revenue generated from our lead optimization collaborations with icos  vertex pharmaceuticals  takeda  intermune  japan tobacco and syrrx  inc  and our custom library collaboration with a japanese collaborator 
this gain was partially offset by decreased revenue from subscriptions and sales of chemical compounds from our array discovery platform of million in compared to this decrease is attributable to a net reduction of million in sales of chemical compounds to a single major pharmaceutical company 
increase years ended june  to to in thousands cost of revenue    gross margin of revenue fiscal as compared to fiscal the increased cost of revenue and decreased gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal are related to increased costs associated with staffing the various collaborations  including increased scientific salaries and utility charges 
during  the average pricing received from collaborations decreased slightly from the prior year 
also  during we had a lower percentage of total revenue generated from subscriptions and sales of chemical compounds from lead generation libraries and optimer building blocks 
fiscal as compared to fiscal the increased cost of revenue and reduced gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal is related to increased costs to support the growth in our lead optimization collaborations over the same period 
these cost increases were primarily attributable to additional scientific staff  associated salaries and benefits  and the expenditures associated with equipping and commencing operations in our new and expanded facilities during the year 
also  during we had a lower percentage of total revenue generated from subscriptions and sales of chemical compounds from our array discovery platform 
increase years ended june  to to in thousands provision for excess inventory   fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  we accelerated the evolution of our business model to focus primarily on drug discovery  increasing the investment in proprietary research and out licensing three proprietary drug programs in december to astrazeneca and genentech for further development and commercialization 
due to this evolution  it is not expected that lead generation libraries will be a significant source of revenues in future periods  and no new lead generation libraries will be produced other than for our own proprietary research 
consequently  we reviewed the inventory levels and carrying values for lead generation libraries  optimer building blocks and fine chemicals during the third quarter of fiscal based on this review and on an analysis of expected future sales and industry standards relating to net carrying values  it was determined that there was an excess level of lead generation library and optimer building block inventory 
it was also determined that inventory of fine chemicals used as the starting materials for lead generation libraries exceeded anticipated usage 
accordingly  we increased the reserves for these inventories  which resulted in a non cash charge for excess inventory of million in the third quarter of fiscal fiscal as compared to fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we increased our inventory reserves for lead generation libraries by million 
the carrying values at that time were reduced in light of difficult market conditions and resulting declines in lead generation library revenue experienced during the second half of fiscal increase decrease years ended june  to to in thousands research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery    for collaborations    total research and development    fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery increased related to our expanded efforts to advance compounds into regulated safety testing 
in addition  a number of new programs were initiated during the year  and the lead compound in our mek for cancer program advanced through regulated safety assessment 
supporting these efforts were additional scientists and increased pharmacology studies 
we expect that proprietary research and development spending will continue to increase as we focus more resources on our proprietary drug discovery programs 
research and development expenses for collaborations declined in due to a reduced focus on creating new lead generation libraries and custom libraries 
partially offsetting this decline were increased costs from the phase i clinical trial that array is conducting as part of the astrazeneca collaboration 
fiscal as compared to fiscal the expansion of our proprietary drug discovery efforts was the main reason for the increase in research and development expense in fiscal over  and to a lesser degree spending for our lead generation libraries  optimer building blocks and custom library collaborations 
these expanded research efforts required the recruitment and relocation of additional scientific staff and associated salaries and benefits  and the expenditures associated with equipping and commencing operations in our new and expanded facilities 
increase decrease years ended june  to to in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses    fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is attributable to a march workforce reduction whereby we reduced our workforce by employees in order to reduce costs and match our headcount resources with the near term demand for our collaboration programs 
this reduction resulted in a fiscal charge to selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately  for termination related costs consisting primarily of severance payments and out placement services for affected employees 
the remaining year over year decrease was attributable to cost savings associated with the elimination of certain administrative positions that were affected by this reduction in workforce 
fiscal as compared to fiscal a portion of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was related to the march reduction in workforce described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses also increased during fiscal due to expanded management and increased business development and administrative staffing levels as well as increased facilities related expenditures 
increase decrease years ended june  to to in thousands compensation related to option grants    fiscal as compared to fiscal compensation expense relates to certain stock options that were granted prior to our november initial public offering 
this non cash charge is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the related options  which are generally four years  except for options with performance based vesting provisions 
fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in compensation related to stock options is the result of the expiration of unvested options upon termination of employment 
decrease years ended june  to to in thousands net interest income  fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to lower investment interest rates earned on a lower average cash balance 
fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to lower investment interest rates earned on a lower average cash balance 
no interest expense was incurred in any of the reportable years 
other expense loss on investment 
in march  we entered into a drug discovery collaboration agreement with aptus genomics  inc to create small molecule therapeutics against select g protein coupled receptor gpcr targets 
array worked exclusively with aptus on a select number of gpcr targets and provided aptus access to its lead generation libraries in exchange for  of common stock in aptus 
during fiscal  the value of aptus common stock decreased significantly 
we determined this reduction in value to be other than temporary and as a result  wrote off our investment in the company 
income taxes 
there was no current or deferred tax expense for the fiscal years ended june   or at june   we had federal and colorado income tax net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of million  which will expire beginning in and continuing through we have provided a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets  as we cannot assess that it is more likely than not that we will realize such tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources as of june  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities   working capital deficit excluding cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities    purchases of property  plant and equipment    cash flow provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    fiscal as compared to fiscal we have historically funded our operations through revenue from our collaborations and the issuance of equity securities 
as of june   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million compared to million at june  net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year  compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the same period in during fiscal year  our net loss of million was reduced by noncash charges of million associated with depreciation  compensation related to stock option grants and a provision for excess inventory 
for the fiscal year  our working capital  excluding cash and marketable securities  decreased by million primarily due to a million increase in the current portion of advance payments from collaborators and a million decrease in inventories 
advance payments from collaborators increased due to the receipt of up front license and milestone payments totaling million for fiscal we recognized million of these up front license and milestone payments as revenue during  and recorded the remaining amounts as advance payments from collaborators 
inventories decreased by million due to the increased inventory reserves for lead generation libraries  optimer building blocks and certain fine chemicals used as the starting materials for lead generation libraries 
during fiscal year  we invested million in capital equipment and leasehold improvements primarily associated with equipping and commencing operations in our new pharmacology and drug metabolism facilities 
financing activities provided million of cash resulting from the exercise of stock options under our stock option plan and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
fiscal as compared to fiscal as of june   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million compared to million at june  net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal year  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the same period in during fiscal year  our net loss of million was reduced by noncash charges of million associated with depreciation  compensation related to stock option grants  a provision for excess inventory and the unrealized investment loss  yet our working capital excluding cash and marketable securities increased by million 
working capital rose primarily due to declining liability balances within accounts payable and advance payments from customers 
during fiscal year  we invested million in capital equipment and leasehold improvements associated with equipping and commencing operations in our new and expanded facilities 
net proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable securities provided million of cash 
financing activities provided million of cash primarily related to exercise of stock options under our stock option plan and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
approximately  was received in september from one of array s founders as full repayment of an outstanding note receivable balance  including accrued interest 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the rate at which we grow our business and our investment in proprietary research activities  the ability of our current and future collaborators to fund outside research and development activities  our success in increasing sales of both existing and new products and collaborations  expenses associated with unforeseen litigation  regulatory changes  competition  technological developments  general economic conditions and potential future merger and acquisition activity 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and anticipated cash flow from existing collaboration agreements will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next months 
this estimate of our future capital requirements is a forward looking statement that is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual future capital requirements could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the progress of our research activities  our ability to enter into agreements to out license and co develop our proprietary drug candidates  the number and scope of our research programs  the progress of our preclinical and potential clinical development activities  the progress of the development efforts of our collaborators  our ability to establish and maintain current and new collaboration agreements  the ability of our collaborators to fund research and development programs  the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and the costs of establishing business development and distribution capabilities 
future capital requirements will also depend upon the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses  products and technologies 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  which we do not expect to achieve in the foreseeable future  we expect to continue to utilize our existing cash and marketable securities resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of our equity offerings 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining new or in retaining existing out license or collaboration agreements  in securing agreements for the co development of our proprietary drug candidates  or in receiving milestone and or royalty payments under those agreements  that our existing cash and marketable securities resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  this financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose  or may adversely affect our ability to operate as an ongoing concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
obligations and commitments the following table shows our contractual obligations and commitments as of june  payments due by period less than year years years after years total in thousands operating lease obligations     purchase obligations total obligations     we are obligated under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities and certain equipment 
lease terms for our facilities range from five to seven years with renewal options and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area and other operating costs 
equipment leases generally range from three to five years 
at june   we had restricted cash of million as a compensating balance to support outstanding standby letters of credit that were issued during the prior fiscal years in relation to our facilities leases 
critical accounting policies we believe the policies identified below are critical to the understanding of our results of operations and require our management to make significant judgments in preparing the financial statements included in this report 
management has made estimates and assumptions based on these policies 
we do not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported if different assumptions were used 
however  the application of these policies involves judgments and assumptions as to future events and  as a result  actual results could differ 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition we believe our revenue recognition policy is significant because the amount and timing of revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow the guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
 as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
which requires that a series of criteria be met in order to recognize revenue related to the performance of services or the shipment of products 
if these criteria are not met  the associated revenue is deferred until the criteria are met 
we recognize revenue when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b products are delivered or services are rendered  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collectibility is assured 
we recognize revenue from fees under our collaboration agreements on a monthly basis as work is performed 
development and fixed fee revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
per compound revenue is recognized as compounds are shipped 
revenue from license fees and up front fees is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected period of the related research program 
royalty revenue is recorded when earned 
portions of milestone payments are recognized as revenue when we have met the contracted performance criterion of the related milestone  while the balance of the payment is recognized ratably over the remainder of the research program 
revenue recognition related to license fees  up front payments and milestone payments could be accelerated in the event of early termination of programs 
in general  contract provisions include predetermined payment schedules or the submission of appropriate billing detail 
payments received in advance of performance are recorded as advance payments from collaborators until the revenue is earned 
we report revenue for lead generation and lead optimization research  custom synthesis and process research  the development and sale of chemical compounds and the co development of proprietary drug candidates we out license  as collaboration revenue 
license  royalty and milestone revenue is combined and reported separately from collaboration revenue 
inventory valuation our inventories primarily consist of individual chemical compounds in the form of optimer building blocks  lead generation libraries  custom libraries and commercially available fine chemicals 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
we have designed and produced chemical compounds comprising our optimer building blocks  lead generation libraries and custom libraries  and capitalize costs into inventory only after technological feasibility has been established 
we periodically review and  when required  write down the value of our inventories for non marketability to estimated net realizable value through an appropriate reserve when the cost of inventory exceeds its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
recent accounting pronouncement in january  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf statement no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition and how the revenue arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
eitf applies to all revenue arrangements that are executed in fiscal periods beginning after june  array adopted eitf during the quarter ended september  the adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly since a significant portion of our investments are and will be in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature and short term maturities of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
foreign currency rate fluctuations 
all of our collaboration agreements and purchase orders are denominated in united states dollars 
therefore  we are not exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
inflation 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented
