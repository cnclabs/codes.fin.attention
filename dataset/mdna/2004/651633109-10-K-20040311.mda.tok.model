item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business 
nevertheless  it is expected that the bank will account for most of newmil s net income in the foreseeable future 
the bank  which was organized in  is a connecticut chartered and federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insured savings bank headquartered in new milford  connecticut 
the bank s principal business consists of attracting deposits from the public and using such deposits  with other funds  to make various types of loans and investments 
the bank offers both consumer and commercial deposit accounts  including checking accounts  interest bearing now accounts  money market accounts  certificates of deposit  savings accounts  individual retirement accounts and sweep accounts 
the bank provides x access to banking through automated teller machines in sixteen branches  through its internet site at www 
newmil 
com and through bank by phone 
the bank offers a broad range of mortgage and consumer loans to the residents of its service area including residential mortgages  home equity credit lines and loans  installment loans and collateral loans 
the bank sells some of the residential mortgages that it originates on a servicing released basis 
the bank offers a broad range of mortgage and commercial loans to the companies and small businesses of its service area including lines of credit  term loans  small business administration sba loans  commercial real estate mortgages  and construction and development mortgages 
in addition  the bank offers services including money orders  travelers checks and safe deposit boxes 
although so empowered  the bank is not currently offering trust services 
newmil s results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  the real estate market  changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the general economic climate over the past several years has been favorable 
should these conditions deteriorate  newmil s operations could be adversely impacted 
market area and competition the bank conducts its business through nineteen full service offices  and one special needs office at an independent life care retirement community  located in connecticut s litchfield  fairfield and new haven counties 
the bank s service area  which has a population of approximately  enjoys a balance of manufacturing  trade  and service employment and is home to a number of fortune companies 
although the bank s primary market area is litchfield and northern fairfield counties  the bank has depositors and borrowers that live outside of these areas 

table of contents the bank faces strong competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in making mortgage and other loans 
its most direct competition for deposits has historically come from other savings banks and commercial banks located in its market area 
more recently  competition for deposits has developed from non banking companies such as brokerage houses that offer a range of deposit and deposit like products 
although the bank expects this continuing competition to have an effect upon the cost of funds  it does not anticipate any substantial adverse effect on maintaining the current deposit base 
the bank is competitive within its market area in the various deposit products it offers to depositors 
due to this fact  management believes the bank has the ability to maintain the deposit base 
the bank does not rely upon any individual  group or entity for a significant portion of its deposits 
the bank s competition for real estate loans comes primarily from mortgage banking companies  savings banks  commercial banks  insurance companies  and other institutional lenders 
the bank competes for loan originations primarily through the interest rates and loan fees it charges and the efficiency and quality of services it offers borrowers  real estate brokers and builders 
factors that affect competition include  among others  the general availability of funds and credit  general and local economic conditions  current interest rate levels and volatility in the mortgage markets 
congress passed legislation in providing for a phase in of full interstate branching 
connecticut law has since provided for full interstate banking and  more recently  has adopted legislation allowing interstate branching  subject to certain limitations 
in recent years several out of state financial institutions  almost all larger and with greater financial resources than the bank  have acquired connecticut financial institutions and begun operations in connecticut 
this has both increased competition in newmil s market areas and resulted in the reduction of locally based competition through consolidations 
newmil may consider expansion within or outside of connecticut provided appropriate opportunities and conditions exist

lending activities the bank offers a broad range of mortgage and consumer loans to the residents of its service area including residential mortgages  home equity credit lines and loans  installment loans and collateral loans 
the bank also offers a broad range of mortgage and commercial loans to the companies and small businesses of its service area including lines of credit  term loans  sba loans  commercial real estate mortgages  and construction and development mortgages 
one to four family residential mortgage loans the bank offers a variety of fixed and adjustable rate loans  including adjustable rate loans that have fixed rates for an initial period ranging from to years and adjust annually thereafter 
the bank offers amortization periods of up to years 
the bank s adjustable rate loans generally have a limit on the maximum rate change per interest rate adjustment of to  and have limits on the total interest rate adjustments during the life of a loan ranging from to  depending on the initial rate and type of loan 
the bank s adjustable rate loans include loans whose interest rate adjustments are based on us treasury constant maturity indices and other indices 
the bank s initial rates on adjustable rate mortgage loans are offered at levels which are intended to be competitive within the bank s service area and which are frequently at a discount from fully indexed contractual rates 
the bank charges origination fees ranging from no fee to several percent  depending on the initial rate and type of loan 
adjustable rate mortgage loans allow the bank to maintain a degree of rate sensitivity  though the extent of this sensitivity is limited by the re pricing intervals and caps contained in each loan type 
the bank s residential mortgage loans are underwritten based on the borrower s income in accordance with secondary market or investor standards 
in evaluating a potential residential mortgage borrower  the bank considers a number of factors  including the creditworthiness of the borrower  the capacity of the borrower to repay the loan  an appraisal of the property to be mortgaged and a review of the loan to value ratio 
some of the residential mortgage loans that the bank originates are originated for sale to generate fee income 
all such loans are sold on a servicing released basis 

table of contents collateral and installment loans the bank makes collateral and installment loans  including home equity lines of credit  home equity loans  automobile and other personal loans 
while the bank offers fixed rates on its consumer loans and home equity loans  its home equity lines of credit are generally offered at or a spread over or under the prime rate 
home equity loans and lines of credit have risks similar to those associated with residential mortgages discussed above 
commercial mortgage and multi family mortgage loans the bank also makes loans collateralized by mortgages on commercial and multi family residential properties 
commercial and multi family loans are offered on an adjustable rate basis  generally with a daily re pricing frequency and with the interest adjustment tied to the prime rate 
loans may also be structured with fixed rate terms ranging from to years 
loans collateralized by commercial properties  including multi family residential properties  can involve greater credit risks than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the commercial real estate business is cyclical and subject to downturns  over building  fluctuations in market value and local economic conditions 
typically  such loans are substantially larger than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because repayment is often dependent on the cash flow of a successfully operated or managed property  repayment of such loans may be more susceptible to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy generally than is the case with residential mortgages 
construction loans the bank also makes construction loans to individuals and professional builders for the purpose of constructing to family residential properties  either as a primary residence or for investment or resale 
commercial and industrial loans the bank offers secured commercial business loans  generally adjustable rate loans with the adjustment of interest based on the prime rate plus a spread 
the bank believes it has been conservative in its underwriting standards for this market with the goal of obtaining quality loans for the portfolio 
the bank also offers sba and other government guaranteed loans 
the bank s loan products are targeted for  and tailored to the needs of  the local business and professional community in the bank s market area 
the bank s legal lending limit to any one borrower at december  was million  or of tier i and tier ii capital 
generally  the bank s concentration to any one borrower does not exceed of the bank s legal lending limit and the average loan size is under  most business loans are secured by liens on business assets including inventory  receivables and or liens on real property 
in addition  most loans are further secured by the personal guaranty of the owners of the business

application of critical accounting policies newmil s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap and follow general practices within the banking industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
newmil s significant accounting policies are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in notes to consolidated financial statements and in management s discussion and analysis  provide information on how significant assets are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that 
table of contents requires the most subjective judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the balance sheet 
note describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the provision and allowance for loan losses section of management s discussion and analysis 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is regularly evaluated for impairment  in which case its carrying value would be reduced through a charge to earnings for any impairment 
core deposit and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are also regularly evaluated for impairment 
the valuation techniques used to determine the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets acquired in acquisitions and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
future events or changes in the estimates  which are used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affects their value or estimated lives could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations 
overview was an excellent year for newmil 
newmil earned net income of million  or per share  for  compared with net income of million  or per share  for this represented a increase in earnings per share for over newmil s results were achieved through growth in net interest income and non interest income  offset partially by increased non interest expense 
net interest income increased  as a result of an increase of million in average earning assets  primarily in average loans  offset somewhat by a slight decrease in the net interest margin  from in to in non interest income increased in  due primarily to increases in deposit account service charges  a result of internal growth

table of contents net interest and dividend income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income is a function of volume  rates and mix of both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income can be adversely affected by changes in interest rate levels as determined by newmil s gap position  measured by the differences between the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to re pricing within different future time periods

newmil owns all of the common securities of the trust and the trust has no independent assets or operations  and exists for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds in an equivalent amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by newmil 
the junior subordinated debentures  which are the sole assets of the trust  are unsecured obligations of newmil and generally are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all present and future senior and subordinated indebtedness and certain other financial obligations of newmil

table of contents net recovery during the six months ended december  as compared to  annually for fiscal years through due to the large losses and high level of non performing assets through and as of june  the allowance for loan losses at that date was  over the next six years the provision was  less than charge offs 
in  through net charge offs were  and there was no provision for loan losses 
the following table provides a comparison of allowance for loan losses and non performing assets data for and with historical data from    and  which demonstrates the wide range in levels of non performing assets and net charge offs over these periods 
december  june  dollars in thousands loans  net allowance for loan losses non performing assets ratios of allowance to gross loans non performing assets to gross loans although newmil achieved loan growth  before allowance and deferred fees costs  of million  newmil made no provision for loan losses during loan growth was concentrated primarily in family residential mortgages  net charge offs were negligible  and non performing loans remained stable and at a historically low level 
consequently  for the ratio of newmil s allowance for loan losses to total loans declined to at december  from at december   at december  and at june  similarly  for newmil s ratio of non performing loans to total loans continued to remain historically low  and actually declined to at december   compared with at december   at december  and at june  the ratio of past due loans including non performing loans to total loans declined to at december  when compared with at december  the ratio of past due loans was at december  and at june  for additional discussion on loan quality see non performing assets 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the broad categories of the loan portfolio and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans 
although the allowance has been allocated among loan categories for purposes of the table  it is important to recognize that the allowance is applicable to the entire portfolio 
furthermore  charge offs in the future may not necessarily occur in these amounts or proportions

table of contents december  june  june  dollars in thousands allowance loans a allowance loans a allowance loans a real estate mortgages residential to family or more family commercial land land development home equity credit total mortgage loans commercial industrial installment collateral general unallocated total allowance a percent of loans in each category to total loans 
newmil determines its allowance and provisions for loan losses based upon a detailed evaluation of the loan portfolio through a process which considers numerous factors  including estimated credit losses based upon internal and external portfolio reviews  delinquency levels and trends  estimates of the current value of underlying collateral  concentrations  portfolio volume and mix  changes in lending policy  current economic conditions and historical loan loss experience over a to year economic cycle  and examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
determining the level of the allowance at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods  and therefore management takes a relatively long view of loan loss asset quality measures 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information that are often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan portfolio is a continuing event in the light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in management s judgment newmil remains adequately reserved both against total loans and non performing loans at december  the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved by the bank s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the allowance for loan losses is computed by segregating the portfolio into various risk rating and product categories 
some loans have been further segregated and carry specific reserve amounts 
all other loans that do not have specific reserves assigned are reserved based on a loss percentage assigned to the outstanding balance 
the percentage applied to the outstanding balance varies depending on the loan s risk rating and product category  as well as present economic conditions  which have or may adversely affect the financial capacity and or collateral values supporting the loan 
during management refined its distribution process for allocating reserves 
this refinement resulted in an increased distribution of reserves to those portions of the portfolio from that which was previously categorized as general unallocated 
management also determined  based on its review of all components of the bank s loan portfolio  economic data  industry trends and other factors  that the remaining general unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses was adequate at december  in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies could require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination

these commitments can be met in the normal course of business 
newmil believes that its liquidity sources will continue to provide funding sufficient to support operating activities  loan originations and commitments  and deposit withdrawals 
asset liability management and market risk newmil is exposed to interest rate risk  caused by changes in interest rates  affecting its loans  securities  deposits and borrowings 
newmil has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  market risk or equity price risk 
newmil s asset liability committee and investment committee of the board of directors are responsible for the financial management of net interest income  liquidity  capital and other such activities 
the primary objective of newmil s interest rate risk management process is to minimize the volatility to earnings from changes in interest rates 
newmil manages interest rate risk by structuring its balance sheet to attempt to maximize overall profitability  increase revenue  and achieve the desired level of net interest income while managing interest sensitivity risk and liquidity 
newmil manages interest rate risk within limits approved by the board of directors using an earnings simulation model that simulates earnings over a specified time horizon to measure the amount of short term earnings at risk under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
newmil also uses balance sheet gap analysis to measure and monitor its short  medium and long term interest rate positions or exposures 
newmil s earnings simulation analysis incorporates numerous assumptions about balance sheet changes  including growth and product mix  prepayments  product pricing and the behavior of interest rates 
earnings simulation modeling includes assumptions that are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest 
table of contents income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions  and management s strategies  among other factors 
its purpose is to provide management with a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
newmil s policy guideline seeks to ensure that changes in net income over a twelve month horizon under interest rate scenarios that incorporate a and basis point change in the overnight federal funds rate will not exceed and  respectively  as compared with the current overnight federal funds rate scenario 
should earnings simulation amounts deviate by more than these limits  management is required to take remedial action 
newmil tailors its earnings simulation test scenarios to suit current market conditions and interest rate expectations 
because december  interest rates were at historically low levels  newmil performed earnings simulations to test for an immediate and basis point change in interest rates and a gradual basis point change over the twelve month forecast horizon 
based on the results of the december  earnings simulation model  and assuming that management does not take action to alter the outcome  newmil would expect net income over the next twelve months to decrease by if the overnight federal funds decreased immediately by basis points  decrease by if the overnight federal funds increased immediately by basis points  and decrease by if the overnight federal funds increased gradually by basis points over the twelve month forecast horizon 
by comparison  at december   based on the results of the earnings simulation model  and assuming that management did not take action to alter the outcome  newmil expected net income over the next twelve months to increase by if the overnight federal funds decreased immediately by basis points and decrease by if the overnight federal funds increased immediately by basis points 
due to the numerous assumptions in the simulation analysis  actual results will differ from estimated results 
factors other than changes in interest rates could also impact net income 
a significant factor in determining newmil s ability to maintain its net interest margin in a changing interest rate environment is its ability to manage its core deposit rates 
essentially all newmil s deposit base is composed of local retail deposit accounts that tend to be somewhat less sensitive to moderate interest fluctuations than other funding sources and  therefore  provide a reasonably stable and cost effective source of funds 
the entry of new competitors into newmil s market area or renewed disintermediation of deposits fueled by a resurgence in the equities markets may pressure newmil to change its loan and deposit pricing which may negatively affect newmil s net interest margin 
newmil structures its loan and securities portfolios to provide for portfolio re pricing consistent with its interest rate risk objectives 
the following table sets forth newmil s gap position at december   measured in terms of the volume of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities that are subject to re pricing in future time periods 
for the purposes of this analysis  money market and savings deposits have been presented in the within month category and now account deposits have been presented in the after year category  although the interest rate elasticity of money market  savings and now deposits cannot be tied to any one time category 
non accrual loans and overdrafts have been presented in the non interest bearing category 
significant variations may exist in the degree of interest rate sensitivity between individual asset and liability types within the re pricing periods presented due to differences in their re pricing elasticity relative to changes in the general level of interest rates

in january newmil increased its annual dividend to per share 
during the years ended december   and total dividends of  and per share  respectively  were paid 
for the six month period ended december  total dividends of per share were paid 
newmil believes that the payment of cash dividends to its shareholders is appropriate  provided that such payment considers newmil s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition and does not adversely affect the financial stability of newmil or the bank 
the continued payment of cash dividends by newmil will be dependent on newmil s future core earnings  financial condition and capital needs  regulatory restrictions  and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors of newmil 
newmil s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the bank s ability to pay dividends to newmil 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the bank to newmil 
under connecticut law a bank generally is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend on its common stock except from its net profit for the current year and retained net profits for the preceding two years 
consequently  the maximum amount of dividends payable by the bank to newmil at december  was  in some instances  further restrictions on dividends may be imposed on newmil by the frb

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices newmil s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate 
sharp decreases in real estate prices have  in past years  resulted in significant loan losses and losses on real estate acquired 
inflation  or disinflation  could significantly affect newmil s earnings in future periods
