deregulation 
regulatory actions  economic factors and changes in customers and their preferences continue to reshape our gas operations 
a number of customers currently purchase their gas supplies from natural gas marketers and then contract with us for local transportation  balancing and other unbundled services 
in addition  our new york gas distribution companies release firm capacity on our interstate pipeline transportation contracts to natural gas marketers to ensure the marketers gas supply is delivered on a firm basis and in a reliable manner 
as of january   approximately  gas customers on the new york gas distribution system are purchasing their gas from marketers 
however  net gas revenues are not significantly affected by customers opting to purchase their gas supply from other sources since delivery rates charged to transportation customers generally are the same as delivery rates charged to sales service customers

generating facility operations in june  we acquired the  megawatt ravenswood facility located in new york city from consolidated edison company of new york  inc consolidated edison for approximately million 
in order to reduce our initial cash requirements to finance this acquisition  we entered into an arrangement with an unaffiliated variable interest entity through which we lease a portion of the ravenswood facility 
under the arrangement  the variable interest entity acquired a portion of the facility directly from consolidated edison and leased it to our wholly owned subsidiary 
we have guaranteed all payment and performance obligations of our subsidiary under the lease 
the lease master lease relates to approximately million of the acquisition cost of the facility  which is the amount of debt that would have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet had the variable interest entity not been utilized and instead conventional debt financing been employed 
the initial term of the master lease expires on june  and may be extended until june  in june  we have the right to i either purchase the facility for the original acquisition cost of million  plus the present value of the lease payments that would otherwise have been paid through june  ii terminate the master lease and dispose of the facility  or iii otherwise extend the master lease to if the master lease is terminated in  keyspan has guaranteed an amount generally equal to of the residual value of the original cost of the property  plus the present value of the lease payments that would have otherwise been paid through june  keyspan intends to extend the master lease for the forseeable future

the ravenswood facility sells capacity  energy and ancillary services into the new york independent system operator nyiso energy market at market based rates  subject to mitigation 
the plant has the ability to provide approximately of new york city s capacity requirements and is a strategic asset that is available to serve residents and businesses in new york city 
in addition  keyspan intends to enter into a sale leaseback transaction to finance a significant portion of the costs related to the ravenswood expansion project 
for further details on this proposed transaction  see note to the consolidated financial statements subsequent events 
the new york state competitive wholesale market for capacity  energy and ancillary services administered by the nyiso is still evolving and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has adopted several price mitigation measures which are subject to rehearing and possible judicial review 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation regulatory issues and competitive environment for a further discussion of these matters 
forty five of our seventy seven generating units are dual fuel units 
in recent years  we have reconfigured several of our facilities to enable them to burn either natural gas or oil  thus enabling us to switch periodically between fuel alternatives based upon cost and seasonal environmental requirements 
through other innovative technological approaches  we increased installed capacity in our generating facilities by mw  and we instituted a program to reduce nitrogen oxides for improved environmental performance

in january  we filed an application for approval with the new york state siting board on electric generation and environment siting board for a mw combined cycle plant in melville  ny 
in february  the presiding examiners issued a recommended decision recommending that the siting board issue a certificate of environmental capability and public need for the project  and on may  the siting board issued the certificate 
in  we formed a joint venture with american national power  inc anp for the purpose of jointly submitting a proposal in repsonse to a request for proposals by lipa for additional generating resources 
the response proposed the construction of two mw plants  one at the melville site and another at a site in the town of brookhaven in long island which also received a certificate from the siting board 
if successful in negotiating a power purchase agreement with lipa  the anp joint venture will commence construction of the plant 
otherwise  we may seek other opportunities to enter into a long term agreement for the sale of capacity  energy and ancillary services 
in addition  as part of our growth strategy  we continually evaluate the possible acquisition or development of additional generating facilities in the northeast 
however  we are unable to predict when or if such facilities will be acquired or constructed and the effect any such acquired facilities will have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
lipa agreements lipa is a corporate municipal instrumentality and a political subdivision of the state of new york 
on may   certain of lilco s business units were merged with keyspan and lilco s common stock and remaining assets were acquired by lipa 
at the time of this transaction  three major long term service agreements were also executed between keyspan and lipa collectively  the lipa agreements 
under the agreements and subsequent power purchase agreements  keyspan provides  mw of power generation capacity and energy conversion services  operation  maintenance and capital improvement services for lipa s transmission and distribution system  and energy management services 
power supply agreement 
a keyspan subsidiary sells to lipa all of the capacity and  to the extent requested  energy conversion services from our existing long island based oil and gas fired generating plants 
sales of capacity and energy conversion services are made under rates approved by ferc 
under the terms of the psa  rates will be reestablished for the contract year commencing january  by recalculating the revenue requirement underlying those rates 
a rate filing reflecting the recalculated revenue requirement was submitted to ferc on october  and on december   ferc issued an order accepting  in part  the rates subject to refund pending settlement discussions and hearings 
we are unable to predict the outcome of those proceedings at this time 
rates charged to lipa include a fixed and variable component 
the variable component is billed to lipa on a monthly basis and is dependent on the number of megawatt hours dispatched 
lipa has no obligation to purchase energy conversion services from us and is able to purchase energy or energy conversion services on a least cost basis from all available sources consistent with existing interconnection limitations of the t d system 
the psa provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for the maintenance of the output capability and the efficiency of the generating facilities 
in  we earned million in incentives under the psa 
the psa runs for a term of years 
the psa is renewable for an additional years on similar terms at lipa s option 
however  the psa provides lipa the option of electing to reduce or ramp down the capacity it purchases from us in accordance with agreed upon schedules 
in years through of the psa  if lipa elects to ramp down  we are entitled to receive payment for of the present value of the capacity charges otherwise payable over the remaining term of the psa 
if lipa ramps down the generation capacity in years through of the psa  the capacity charges otherwise payable by lipa will be reduced in accordance with a formula established in the psa 
if lipa exercises its ramp down option  keyspan may use any capacity released by lipa to bid on new lipa capacity requirements or to replace other ramped down capacity 
if we continue to operate the ramped down capacity  the psa requires us to use reasonable efforts to market the capacity and energy from the ramped down capacity and to share any profits with lipa 
the psa will be terminated in the event that lipa exercises its right to purchase  at fair market value  all of the long island generating facilities pursuant to the generation purchase rights agreement discussed in greater detail below 
we also have an inventory of sulfur dioxide so and nitrogen oxide nox emission allowances that may be sold to third party purchasers 
the amount of allowances varies from year to year relative to the level of emissions from the long island generating facilities  which is greatly dependent on the mix of natural gas and fuel oil used for generation and the amount of purchased power that is imported onto long island 
in accordance with the psa  of emission allowance sales revenues attributable to the long island generating facilities is retained by keyspan and the other is credited to lipa 
lipa also has a right of first refusal on any potential emission allowance sales of the long island generating facilities 
additionally  keyspan voluntarily entered into a memorandum of understanding with the new york state department of environmental conservation dec  which memorandum prohibits the sale of so allowances into certain states and requires the purchaser to be bound by the same restriction  which may marginally affect the market value of the allowances 
management services agreement 
under the msa  we perform day to day operation and maintenance services and capital improvements for lipa s transmission and distribution system  including  among other functions  transmission and distribution facility operations  customer service  billing and collection  meter reading  planning  engineering  and construction  all in accordance with policies and procedures adopted by lipa

in exchange for providing these services  we are reimbursed for our budgeted costs and entitled to earn an annual management fee of million and may also earn certain cost based incentives  or be responsible for certain cost based penalties 
the incentives provide for us to retain of the first million of budget underruns and of any additional budget underruns up to of the total cost budget 
thereafter  all savings accrue to lipa 
the penalties require us to absorb any total cost budget overruns up to a maximum of million in any contract year 
in addition to the foregoing cost based incentives and penalties  we are eligible for performance based incentives for performance above certain threshold target levels and subject to disincentives for performance below certain other threshold levels  with an intermediate band of performance in which neither incentives nor disincentives will apply  for system reliability  worker safety  and customer satisfaction 
in  we earned million in non cost performance incentives 
the msa was originally set to expire on may   but was extended through december  the msa was extended in exchange for an extension of the option period under the generation purchase rights agreement as more fully described in the discussion on generation purchase rights agreement below 
energy management agreement 
pursuant to the ema  keyspan i procures and manages fuel supplies for lipa to fuel our long island generating facilities acquired from lilco in  ii performs off system capacity and energy purchases on a least cost basis to meet lipa s needs  and iii makes off system sales of output from the long island generating facilities and other power supplies either owned or under contract to lipa 
lipa is entitled to two thirds of the profit from any off system electricity sales arranged by us 
the term for the fuel supply service provided in i above is fifteen years  expiring may   and the term for the off system purchases and sales services provided in ii and iii above is eight years  expiring may  in exchange for these services  we earn an annual fee of million  plus an allowance for certain costs incurred in performing services under the ema 
the ema further provides incentives and disincentives up to million annually for control of the cost of fuel and electricity purchased on behalf of lipa 
in  we earned ema incentives in an aggregate of million 
generation purchase rights agreement 
under the generation purchase rights agreement gpra  lipa had the right for a one year period  beginning may   to acquire all of our long island based generating assets formerly owned by lilco at fair market value at the time of the exercise of such right 
by agreement dated march   lipa and keyspan amended the gpra to provide for a new six month option period ending on may  the other terms of the option reflected in the gpra remain unchanged 
the gpra and msa extensions were the result of an initiative established by lipa to work with keyspan and others to review long island s long term energy needs 
we will work with lipa to jointly analyze new energy supply options including re powering existing plants  renewable energy technologies  distributed generation  conservation initiatives and retail competition 
the extension also allows both lipa and us to explore alternatives to the gpra including the sale of some of our currently existing long island generation plants to lipa  or the sale of some or all of these plants to other private operators 
other rights 
pursuant to other agreements between lipa and us  certain future rights have been granted to lipa 
subject to certain conditions  these rights include the right for years to lease or purchase  at fair market value  parcels of land and to acquire unlimited access to  as well as appropriate easements at  the long island generating facilities for the purpose of constructing new electric generating facilities to be owned by lipa or its designee 
subject to this right granted to lipa  keyspan has the right to sell or lease property on or adjoining the long island generating facilities to third parties 
in addition  lipa has acquired a parcel of land at the site of the former shoreham nuclear power station site for the terminus of a transmission cable under long island sound and other generating facilities 
we own the common plant such as administrative office buildings and computer systems formerly owned by lilco and recover an allocable share of the carrying costs of such plant through the msa 
keyspan has agreed to provide lipa  for a period of years  the right to enter into leases at fair market value for common plant or sub contract for common services which it may assign to a subsequent manager of the transmission and distribution system 
we have also agreed i for a period of years not to compete with lipa as a provider of transmission or distribution service on long island  ii that lipa will share in synergy ie  efficiency savings over a year period attributed to the may  transaction which resulted in the formation of keyspan estimated to be approximately billion  which savings are incorporated into the cost structure under the lipa agreements  and iii generally not to commence any tax certiorari case until termination of the psa challenging certain property tax assessments relating to the former lilco long island generating facilities 
guarantees and indemnities 
we have entered into agreements with lipa to provide for the guarantee of certain obligations  indemnification against certain liabilities and allocation of responsibility and liability for certain pre existing obligations and liabilities 
in general  liabilities associated with the lilco assets transferred to keyspan  have been assumed by keyspan  and liabilities associated with the assets acquired by lipa  are borne by lipa  subject to certain specified exceptions 
we have assumed all liabilities arising from all manufactured gas plant mgp operations of lilco and its predecessors  and lipa has assumed certain liabilities relating to the former lilco long island generating facilities and all liabilities traceable to the business and operations conducted by lipa after completion of the keyspan lilco transaction 
an agreement also provides for an allocation of liabilities which relates to the assets that were common to the operations of lilco and or shared services and are not traceable directly to either the business or operations conducted by lipa or keyspan 
in addition  costs incurred by keyspan for liabilities for asbestos exposure arising from the activities of the generating facilities previously owned by lilco are recoverable from lipa through the power supply agreement between lipa and keyspan

energy services overview the energy services segment includes companies that provide energy related services to customers primarily located within the new york city metropolitan area including new jersey and connecticut  as well as rhode island  pennsylvania  massachusetts and new hampshire through the following two lines of business i home energy services  which provides residential customers with installation  service and maintenance of energy systems and appliances  as well as the retail marketing of electricity to commercial customers  and ii business solutions  which provides plumbing  heating  ventilation  air conditioning and mechanical services  as well as operation and maintenance  design  engineering and consulting services to commercial and industrial customers 
on may   keyspan s gas and electric marketing subsidiary  keyspan energy services  assigned a substantial portion of its retail natural gas customers  consisting mostly of residential and small commercial customers  to econnergy energy co  inc econnergy 
econnergy is one of the largest deregulated energy service companies in the northeast 
keyspan energy services is continuing its electric marketing activities 
the energy services segment has more than  employees and  service contracts  and is the number one oil to gas conversion contractor in new york and new england 
keyspan s energy services subsidiaries compete with local  regional and national mechanical contracting  hvac  plumbing  engineering  and independent energy companies  in addition to electric utilities  independent power producers and local distribution companies 
competition is based largely upon pricing  availability and reliability of supply  technical and financial capabilities  regional presence  experience and customer service 
in  we discontinued the general contracting activities related to the former roy kay companies with the exception of work to be completed on existing contracts  based upon our view that the general contracting business was not a core competency of these companies 
as a result of our evaluation of the energy services business undertaken during  we decided to set certain limitations on the types of new general contracting activities in which our contracting subsidiaries may engage 
we also installed senior management personnel who  among other things  have reviewed and continue to review and focus on our overall strategy of these businesses 
for additional information concerning the energy services segment  see the discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations energy services contained herein 
energy investments overview we are also engaged in energy investments which include i gas exploration and production activities  ii domestic pipelines and gas storage facilities  iii midstream natural gas processing activities in canada  iv natural gas pipeline activities in the united kingdom  and v certain other domestic energy related investments  such as the transportation by truck of liquid natural gas and new fuel cell technologies 
gas exploration and production keyspan is engaged in the exploration for and production of domestic natural gas and oil through our equity interest in the houston exploration company houston exploration and through our wholly owned subsidiary  keyspan exploration and production  llc keyspan exploration 
houston exploration was organized by kedny in to conduct natural gas and oil exploration and production activities 
it completed an initial public offering in and its shares are currently traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol thx 
on february   houston exploration issued million shares of its common stock  the net proceeds of which were used to repurchase million shares of common stock owned by us 
as a result of the repurchase  our ownership interest in houston exploration was reduced from approximately to the current level of approximately 
this reduction in our ownership interest is in line with our strategy of monetizing or divesting certain non core assets  which include investment in oil and gas exploration and production assets 
at march   houston exploration s aggregate market capitalization was approximately billion based upon the closing price on the new york stock exchange on march  of per share 
at march   houston exploration had approximately  shares of common stock  par value  outstanding 
keyspan exploration is engaged in a joint venture with houston exploration to explore for natural gas and oil 
houston exploration contributed all of its undeveloped offshore leases to the joint venture for a working interest and keyspan exploration acquired a working interest in all prospects to be drilled by the joint venture 
effective  the joint venture was modified to reflect that keyspan exploration would only participate in the development of wells that had previously been drilled and not participate in future exploration prospects 
in line with our stated strategy of exploring the monetization or divestiture of certain non core assets  in october  we sold a portion of our assets in the joint venture drilling program to houston exploration 
our gas exploration and production subsidiaries focus their operations offshore in the gulf of mexico and onshore in south texas  south louisiana  the arkoma basin  east texas and west virginia 
the geographic focus of these operations enables our subsidiaries to manage a comparatively large asset base with relatively few employees and to add and operate production at relatively low incremental costs 
our gas exploration and production subsidiaries seek to balance their offshore and onshore activities so that the lower risk and more stable production typically associated with onshore properties complement the high potential exploratory projects in the gulf of mexico by balancing risk and reducing volatility 
houston exploration s business strategy is to seek to continue to increase reserves  production and cash flow by pursuing internally generated prospects  primarily in the gulf of mexico  by conducting development and exploratory drilling on our offshore and onshore properties and by making selective opportune acquisitions 
offshore properties 
our interests in offshore properties are located in the shallow waters of the outer continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
our interests in key producing properties are located in the western and central gulf of mexico and include the mustang island  high island  east cameron  vermilion and south timbalier areas 
we hold interests in blocks in federal and state waters  of which are developed 
through our subsidiaries  we operate of our developed blocks  which accounted for approximately of our interests in offshore production during we have a total of platforms and production caissons of which we operate since its inception in  the joint venture participated in wells  of which were successful exploratory and six development 
during  we drilled ten offshore wells  nine of which were successful  representing a success rate of 
of the successful wells drilled  six were exploratory and three were development 
the joint venture participated in four of the wells  two exploratory and two development  all of which were successful 
onshore properties 
our interests in south texas properties are concentrated in the charco  haynes and south trevino fields of zapata county  the alexander  hubbard and south laredo fields of webb county  and the north east thompsonville field in jim hogg county 
we own interests in producing wells  of which are operated by our subsidiaries 
our interests in arkoma basin properties are located in two primary areas the chismville massard field located in logan and sebastian counties of arkansas and the wilburton and panola fields located in latimer county  oklahoma 
we own working interests in producing natural gas wells  of which we operate other onshore properties are concentrated in three areas south louisiana  west virginia and east texas 
on a combined basis  we own working interests in producing wells  of which we operate 
during  we drilled onshore wells  of which were successful  representing a success rate of 
of the successful wells drilled  were drilled in south texas and were drilled in the arkoma basin 
of the successful wells drilled  were development and two were exploratory

domestic pipelines and gas storage facilities we also own an approximate interest in iroquois gas transmission system lp  the partnership that owns a mile pipeline that currently transports mdth of canadian gas supply daily from the new york canadian border to markets in the northeastern united states 
keyspan is also a shipper on iroquois and currently transports up to mdth of gas per day 
we are also participating in the islander east pipeline company llc islander east  an interstate pipeline joint venture with duke energy corporation 
the joint venture involves the construction  ownership and operation of a mile natural gas pipeline that will transport mdth of gas supply daily from nova scotia  canada to growing markets in connecticut  new york city and long island  new york 
increasing gas transmission capacity is necessary to meet the increased demand for natural gas in the northeast  which coincides with the growth strategy of our gas distribution business 
applications for all necessary regulatory authorizations were filed in and to date  islander east has received a final certificate from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and all necessary permits from the state of new york 
however  the state of connecticut has denied islander east s application for a coastal zone management permit and a permit under section of the clean water act 
islander east has reinstated its appeal of the state of connecticut s determination on the coastal zone management issue to the united states department of commerce and is evaluating its legal and other options with respect to the section issue 
once in service  the pipeline is expected to transport up to  dth daily to the long island and new york city energy markets  enough natural gas to heat  homes 
the pipeline will also allow keyspan to diversify the geographic sources of its gas supply 
however  we are unable to predict when or if all regulatory approvals required to construct this pipeline will be obtained 
various options for the financing of pipeline construction are currently being evaluated 
at december   total expenditures associated with the siting and permitting of the islander east pipeline were million 
we also have equity investments in two gas storage facilities in the state of new york honeoye storage corporation and steuben gas storage company 
we own a interest in honeoye  an underground gas storage facility which provides up to billion cubic feet of storage service to new york and new england 
additionally  we own of a partnership that has a interest in the steuben facility that provides up to billion cubic feet of storage service to new jersey and massachusetts 
on december   we acquired algonquin lng  lp  the owner and operator of a  barrel liquefied natural gas lng storage and receiving facility located in providence  rhode island  from duke energy 
boston gas company is the facility s largest customer and contracts for more than half of its storage 
the facility  renamed keyspan lng  lp  is regulated by ferc 
in a joint initiative with bg lng services  keyspan plans to upgrade the keyspan lng facility to accept marine deliverables and to triple vaporization or regasification capacity 
pending regulatory approvals  the facility could be ready to accept marine deliverables by late our investments in domestic pipelines and gas storage facilities are complimentary to our gas distribution and electric services businesses in that they provide energy infrastructure to support the growth of these businesses and  therefore  we will continue to pursue these opportunities 
midstream natural gas processing activities in canada during the year  we sold of our interest in keyspan canada  a company with natural gas processing plants and gathering facilities located in western canada 
in february  we entered into an agreement to sell an additional of our interest in keyspan canada 
following the closing of this additional sale of our interest  currently scheduled for early april  we will own of keyspan canada 
the assets include interests in processing plants and associated gathering systems that can process approximately bcfe of natural gas daily  and provide associated natural gas liquids fractionation 
additionally  we sold our interest in taylor ngl lp that owns and operates two extraction plants also in canada  one located in british columbia  and one in alberta  canada 
we consider our canadian operations to be non core assets and we continue to evaluate strategies to divest or monetize these assets 
natural gas distribution and pipeline activities in the united kingdom we own a interest in premier transmission limited  an mile pipeline to northern ireland from southwest scotland that has planned transportation capacity of approximately mdth of gas supply daily to markets in northern ireland 
keyspan considers this a non core asset and is evaluating the possible divestiture or monetization 
in december   the company sold its interest in phoenix natural gas limited  a gas distribution system serving the city of belfast  northern ireland

these requirements govern both our normal  ongoing operations and the remediation of impacted properties historically used in utility operations 
potential liability associated with our historical operations may be imposed without regard to fault  even if the activities were lawful at the time they occurred 
except as set forth below  or in note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations and contingencies environmental matters  no material proceedings relating to environmental matters have been commenced or  to our knowledge  are contemplated by any federal  state or local agency against keyspan  and we are not a defendant in any material litigation with respect to any matter relating to the protection of the environment 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and that requirements imposed by existing environmental laws are not likely to have a material adverse impact upon us 
we are also pursuing claims against insurance carriers and potentially responsible parties which seek the recovery of certain environmental costs associated with the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties 
we believe that investigation and remediation costs prudently incurred at facilities associated with utility operations  not recoverable through insurance or some other means  will be recoverable from our customers in accordance with the terms of our rate recovery agreements for each regulated subsidiary 
air 
the federal clean air act caa provides for the regulation of a variety of air emissions from new and existing electric generating plants 
final permits in accordance with the requirements of title v of the amendments to the caa have been issued for all of our electric generating facilities  with the exception of two mw simple cycle gas turbine units which were constructed in these units currently are permitted under new york state facility permits and title v permits have been timely applied for and are pending issuance by the nysdec 
renewal applications have been submitted in a timely manner for existing facilities whose initial permits will expire in the permits and timely renewal applications allow our electric generating plants to continue to operate without any additional significant expenditures  except as described below 
our generating facilities are located within a caa severe ozone non attainment area  and are subject to phase i  ii  and iii nox reduction requirements established under the ozone transport commission otc memorandum of understanding 
our investments in boiler combustion modifications and the use of natural gas firing systems at our steam electric generating stations have enabled us to achieve the emission reductions required under phase i  ii  and iii of the otc memorandum in a cost effective manner 
we have achieved and expect to continue to achieve such emission reductions in a cost effective manner through the use of low nox combustion control systems  the use of natural gas fuel and or the purchases of allowances when necessary 
capital expenditures were incurred between million and million for combustion control systems and natural gas fuel capability additions over the last several years enhance compliance options 
in  new york state promulgated regulations which will establish separate nox and so emission reduction requirements on electric generating facilities in new york state beginning in late keyspan s facilities are expected to comply with the nox requirements without material additional expenditures because of previously installed emissions control equipment 
so compliance is expected to require a reduction in the sulfur content of the fuel oil used in our northport and port jefferson facilities 
based on current projections  higher incremental fuel costs at these facilities will be approximately million per year  and  contractually  are the obligation of lipa in accordance with the terms of the ppa 
in december  the united states environmental protection agency usepa issued draft regulations that would require reductions of mercury and nickel as well as further reductions of nox and so from electric generating facilities on a national basis 
the proposed mercury regulations would have no impact on keyspan facilities since their application is limited to coal fired plants 
the proposed nickel  nox and so reduction requirements  if finalized as drafted  could require additional expenditures for emission control systems or greater use of natural gas in order to facilitate compliance 
until these regulations are finalized  the nature and extent of the financial impact on keyspan  if any  cannot be determined 
in  the governor of new york initiated a regional greenhouse gas initiative that seeks to establish a coordinated multistate plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions primarily carbon dioxide from electric generating emission sources in the northeast 
several congressional initiatives are also under consideration that may also require greenhouse gas reductions from electric generating facilities nationwide 
at the present time  it is not possible to predict the nature of the requirements  which ultimately will be imposed on keyspan nor what  if any  financial impact such requirements would have on keyspan facilities 
however  our investments in emissions control technology and conversions to natural gas capability have resulted in a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions over the last decade  while the electric generation industry as a whole increased carbon dioxide emissions by 
the addition of the efficient  combined cycle unit at ravenswood will further reduce emission rates when it commences commercial operations in water 
the federal clean water act provides for effluent limitations  to be implemented by a permit system  to regulate the discharge of pollutants into united states waters 
we possess permits for our generating units which authorize discharges from cooling water circulating systems and chemical treatment systems 
these permits are renewed from time to time  as required by regulation 
additional capital expenditures associated with the renewal of the surface water discharge permits for our power plants may be required by the dec 
we are currently monitoring impacts of our discharges on aquatic resources  in consultation with the dec 
until our monitoring obligations are completed and proposed changes to the environmental protection agency regulations under section of the clean water act are finalized  the nature and cost of equipment upgrades cannot be determined 
land 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of and certain similar state laws collectively superfund impose liability  regardless of fault  upon generators of hazardous substances even before superfund was enacted for costs associated with remediating contaminated property 
in the course of our business operations  we generate materials which  after disposal  may become subject to superfund 
from time to time  we have received notices under superfund concerning possible claims with respect to sites where hazardous substances generated by keyspan or its predecessors and other potentially responsible parties were allegedly disposed 
normally the costs associated with such claims are allocated among the potentially responsible parties on a pro rata basis 
the cost of these claims is not presently determinable 
superfund does  however  provide for joint and several liability against a single potentially responsible party 
in the unlikely event that superfund claims were pursued against us on that basis  the costs  may be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
keyspan has identified certain manufactured gas plant mgp sites which were historically owned or operated by its subsidiaries or such companies predecessors 
operations at these sites between the mid s to mid s may have resulted in the release of hazardous substances 
for a discussion on our mgp sites and further information concerning environmental matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations and contingencies environmental matters 
competition  regulation and rate matters competition 
over the last several years  the natural gas and electric industries have undergone significant change as market forces moved towards replacing or supplementing rate regulation through the introduction of competition 
a significant number of natural gas and electric utilities reacted to the changing structure of the energy industry by entering into business combinations  with the goal of reducing common costs  gaining size to better withstand competitive pressures and business cycles  and attaining synergies from the combination of operations 
we engaged in two such combinations  the keyspan lilco transaction in and our november acquisition of eastern and energynorth 
for further information regarding the gas and electric industry  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation regulatory issues and competitive environment 
ravenswood  the merchant plant in our electric services segment  is subject to competitive and other risks that could adversely impact the market price for the plant s output 
such risks include  but are not limited to  the construction of new generation or transmission capacity serving the new york city market 
however  we cannot predict when or if new generation or transmission capacity will be built 
additionally  our non utility subsidiaries engaged in the energy services business compete with other mechanical  hvac  and engineering companies  and in new jersey are faced with competition from the regulated utilities that are still able to offer appliance repair and protection services 
regulation 
public utility holding companies  like keyspan  are regulated by the sec under puhca and to some extent by state utility commissions through the regulation of corporate  financial and affiliate activities of public utilities 
our utility subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation by state utility commissions  ferc and the sec 
our gas and electric public utility companies are subject to either or both state and federal regulation 
in general  state public utility commissions  such as the new york public service commission nypsc  the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte and the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc regulate the provision of retail services  including the distribution and sale of natural gas and electricity to consumers 
each of the federal and state regulators also regulates certain transactions among our affiliates 
ferc regulates interstate natural gas transportation and electric transmission  and has jurisdiction over certain wholesale natural gas sales and wholesale electric sales 
in addition  our non utility subsidiaries are subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations with respect to their business activities  including but not limited to those affecting public sector projects  environmental and labor laws and regulations  state licensing requirements  as well as state laws and regulations concerning the competitive retail commodity supply 
state utility commissions 
our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the nypsc  dte and nhpuc 
the nypsc regulates kedny and kedli 
although keyspan corporation is not regulated by the nypsc  it is impacted by conditions that were included in the nypsc order authorizing the keyspan lilco transaction 
those conditions address  among other things  the manner in which keyspan  its service company subsidiaries and its unregulated subsidiaries may interact with kedny and kedli 
the nypsc also regulates the safety  reliability and certain financial transactions of our long island generating facilities and our ravenswood generating facility under a lightened regulatory standard 
our kedne subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the dte and nhpuc 
our energy services subsidiaries which engage in the retail sale of electricity are also subject to regulation by the nypsc 
for further information regarding the state regulatory commissions  see the discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulation and rate matters 
federal energy regulatory commission 
ferc regulates the sale of electricity at wholesale and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce as well as certain corporate and financial activities of companies that are engaged in such activities 
the long island generating facilities and the ravenswood facility are subject to ferc regulation based on their wholesale energy transactions 
in  lipa  keyspan and the staff of ferc stipulated to a five year rate plan for the long island generating facilities with agreed upon yearly adjustments  which have been approved by ferc 
a rate filing reflecting a recalculated revenue requirement was submitted to ferc on october  on december   ferc issued an order accepting  in part  the rates subject to refund pending settlement discussions and hearings 
we are unable to predict the outcome of those proceedings at this time 
our ravenswood facility s rates are based on a market based rate application approved by ferc 
the rates that our ravenswood facility may charge are subject to mitigation measures due to market power concerns of ferc 
the mitigation measures are administered by the nyiso 
ferc retains the ability in future proceedings  either on its own motion or upon a complaint filed with ferc  to modify the ravenswood facility s rates  as well as the mitigation measures  if ferc concludes that it is in the public interest to do so 
keyspan currently offers and sells the energy  capacity and ancillary services from the ravenswood facility through the energy market operated by the nyiso 
for information concerning the nyiso  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation regulatory issues and competitive environment 
ferc also has jurisdiction to regulate certain natural gas sales for resale in interstate commerce  the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and  unless an exemption applies  companies engaged in such activities 
the natural gas distribution activities of kedny  kedli  kedne and certain related intrastate gas transportation functions are not subject to ferc jurisdiction 
however  to the extent that kedny  kedli or kedne purchase or sell gas for resale in interstate commerce  such transactions are subject to ferc jurisdiction and have been authorized by ferc 
our interests in iroquois  honeoye  steuben and keyspan lng are also fully regulated by ferc as natural gas companies 
securities and exchange commission 
as a result of the acquisition of eastern and energynorth  we became a registered holding company under puhca 
therefore  our corporate and financial activities and those of our subsidiaries  including their ability to pay dividends to us  are subject to regulation by the sec 
under our holding company structure  we have no independent operations or source of income of our own and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and  as a result  we depend on the earnings and cash flow of  and dividends or distributions from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt and contractual obligations and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our consolidated assets  earnings and cash flow is derived from the operations of our regulated utility subsidiaries  whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities 
for additional information concerning regulation by the sec under puhca  see the discussion under the heading securities and exchange commission regulation contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein 
in addition  in november  keyspan received authorization from the sec to operate three mutual service companies 
under this order  the sec determined that  in accordance with puhca  keyspan corporate services llc kcs  keyspan utility services llc kus and keyspan engineering survey  inc keng may operate to provide various services to keyspan subsidiaries  including regulated utility companies  at cost fairly and equitably allocated among them 
foreign regulation 
keyspan s foreign operations in northern ireland  conducted through premier  are subject to licensing by the northern ireland department of economic development and regulation by the uk department of trade and industry with respect to the subsea and on land portions of the premier pipeline and the northern ireland director general  office for the regulation of electricity and gas with respect to the northern ireland portion of the premier pipeline 
the licenses establish mechanisms for the establishment of rates for the conveyance and transportation of natural gas  and generally may not be revoked except upon long term notice 
keyspan s assets in canada are subject to regulation by canadian federal and provincial authorities 
such regulatory authorities license various aspects of the facilities and pipeline systems as well as regulate safety  operational and environmental matters and certain changes in such facilities and pipelines capacities and operations 
risks related to our business we are a holding company  and we and our subsidiaries are subject to federal and or state regulation which limits our financial activities  including the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions to us we are a holding company registered under puhca with no business operations or sources of income of our own 
we conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries and depend on the earnings and cash flow of  and dividends or distributions from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt and contractual obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock 
because we are a registered holding company  our corporate and financial activities and those of our subsidiaries  including their ability to pay dividends to us from unearned surplus  are subject to puhca and regulation by the sec 
in addition  a substantial portion of our consolidated assets  earnings and cash flow is derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries  whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation by the utility regulatory commissions of new york  massachusetts and new hampshire 
pursuant to nypsc orders  the ability of kedny and kedli to pay dividends to us is conditioned upon their maintenance of a utility capital structure with debt not exceeding and  respectively  of total utility capitalization 
in addition  the level of dividends paid by both utilities may not be increased from current levels if a basis point penalty is incurred under a customer service performance program 
at the end of kedny s and kedli s rate years september  and november   respectively  their ratios of debt to total utility capitalization were well in compliance with the ratios set forth above 
puhca also limits our business operations and our ability to affiliate with other utilities in addition to limiting our financial activities  puhca also limits our operations to a single integrated utility system  plus additional energy related businesses  regulates transactions between us and our subsidiaries and requires sec approval for specified utility mergers and acquisitions 
in april  the sec determined that the companies that comprise our energy services business are energy related companies and therefore retainable under existing sec precedent 
however  the sec also required that certain of those companies increase the percentage of their work that is energy related 
our gas distribution and electric services businesses may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state regulation the regulatory environment applicable to our gas distribution and our electric services businesses has undergone substantial changes in recent years  on both the federal and state levels 
these changes have significantly affected the nature of the gas and electric utility and power industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses 
moreover  existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities and future changes in laws and regulations may affect our gas distribution and our electric services businesses in ways that we cannot predict 
in addition  our operations are subject to extensive government regulation and require numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state and local governmental agencies 
a significant portion of our revenues in our gas distribution and electric services segments are directly dependent on rates established by federal or state regulatory authorities  and any change in these rates and regulatory structure could significantly impact our financial results 
increases in utility costs other than gas  not otherwise offset by increases in revenues or reductions in other expenses  could have an adverse effect on earnings due to the time lag associated with obtaining regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses in rates  and the uncertainty of whether regulatory commissions will allow full recovery of and return on such increased costs and expenses 
various rulemaking proposals and market design revisions related to the wholesale power market are being reviewed at the federal level 
these proposals  as well as legislative and other attention to the electric power industry could have a material adverse effect on our strategies and results of operations for our electric services business and our financial condition 
in particular  we sell power and energy from our ravenswood generating facility into the new york independent system operator  or nyiso  energy market at market based rates  subject to mitigation measures approved by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc 
the pricing for both energy sales and services to the nyiso energy market is still evolving and some of ferc s price mitigation measures are subject to rehearing and possible judicial review 
our risk mitigation techniques such as hedging and purchase of insurance may not adequately provide protection to mitigate our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  keyspan routinely enters into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments  weather fluctuations  electricity sales  natural gas supply and other commodities 
however  we do not always cover the entire exposure of our assets or our positions to market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time 
to the extent we have unhedged positions or our hedging procedures do not work as planned  fluctuating commodity prices could cause our sales and net income to be volatile 
in addition  our business is subject to many hazards from which our insurance may not adequately provide coverage 
an unexpected outage of ravenswood  especially in the significant summer period  could materially impact our financial results 
damage to pipelines  equipment  properties and people caused by natural disasters  accidents  terrorism or other damage by third parties could exceed our insurance coverage 
although we do have insurance to protect against many of these contingent liabilities  this insurance is capped at certain levels  has self insured retentions and does not provide coverage for all liabilities 
sec rules for exploration and production companies may require us to recognize a non cash impairment charge at the end of our reporting periods we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in natural gas and oil properties 
these investments consist of our approximately equity interest in the houston exploration company and our ownership of keyspan exploration 
under the full cost method  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of natural gas and oil reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool as incurred  and properties in the pool are depleted and charged to operations using the unit of production method based on production and proved reserve quantities 
to the extent that these capitalized costs  net of accumulated depletion  less deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  those excess costs are charged to operations 
if a write down is required  it would result in a charge to earnings but would not have an impact on cash flows 
once incurred  an impairment of gas properties is not reversible at a later date  even if gas prices increase 
our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis our gas distribution business is a seasonal business and is subject to weather conditions 
we receive most of our gas distribution revenues in the first and fourth quarters  when demand for natural gas increases due to colder weather conditions 
as a result  we are subject to seasonal variations in working capital because we purchase natural gas supplies for storage in the second and third quarters and must finance these purchases 
accordingly  our results of operations in the future will fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
in addition  our new england based gas distribution subsidiaries do not benefit from weather normalization tariffs  and results from our ravenswood generating facility are directly correlated to the weather as the demand and price for the electricity it generates increases during extreme temperature conditions 
as a result  fluctuations in weather between years may have a significant effect on our results of operations for these subsidiaries 
the construction activities of our energy services subsidiaries are also affected by weather 
we cannot predict whether lipa will exercise its option to purchase our long island generating assets and the effect of that purchase on us under the gpra  lipa has the right to purchase  at fair market value  during the six month period beginning november   all of our long island based generating assets that had been previously owned by the long island lighting company all long island units except for the mw facility at port jefferson and the mw facility in glenwood 
at this point in time  we cannot predict whether lipa will exercise its right to purchase the assets  nor can we estimate the effect on our financial condition or results of operations if lipa were to exercise its option 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from our agreements with lipa  and no assurance can be made that these arrangements will be renewed at the end of their terms or that the resolution of certain disputes will not materially impact the financial condition of the company we derive a substantial portion of our revenues in our electric services segment from a number of agreements with lipa pursuant to which we manage lipa s transmission and distribution system and supply the majority of lipa s customers electricity needs 
the agreements terminate at various dates between may  and may   and at this time  we can provide no assurance that any of the agreements will be renewed or extended  or if they were to be renewed or extended  the terms and conditions thereof 
in addition  given the complexity of these arrangements  disputes arise from time to time between the company and lipa concerning the rights and obligations of each party to make and receive payments as required pursuant to the terms of these agreements 
as a result  the company is unable to determine what effect  if any  the ultimate resolution of these disputes will have on its financial condition or results of operations 
we own approximately of houston exploration and our results of operation are therefore subject to the risks affecting its business we own approximately of houston exploration 
therefore  our results of operations in our energy investments segment are subject to the same risks and uncertainties that affect the operations of houston exploration 
in addition to the risks set forth under the caption sec rules for exploration and production companies may require us to recognize a non cash impairment charge at the end of our reporting periods  these risks and uncertainties include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices 
if natural gas and oil prices decline  the amount of natural gas and oil houston exploration can economically produce may be reduced  which may result in a material decline in its revenue 
the potential inability of houston exploration to meet its capital requirements 
if houston exploration is unable to meet its capital requirements to fund  develop  acquire and produce natural gas and oil reserves  its oil and gas reserves will decline 
substantial indebtedness 
houston exploration s outstanding indebtedness under its bank credit facility and the indenture governing its senior subordinated notes contain covenants that require a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to be dedicated to its debt service obligations and impose other restrictions that limit its ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets 
these restrictions may affect its flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions 
estimates of proved reserves and future net revenue may change 
any significant variance from the assumptions used to estimate proved reserves or natural gas could result in the actual quantity of houston exploration s reserves and future net cash flow being materially different from the estimates in its reserve report 
a decline or an otherwise negative change in the ratings or outlook on our securities could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to secure additional financing on favorable terms the credit rating agencies that rate our debt securities regularly review our financial condition and results of operations 
we can provide no assurances that the ratings or outlook on our debt securities will not be reduced or otherwise negatively changed 
a negative change in the ratings or outlook on our debt securities could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to secure additional financing on favorable terms 
our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant  and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could adversely affect us our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources and the health and safety of our employees 
these environmental laws and regulations expose us to costs and liabilities relating to our operations and our current and formerly owned properties 
compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring  installation of pollution control equipment and permits at our facilities 
costs of compliance with environmental regulations  and in particular emission regulations  could have a material impact on our electric services business and our results of operations and financial position  especially if emission limits are tightened  more extensive permitting requirements are imposed  additional substances become regulated or the number and type of electric generating plants we operate increase 
in addition  we are responsible for the clean up of contamination at certain manufactured gas plant mgp sites and at other sites and are aware of additional mgp sites where we may have responsibility for clean up costs 
while our gas utility subsidiaries rate plans generally allow for the full recovery of the costs of investigation and remediation of most of our mgp sites  these rate recovery mechanisms may change in the future 
to the extent rate recovery mechanisms change in the future  or if additional environmental matters arise in the future at our currently or historically owned facilities  at sites we may acquire in the future or at third party waste disposal sites  costs associated with investigating and remediating these sites could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our businesses are subject to competition and general economic conditions impacting demand for services ravenswood  our merchant generation plant  in our electric services segment  is subject to competition that could adversely impact the market price for the electricity it produces 
construction of new transmission facilities could also cause significant changes to the market 
if generation and or transmission facilities are constructed  and or the availability of our ravenswood facility deteriorates  then the capacity and energy sales quantities could be adversely affected 
we cannot predict  however  when or if new power plants or transmission facilities will be built or the nature of the future new york city energy requirements 
competition facing our unregulated energy services businesses  including but not limited to competition from other mechanical  plumbing  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  and engineering companies  as well as  other utilities and utility holding companies that are permitted to engage in such activities  could adversely impact our financial results and the value of those businesses  resulting in decreased earnings as well as write downs of the carrying value of those businesses 
our gas distribution segment faces competition with distributors of alternative fuels and forms of energy  including fuel oil and propane 
our ability to continue to add new gas distribution customers may significantly impact financial results 
the gas distribution industry has experienced a decrease in consumption per customer over time  partially due to increased efficiency of customers appliances 
our gas distribution segment is dependent upon the ability to add new customers to our system in a cost effective manner 
while our long island and new england utilities have significant growth potential  we cannot be sure new customers will continue to offset the decrease in consumption of our existing customer base 
there are a number of factors outside of our control that impact whether a potential customer converts from an alternative fuel to gas  including general economic factors impacting customers willingness to invest in new gas equipment 
employee matters as of december   keyspan and its wholly owned subsidiaries had approximately  employees 
of that total  approximately  employees in our regulated companies are covered under collective bargaining agreements 
keyspan has not experienced any work stoppage during the past five years and considers its relationship with employees  including those covered by collective bargaining agreements  to be good 
prior to their expiration in february  keyspan reached tentative agreements with ibew locals and on new collective bargaining agreements 
these unions represent keyspan employees in physical and clerical positions respectively  and serve our long island customers 
the new four year agreements are expected to be ratified by each respective union before the end of march executive officers of the company

the energy investment segment benefited from higher earnings associated with gas exploration and production activities as a result of significantly higher realized gas prices and higher production volumes 
the gas distribution segment benefited from colder weather during the january through march heating season compared to the same period last year  as well as from load growth 
further  during we recorded million in gains from property sales  primarily acres of real property located on long island 
the energy services group of companies were adversely impacted by the decline in construction industry activity in the northeastern united states during most of the year 
lower results from the electric services segment were attributable to higher operating costs  as well as lower revenues from our merchant generating facility  due in part to cooler summer weather 
see the discussion under the caption review of operating segments for further details on each segment 
interest charges increased in  compared to last year  primarily as a result of the termination of certain interest rate derivative swap instruments that were in effect in see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments and fair values

income taxes were not provided on this transaction since the transaction was structured as a return of capital 
in total  keyspan recorded a pre tax gain of million from the monetization of certain non core assets 
the after tax gain from these three asset sales  however  was minimal due to the different tax treatment associated with each transaction

further  houston exploration incurred costs of million to retire million of notes due other income and deductions also reflects severance tax refunds totaling million recorded by houston exploration for severance taxes paid in and earlier periods  compared to million recorded in  as well as million of realized foreign currency translation gains 
finally  other income and deductions reflects minority interest adjustments related to houston exploration and keyspan canada  as well as carrying charges on certain regulatory assets 
the increase in income tax expense in compared to generally reflects a higher level of pre tax earnings 
further income tax expense for and includes a number of items impacting comparative results 
during  the partial monetization of our canadian investments resulted in tax expense of million  reflecting certain united states partnership tax rules 
in addition  we recorded an adjustment to income tax expense of million due to the state of massachusetts disallowing the carry forward of net operating losses incurred by regulated utilities 
offsetting  to some extent  these increases to tax expense  was a tax benefit recorded in of million associated with certain new york city general corporation tax issues

in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation number fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 fin requires consolidation of variable interest entities 
keyspan has an arrangement with a variable interest entity through which we lease a portion of the  megawatt ravenswood electric generating facility ravenswood facility 
based upon keyspan s current status as the primary beneficiary  we were required to consolidate the variable interest entity as of december  as a result of implementing fin  we recognized a non cash  after tax charge of million  or per share related to catch up depreciation of the facility since its acquisition in june and recorded the charge as a cumulative change in accounting principle 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for an explanation of the leasing arrangement for the ravenswood facility  as well as an explanation of the implementation of fin as a result of the above mentioned items  income from continuing operations  less preferred stock dividends  increased million  or in compared to earnings per share from continuing operations  however  decreased by per share  reflecting the issuance of million shares of common stock on january   as well as the re issuance of shares held in treasury pursuant to dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans

operating income for the year ended december   increased million compared to the same period in the increase in operating income primarily reflects the following two significant events that are discussed in more detail below i the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in  and ii the recording of special items in which resulted in the recognition of certain gains and losses 
these benefits to comparative operating income were offset  in part  by a decrease in natural gas prices  particularly during the first quarter of  which reduced earnings associated with gas exploration and production operations 
further  the impact of extremely warm weather during the first quarter of adversely impacted natural gas consumption by gas distribution customers and operating income in the gas distribution segment 
see review of operating segments for a detailed discussion of operating income for each of keyspan s lines of business 
in january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
the key requirements of this statement include the discontinuance of goodwill amortization  a revised framework for testing goodwill impairment and new criteria for the identification of intangible assets 
consolidated goodwill amortization for was million  or per share 
during  we recorded the effects of a number of events that impacted results of operations for that year 
these events are as follows we incurred million in pre tax operating losses attributed to the former roy kay companies million after tax  or per share  primarily reflecting costs related to the discontinuance of the general contracting activities of these companies  costs to complete work on certain loss construction projects  as well as operating losses incurred 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  roy kay operations and note contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies legal matters  for a further discussion of these issues  our gas exploration and production subsidiaries recorded a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million to recognize the effect of lower wellhead prices on their valuation of proved gas reserves

interest expense decreased million in compared to the weighted average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper for was approximately compared to approximately in further  keyspan had a number of interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
the use of these derivative instruments reduced interest expense by million in see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments  and fair values for a description of these instruments 
interest expense in reflects the reversal of million in accrued interest expense resulting from the rico class action settlement  as noted previously 
income tax expense generally reflects the level of pre tax income in and however  as noted above  during we finalized the valuation study related to the assets transferred to keyspan resulting from the keyspan lilco business combination completed in may as a result of an adjustment to deferred taxes and current income taxes payable  keyspan recognized a million income tax benefit 
income tax expense for also reflects additional tax benefits of approximately million resulting from the finalization of amended tax returns and the reversal of certain tax reserves

consolidated earnings are seasonal in nature due to the significant contribution to earnings of our gas distribution operations 
as a result  we expect to earn most of our annual earnings in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
review of operating segments in response to new disclosure regulations adopted by the securities and exchange commission sec as part of its implementation of the sarbanes oxley act of specifically regulation g  which became effective march we are reporting all of keyspan s segment results on an operating income basis for  and management believes that this generally accepted accounting principle gaap based measure provides a reasonable indication of keyspan s underlying performance associated with its operations 
the following is a discussion of financial results achieved by keyspan s operating segments presented on an operating income basis 
gas distribution keyspan energy delivery new york kedny provides gas distribution service to customers in the new york city boroughs of brooklyn  staten island and a portion of queens 
keyspan energy delivery long island kedli provides gas distribution service to customers in the long island counties of nassau and suffolk and the rockaway peninsula of queens county 
four natural gas distribution companies boston gas company  essex gas company  colonial gas company and energynorth natural gas  inc  each doing business under the name keyspan energy delivery new england kedne  provide gas distribution service to customers in massachusetts and new hampshire

a therm reflects the heating content of approximately cubic feet of gas 
one billion cubic feet bcf of gas equals approximately  mdth 
net revenues net gas revenues revenues less the cost of gas and associated revenue taxes from our gas distribution operations increased by million  or  for the year ended december   compared to last year 
both our new york and new england based gas distribution operations benefited from the significantly colder than normal weather experienced throughout the northeastern united states  particularly during the primary winter heating months  january through march  when our gas distribution operations realize over of their yearly operating income 
as measured in heating degree days  weather during the first quarter of was approximately colder than normal in our new york and new england service territories 
this contrasts with the extremely warm weather experienced during the first quarter of when weather was approximately warmer than normal 
on a twelve month basis  weather was approximately colder than normal in compared to warmer than normal in net gas revenues from firm gas customers residential  commercial and industrial customers in our new york service territories increased by million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period last year 
customer additions and oil to gas conversions  net of attrition and conservation  added approximately million to net revenues during the effect of higher customer consumption in due primarily to colder than normal weather  coupled with lower customer consumption in due to the extremely warmer than normal weather resulted in a comparative increase to firm net revenues of approximately million in compared to however  kedny and kedli each operate under a utility tariff that contains a weather normalization adjustment that significantly offsets variations in firm net revenues due to fluctuations from normal weather 
these tariff provisions resulted in a million refund to firm gas customers during also included in net revenues are regulatory incentives that reduced comparative net revenues by million and recovery of certain taxes that added million to net revenues during the recovery of taxes through revenues  however  does not impact net income since we expense a similar amount as amortization charges and income taxes  as appropriate  on the consolidated statement of income 
net gas revenues from firm gas customers in our new england service territories increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the same period last year 
customer additions and oil to gas conversions  net of attrition and conservation  added approximately million to net revenues 
as with our new york service territories  higher customer consumption in due to the colder than normal weather  coupled with lower customer consumption in due to the warmer than normal weather  resulted in an increase in comparative net revenues for our new england based gas distribution utilities of approximately million in compared to the gas distribution operations of our new england based subsidiaries do not have a weather normalization adjustment 
to mitigate the effect of fluctuations from normal weather patterns on kedne s results of operations and cash flows  weather derivatives were put in place for the and winter heating seasons 
since weather during the first quarter of was colder than normal in the new england service territories  we recorded an million reduction to revenues to reflect the loss on these derivative transactions 
similarly  in we recorded a million reduction to revenues 
as a result of these transactions  comparative net revenues were adversely impacted by million 
weather derivatives had only a marginal impact on net revenues during the fourth quarter of  since weather was approximately normal 
see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments and fair values for further information 
also included in net revenues for are million of base rate adjustments resulting from boston gas company s recently concluded rate case 
further  included in net revenues for  was a benefit of million as a result of a favorable ruling from the massachusetts supreme judicial court relating to the appeal by boston gas company of its performance based rate plan pbr 
the net effect of these base rate adjustments was a favorable impact to comparative net revenues in of million 
see regulation and rate matters for a further discussion of these matters 
firm gas distribution rates for kedny and kedli in  other than for the recovery of gas costs  have remained substantially unchanged from rates charged last year 
as noted  firm gas distribution rates for kedne reflect an increase of million resulting from the boston gas company s rate order  which became effective november  in our large volume heating and other interruptible non firm markets  which include large apartment houses  government buildings and schools  gas service is provided under rates that are designed to compete with prices of alternative fuel  including no 
and no 
grade heating oil 
net revenues from sales to these markets increased by million during the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period last year 
the majority of interruptible profits earned by kedne and kedli are returned to firm customers as an offset to gas costs 
during  combined net gas revenues from our gas distribution operations increased by million  or compared to both the new york and new england based gas distribution operations were adversely impacted by the significantly warmer than normal weather experienced throughout the northeastern united states during  particularly during the first quarter 
weather during the primary heating seasons  january through march  was approximately warmer than normal  across our service territories 
net revenues from firm gas customers in our new york service territories increased million  or  in compared to included in net revenues are regulatory incentives and recovery of certain taxes that added million and million to net revenues during  respectively 
as mentioned previously  the recovery of taxes through revenues does not impact net income 
excluding both the regulatory incentives and tax recoveries  comparative net revenues decreased million 
during  our new york based gas distribution utilities added approximately million in gross gas load additions through oil to gas conversions  as well as from new construction 
further  as mentioned  kedny and kedli each operate under utility tariffs that contain a weather normalization adjustment 
these tariff provisions resulted in an increase to net gas revenues of million in however the benefits from load additions and the weather normalization adjustment were offset by declining usage per customer due to the extremely warm first quarter weather and the use of more efficient gas heating equipment 
additionally  the down turn in the economy throughout the northeastern united states adversely impacted gas consumption in net revenues from firm gas customers in the new england service territories increased by million  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of approximately million in gross load additions 
also included in net revenues are base rate adjustments totaling million associated with boston gas company s pbr 
the largest component of this adjustment reflects the beneficial effect of a favorable ruling of the massachusetts supreme judicial court relating to the accumulated inefficiencies component of the productivity factor in the pbr 
this ruling resulted in a benefit to comparative net margins of million 
see regulation and rate matters for a further discussion of this matter 
offsetting  to some extent  these benefits to revenues were the adverse effects of declining usage per customer due to the extremely warm first quarter weather and the use of more efficient gas heating equipment 
additionally  the down turn in the economy throughout the northeastern united states adversely impacted gas consumption in as mentioned previously  the new england based gas distribution subsidiaries do not have weather normalization adjustments 
to lessen  to some extent  the effect of fluctuations from normal weather patterns on kedne s results of operations and cash flows  weather derivatives were in place for the winter heating season 
since weather during the fourth quarter of was colder than normal in the new england service territories  we recorded a million reduction to revenues to reflect the loss on these derivative transactions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments  and fair values for further information 
firm gas distribution rates in  excluding gas cost recoveries  remained substantially unchanged from in all of our service territories 
net revenues from sales in the large volume heating and other interruptible non firm markets were consistent between and we are committed to our expansion strategy initiated during the past few years 
we believe that significant growth opportunities exist on long island and in our new england service territories 
we estimate that on long island approximately of the residential and multi family markets  and approximately of the commercial market currently use natural gas for space heating 
further  we estimate that in our new england service territories approximately of the residential and multi family markets  and approximately of the commercial market  currently use natural gas for space heating purposes 
we will continue to seek growth in all our market segments  through the economic expansion of our gas distribution system  as well as through the conversion of residential homes from oil to gas for space heating purposes and the pursuit of opportunities to grow the multi family  industrial and commercial markets 
firm sales  transportation and other quantities total actual firm gas sales and transportation quantities increased by during the year ended december   compared to the same period in in the new york service territories actual firm sales increased  while firm sales in the new england service territories increased 
weather normalized sales quantities increased in the new york service territories and in the new england service territories 
the increases in both actual and weather normalized gas sale quantities reflect higher customer consumption as a result of the significantly colder than normal weather in  as well as from customer additions and oil to gas conversions for space heating purposes 
further  as mentioned previously  gas sales quantities in were adversely impacted by the exceptionally warm weather 
in  total actual firm gas sales and transportation quantities remained consistent with in the new york service territories  actual and weather normalized firm gas sales and transportation quantities decreased slightly in compared to  due to the exceptionally warm weather 
however  in the new england services territories  firm gas sales and transportation quantities increased  despite the warm first quarter weather  due to load additions 
net revenues are not affected by customers opting to purchase their gas supply from other sources  since delivery rates charged to transportation customers generally are the same as delivery rates charged to sales service customers 
transportation quantities related to electric generation reflect the transportation of gas to our electric generating facilities located on long island 
net revenues from these services are not material 
other sales quantities include on system interruptible quantities  off system sales quantities sales made to customers outside of our service territories and related transportation 
we have an agreement with coral resources  lp coral  a subsidiary of shell oil company  under which coral assists in the origination  structuring  valuation and execution of energy related transactions on behalf of kedny and kedli 
we also have a portfolio management contract with entergy koch trading  lp ekt  under which ekt provides all of the city gate supply requirements at market prices and manages certain upstream capacity  underground storage and term supply contracts for kedne 
these agreements expire on march  purchased gas for resale the increase in gas costs for the year ended december  compared to the same period in of million  or  reflects an increase of in the price per dekatherm of gas purchased  and a increase in the quantity of gas purchased 
the decrease in gas costs in compared to of million  or  reflects a decrease of in the price per dekatherm of gas purchased  partially offset by a increase in the quantity of gas purchased 
the current gas rate structure of each of our gas distribution utilities includes a purchased gas adjustment clause  pursuant to which variations between actual gas costs incurred for resale to firm sales customers and gas costs billed to firm sales customers are deferred and refunded to or collected from customers in a subsequent period 
operating expenses operating expenses in increased million  or  compared to last year 
this increase is primarily attributable to higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs  which have increased net of amounts deferred and subject to regulatory true ups by million during the cost of these benefits has risen primarily as a result of lower actual returns on plan assets  as well as increased health care costs 
further  the colder weather experienced during resulted in a higher level of repair and maintenance work on our gas distribution infrastructure which increased comparative operating expenses by approximately million 
higher depreciation and amortization expense reflects the continued expansion of the gas distribution system 
further  included in depreciation and amortization expense is the amortization of certain property taxes previously deferred and currently being recovered in revenues 
comparative operating taxes reflect a favorable million adjustment recorded during relating to the reversal of excess tax reserves established for the keyspan lilco combination in may operating expenses decreased by million in compared to comparative operating expenses were significantly impacted by the discontinuation of goodwill amortization 
as mentioned earlier  in january  we adopted sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  which required  among other things  the discontinuation of goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization in the gas distribution segment for the twelve months ended december  was million 
excluding the effects of this amortization  operating expenses increased by million  or  in compared to the increase in operating expense in is attributable  in part  to higher pension and other postretirement benefits which increased by approximately million  net of amounts deferred and subject to regulatory true ups  over the level incurred in further  depreciation and amortization expense  excluding the goodwill amortization  increased as a result of the continued expansion of the gas distribution system 
offsetting  to some extent  these increases to operating expenses is the favorable million adjustment to operating taxes recorded in related to the reversal of certain operating tax reserves established for the keyspan lilco combination as previously noted 
further  we realized cost saving synergies as a result of early retirement and severance programs implemented in the fourth quarter of the early retirement portion of the program was completed in  but the severance feature continued through sale of property during we recorded million in gains from property sales  primarily acres of real property located on long island 
other matters as previously mentioned  there remain significant growth opportunities in our long island and new england gas distribution service areas 
the northeast region represents a significant portion of the country s population and energy consumption 
cost efficient gas sales growth and customer additions are critical to our earnings in the future 
however  the beneficial effect of our growth initiatives may not be fully realized in the short term since we will continue to make incremental investments in our gas distribution network to optimize the long term growth opportunities in our service territories 
in order to serve the anticipated market requirements in our new york service territories  keyspan and duke energy corporation formed islander east pipeline company  llc islander east in islander east is owned by keyspan and by duke energy  and was created to pursue the authorization and construction of an interstate pipeline from connecticut  across long island sound  to a terminus near northport  long island 
applications for all necessary regulatory authorizations were filed in and to date  islander east has received a final certificate from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and all necessary permits from the state of new york 
however  the state of connecticut has denied islander east s application for a coastal zone management permit and a permit under section of the clean water act 
islander east has reinstated its appeal of the state of connecticut s determination on the coastal zone management issue to the united states department of commerce and is evaluating its legal and other options with respect to the section issue 
once in service  the pipeline is expected to transport up to  dth daily to the long island and new york city energy markets  enough natural gas to heat  homes 
the pipeline will also allow keyspan to diversify the geographic sources of its gas supply 
however  we are unable to predict when or if all regulatory approvals required to construct this pipeline will be obtained 
various options for the financing of pipeline construction are currently being evaluated 
at december   total expenditures associated with the siting and permitting of the islander east pipeline were million 
electric services the electric services segment primarily consists of subsidiaries that own and operate oil and gas fired electric generating plants in the new york city borough of queens the ravenswood facility and the counties of nassau and suffolk on long island and on the rockaway peninsula in queens 
in addition  through long term contracts of varying lengths  we manage the electric transmission and distribution t d system  the fuel and electric purchases  and the off system electric sales for lipa 
selected financial data for the electric services segment is set forth in the table below for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    purchased fuel    net revenues    operating expenses operations and maintenance    depreciation    operating taxes    total operating expenses    gain on the sale of property  operating income    electric sales mwh    capacity mw    cooling degree days    reflects the operations of the ravenswood facility only 
net revenues total electric net revenues decreased million  or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in net revenues from the ravenswood facility were million lower in compared to comparative net revenues reflect higher capacity revenues of million  offset by a decrease in energy margins of million 
the increase in capacity revenues reflects an increase in the level of capacity sold  as well as an increase in the selling price of capacity 
such increases are the result of two measures 
first  in  the new york independent system operator nyiso employed a revised methodology to assess the available supply of and demand for installed capacity 
this revised methodology resulted in insufficient capacity being procured by the market  which caused a reliability concern 
further  the revised methodology resulted in lower capacity volume sold into the nyiso and depressed capacity pricing during the year ended december  the nyiso  however  recognized a calculation flaw in its revised methodology  and prior to the winter season capacity auction  corrected the calculation methodology to ensure that sufficient capacity is procured 
elimination of the flaw ensured compliance with new york state reliability rules and resulted in higher capacity revenue realized at the ravenswood facility in compared to the prior year 
in addition  on may   the federal energy regulatory commission ferc approved the nyiso s revised capacity market procurement design with an effective date of may  this revised capacity market procurement design is based on a demand curve rather than relying on deficiency auctions to procure necessary capacity 
the deficiency auction with its associated fixed minimum capacity requirements was replaced with a spot market auction that pays gradually declining prices as additional capacity is offered and gradually increasing prices as capacity offers decrease 
this new market design recognizes the value of capacity in excess of the minimum requirement and reduces price spikes during periods of shortage 
essentially  the demand curve design eliminates the high and low cycles inherent in the deficiency auction market design 
this new market design also established seasonal electric generator specific price caps 
price caps establish the maximum price per megawatt mw that capacity can be sold into the nyiso by divested electric generators like ravenswood 
prior to this design change  one price cap was established for the entire year and was effective for all electric generators 
for the ravenswood facility  its summer price cap was higher than the yearly price cap effective during the summer 
as a result of these market design changes  the ravenswood facility realized higher capacity revenues during compared to it should be noted  however  that ravenswood s structured winter price cap will be lower than the yearly price cap effective during the winter  which was prior to the implementation of the new demand curve methodology 
the decrease in comparative energy margins in primarily reflects significantly cooler weather during the summer of compared to the summer of measured in cooling degree days  weather for was cooler than last year 
the cooler weather resulted in lower realized spark spreads the selling price of electricity less cost of fuel  plus hedging gains or losses  as well as a reduction in megawatt hours sold into the nyiso 
further  more competitive behavior by market participants that bid into the nyiso  as well as certain price mitigation measures imposed by the ferc as discussed below have resulted in lower comparative realized spark spreads 
energy sales quantities during a portion of were also adversely impacted by the scheduled major overhaul of our largest generating unit 
we employ derivative financial hedging instruments to hedge the cash flow variability for a portion of forecasted purchases of natural gas and fuel oil consumed at the ravenswood facility 
further  we have engaged in the use of derivative financial hedging instruments to hedge the cash flow variability associated with a portion of forecasted peak electric energy sales from the ravenswood facility 
these derivative instruments resulted in hedging gains  which are reflected in net electric margins  of million for the year ended december  compared to hedging gains of million for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments  and fair values for further information 
the rules and regulations for capacity  energy sales and the sale of certain ancillary services to the nyiso energy markets continue to evolve and the ferc has adopted several price mitigation measures that have adversely impacted earnings from the ravenswood facility 
certain of these mitigation measures are still subject to rehearing and possible judicial review 
the final resolution of these issues and their effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows cannot be fully determined at this time 
see the discussion under the caption market and credit risk management activities for more information 
net revenues from the service agreements with lipa decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
included in revenues are billings to lipa for certain third party costs that were lower than such billings last year 
these revenues have minimal or no impact on earnings since we record a similar amount of costs in operating expense and we share any cost under runs with lipa 
excluding these third party billings  revenues in associated with these service agreements increased approximately million compared to last year 
the increase reflects a higher level of service fees charged to lipa for the recovery of past operating costs 
in we earned million associated with non cost performance incentives provided for under these agreements  compared to million earned last year 
for a description of the lipa agreements  see the discussion under the caption lipa agreements 
net revenues from the new electric peaking facilities located at glenwood landing and port jefferson on long island were million higher in compared to  reflecting a full year of operation 
the glenwood facility was placed in service on june   while the port jefferson facility was placed in service on july  these facilities added a combined megawatts of generating capacity to keyspan s electric generation portfolio 
the capacity of and energy produced by these facilities are dedicated to lipa under year contracts 
total electric net revenues increased by million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in net revenues in reflect net revenues of million from the glenwood landing and port jefferson facilities 
net revenues from the lipa agreements increased by million in  compared to included in revenues for  are billings to lipa for certain third party costs that were significantly higher than such billings in the prior year 
as previously mentioned  these revenues have minimal impact on earnings 
excluding these third party billings  revenues for associated with the lipa agreements were comparable to such revenues in in we earned million associated with non cost performance incentives provided for under these agreements  compared to million earned in net revenues from the ravenswood facility were million  or  lower in  compared to net revenues from capacity sales decreased million compared to  while margins associated with the sale of electric energy decreased million 
during we changed our classification of certain operating taxes that resulted in a comparative decrease in energy margins 
further  comparative energy sales were adversely impacted by a reduction in spark spread 
measured in cooling degree days  weather during and was comparable 
the decrease in net revenues from capacity sales in was due  in part  to more competitive pricing by the electric generators that bid into the nyiso energy market which lowered capacity clearing prices by approximately compared to further  as mentioned earlier  the nyiso revised its methodology employed to determine the available supply of and demand for installed capacity that also had an adverse impact on the capacity market by reducing the capacity required to be purchased by load serving entities such as electric utilities 
derivative instruments resulted in hedging gains  which are reflected in net electric margins  of million for the year ended december  compared to hedging gains of million for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments  and fair values for further information 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared to included in comparative operating expenses is a decrease in third party capital costs that are fully recoverable from lipa  as noted previously 
excluding the decrease in these costs  operating expenses increased approximately million 
this increase resulted  in part  from higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
lipa reimburses keyspan for costs directly incurred by keyspan in providing service to lipa  subject to certain sharing provisions 
variations between pension and other postretirement costs and the estimates used to bill lipa are deferred and refunded to or collected from lipa in subsequent periods 
as a result of an adjustment recorded in relating to this true up  comparative pension and other postretirement costs were approximately million higher in compared to in addition  in we settled certain outstanding issues with lipa and the consolidated edison company of new york consolidated edison that resulted in a million decrease to operating expenses in operating taxes reflect an increase in property tax rates associated with the ravenswood facility 
the increase in depreciation expense is associated with the glenwood and port jefferson facilities 
operating expenses were million lower in compared to excluding the increase in third party capital costs  operating expenses decreased by approximately million in compared to as a result of an adjustment recorded in relating to the pension and other postretirement benefit true up as previously mentioned  comparative pension and other postretirement costs were approximately million lower in compared to further  during we settled certain outstanding issues with lipa and consolidated edison  as previously noted  that resulted in a million decrease to comparative operating expenses 
also in we changed our method for recording certain operating taxes that resulted in a comparative decrease in operating taxes 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily reflects depreciation associated with the new peaking facilities 
other matters during  construction began on a new mw combined cycle generating facility at the ravenswood facility site 
the new facility was synchronized to the electric grid in december and commenced operational testing in january in march  the facility completed full load dependable maximum net capacity testing 
the capacity and energy produced from this plant are anticipated to be sold into the nyiso energy markets during the second quarter of keyspan intends to enter into an approximately million sale leaseback transaction with third parties to finance the cost of this facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements subsequent events for a further discussion regarding this proposed transaction 
in  the new york state board on electric generation siting and the environment issued an opinion and order which granted a certificate of environmental capability and public need for a mw combined cycle electric generating facility in melville  long island  which is now final and non appealable 
also in  lipa issued a request for proposal rfp seeking bids from developers to either build and operate a long island generating facility  and or a new cable that will link long island to dedicated off long island power of between to mw of electricity by no later than the summer of keyspan and american national power inc anp filed a joint proposal in response to lipa s rfp 
under the proposal  keyspan and anp will jointly own and operate two mw electric generating facilities to be located on long island 
it is anticipated that lipa will respond to the joint proposal early in at december   total expenditures associated with the siting  permitting and construction of the ravenswood expansion project  and the siting  permitting and procurement of equipment for the long island mw combined cycle electric generating facility were million 
as part of our growth strategy  we continually evaluate the possible acquisition and development of additional generating facilities in the northeast 
however  we are unable to predict when or if any such facilities will be acquired and the effect any such acquired facilities will have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
energy services the energy services segment includes companies that provide services to clients located primarily within the northeastern united states  with concentrations in the new york city metropolitan area  including new jersey and connecticut  as well as in rhode island  pennsylvania  massachusetts and new hampshire 
the primary lines of business are business solutions and home energy services 
the table below highlights selected financial information for the energy services segment 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    less cost of gas and fuel    net revenues    other operating expenses    operating loss    revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year  due in part to lower revenues realized by the business solutions group of companies as a result of the softness in the construction industry in the northeastern united states  as well as from the discontinuation of the general contracting business of one of our subsidiaries 
the business solutions group of companies provide mechanical  contracting  plumbing  engineering  and consulting services to commercial  institutional  and industrial customers 
further  comparative revenues  as well as gas and fuel costs  were impacted by the assignment of retail natural gas customers  consisting mostly of residential and small commercial customers  to econnergy energy co  inc econnergy 
keyspan energy services will continue its electric marketing activities 
total operating losses for the energy services segment increased million in compared to operating losses for the business solutions group of companies increased by million  reflecting revenue and significant gross margin pressure from the softness in the construction industry  which has delayed the start up of certain engineering and construction projects  and has generally increased competition for remaining opportunities 
in addition  margins were impacted by certain project specific losses  resulting from costs incurred in excess of cost recoveries  for which some recovery may be possible pending successful claim resolution 
business solutions backlog held relatively stable at approximately million at december  which includes backlog of million purchased in a recent acquisition as discussed below  compared to million at december  offsetting  in part  the results of the business solutions group of companies  was a comparative increase in operating earnings of million for the year ended december  associated with the home energy services group of companies 
these companies provide residential and small commercial customers with service and maintenance contracts  as well as the retail marketing of electricity 
comparative operating income reflects losses incurred during  resulting from the non renewal of appliance service contracts due to the warm first quarter weather  as well as from an increase in the provision for bad debts 
comparative operating income results for compared to were significantly impacted by losses incurred by one of our subsidiaries 
in  we discontinued the general contracting activities related to the former roy kay companies  with the exception of completion of work on then existing contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements roy kay operations for a more detailed discussion 
for the year ended december   we incurred an operating loss of million associated with the operations of the former roy kay companies 
the roy kay results reflect costs related to the discontinuation of the general contracting activities of these companies  costs to complete work on certain loss construction projects  as well as operating losses 
during  in completing the contracts entered into by the former roy kay companies we incurred operating losses of million reflecting increases in costs to complete construction contracts  and general and administrative expenses 
it should be noted that in we incurred million in operating losses which reflected provisions made for the resolution of outstanding claims and change orders  as well as additional costs incurred in connection with the collection of outstanding contract balances 
excluding the results of the former roy kay companies  the energy services segment reflected an increase in operating income of million in compared to revenues  excluding the roy kay companies  decreased by million in  while the cost of fuel decreased by million 
these declines  which for the most part offset each other  reflect the operations of our gas and electric marketing subsidiary 
in  this subsidiary substantially decreased its customer base by focusing its marketing efforts on higher net margin customers and in assigned the majority of its retail natural gas customers to econnergy  as previously discussed 
operating income for the business solutions group of companies improved by million in compared to this increase reflected additional work being performed on the backlog of projects existing at the end of and the absence of million in losses incurred on four major projects in a backlog of approximately million existed at december   which was below the december  level 
offsetting the positive contribution to operating income in by the business solutions group of companies was a decrease of million associated with the home energy services group of companies 
contributing to the decrease in operating income from home energy services were the following factors i the adverse impact of the downturn in the economy in  ii the non renewal of appliance service contracts due to the warm first quarter weather  iii costs associated with the closing of a service center  and iv an increase in the reserve for bad debts 
comparative operating income in also benefited from the elimination of goodwill amortization  which for amounted to million 
other matters during the third quarter of  keyspan services  inc  and its wholly owned subsidiary  paulus  sokolowski and sartor  llc  acquired bard  rao athanas consulting engineers  inc br a  a company engaged in the business of providing engineering services relating to mechanical  electrical and plumbing systems 
the purchase price was million  plus up to million in contingent consideration depending on the financial performance of br a over the five year period after the closing of the acquisition 
we have recorded goodwill of million and intangible assets of million associated with this transaction 
the intangible assets  which relate primarily to a portion of the backlog purchased  as well as to non compete agreements with all of the former owners of br a  will be amortized over two and three years  respectively 
energy investments the energy investment segment consists of our gas exploration and production operations  certain other domestic and international energy related investments  as well as certain technology related investments 
our gas exploration and production subsidiaries  houston exploration and keyspan exploration and production  llc kes e p are engaged in gas and oil exploration and production  and the development and acquisition of domestic natural gas and oil properties 
in line with our strategy of monetizing or divesting certain non core assets  in we sold a portion of our assets in the joint venture drilling program with houston exploration that was initiated in in we reduced our ownership interest in houston exploration to approximately from the previous level of through the repurchase  by houston exploration  of three million shares of common stock owned by keyspan 
the net proceeds of approximately million received in connection with this repurchase were used to pay down short term debt 
we realized a million gain on this transaction that was recorded in other income and deductions in the consolidated statement of income 
income taxes were not provided on this transaction  since the transaction was structured as a return of capital 
in  houston exploration acquired the entire gulf of mexico shallow water asset base of transworld exploration and production  inc for million 
the properties  which are natural gas  have proven reserves of approximately billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent 
current production from fields is approximately million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day 
houston exploration funded the transaction from its bank revolver and from cash on hand at the time of closing 
selected financial data and operating statistics for our gas exploration and production activities is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    depletion and amortization expense    full cost ceiling test write down  other operating expenses    operating income    natural gas and oil production mmcf    natural gas per mcf realized natural gas per mcf unhedged operating income above represents of our gas exploration and production subsidiaries results for the periods indicated 
gas reserves and production are stated in bcfe and mmcfe  which includes equivalent oil reserves operating income the increase in operating income of million or for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  reflects a significant increase in revenues 
the higher revenues were offset  to some extent  by an increase in operating expenses associated with a higher depletion rate  as well as higher lease operating expenses and severance taxes  as discussed below 
revenues for the year ended benefited from the combination of a increase in average realized gas prices average wellhead price received for production including hedging gains and losses and a increase in production volumes 
derivative financial hedging instruments are employed by houston exploration to provide more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
the average realized gas price for the year ended was of the average unhedged natural gas price  resulting in revenues that were approximately million lower than revenues that would have been achieved if derivative financial instruments had not been in place during houston exploration hedged slightly less than of its production  principally through the use of costless collars  and has hedged a similar amount of its estimated production 
further  at december   houston exploration has derivative financial instruments in place for approximately of its estimated production 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  hedging  derivative financial instruments  and fair values for further information 
the depletion rate experienced in was per mcf  compared to per mcf experienced in the increase in the depletion rate reflects downward reserve revisions related to performance  the addition of more costs to houston exploration s depreciation base with fewer additions for reserves  as well as an increase in estimated future development costs at year end 
the increase in other operating expenses for the year ended december   compared to the same period of was primarily due to increased lease operating costs and severance taxes 
lease operating expenses increased million in compared to  as a result of the continued expansion of operations both onshore and offshore 
severance tax  which is a function of volume and revenues generated from onshore production  increased million in compared to as a result of the increase in average wellhead prices for natural gas 
overall operating expenses are increasing as new wells and facilities are added and production from existing wells is maintained 
operating income decreased million or in compared to primarily due to a reduction in average realized gas prices  which lowered comparative revenues 
further  operating expenses increased as a result of higher levels of production and a higher depletion rate  as well as from an increase in lease operating expenses 
the adverse effect on revenues resulting from the decline in average realized gas prices was partially offset by an increase of in production volumes 
the average realized gas price for was of the average unhedged natural gas price  resulting in revenues that were approximately million higher than revenues that would have been achieved if derivative financial instruments had not been in place during houston exploration hedged approximately of its production  principally through the use of costless collars 
the depletion rate was per mcf for the year ended december   compared to per mcf for the same period in  reflecting higher finding and development costs together with the addition of fewer new reserves 
in  our gas exploration and production subsidiaries recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to recognize the effect of lower wellhead prices on their valuation of proved gas reserves 
our share of this charge  which includes our joint venture ownership interest and minority interest  was million after tax 
see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies  item f for more information on this charge 
natural gas prices continue to be volatile and the risk that we may be required to record an impairment charge on our full cost pool again in the future increases when natural gas prices are depressed or if we have significant downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves 
the table below indicates the net proved reserves of our gas exploration and production subsidiaries for the periods indicated 
year ended december  bcfe bcfe bcfe houston exploration kse e p total this segment also consists of keyspan canada  our interest in iroquois gas transmission system lp iroquois  our wholly owned  barrel liquefied natural gas lng storage and receiving facility located in rhode island keyspan lng  and our interest in premier transmission limited  and until december  our interest in phoenix natural gas limited  both located in northern ireland 
selected financial data for our other energy related investments is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    less operation and maintenance expense    other operating expenses    add equity earnings    gain on sale of property  operating income    operating income above reflects of keyspan s canada s results 
the increase in operating income in compared to last year reflects  in part  higher operating income associated with our canadian investments  primarily keyspan canada  as well as higher earnings from our northern ireland investments 
keyspan canada experienced higher unit sales  as well as higher quantities of sales of natural gas liquids in  as a result of increasing oil prices 
the pricing of natural gas liquids is directly related to oil prices 
the northern ireland investments realized higher gas sales quantities  as well as favorable exchange rates during operating income for also reflects our investment in keyspan lng storage facility located in rhode island  which we acquired in december the increase in operating income in compared to reflects lower comparative losses associated with certain technology related investments 
further  higher operating income from our northern ireland investments were  for the most part  offset by lower earnings realized by keyspan canada 
keyspan canada experienced lower per unit sales prices  as well as lower quantities of sales of natural gas liquids in  as a result of generally lower oil prices 
keyspan has announced an initiative to upgrade the storage and receiving terminal and enhance the vaporization capacity at the keyspan lng facility located in providence  rhode island 
pending approvals  the facility could be ready to accept marine deliveries by we anticipate making an investment of approximately million to upgrade the facility 
we do not consider certain businesses contained in the energy investments segment to be part of our core asset group 
we have stated in the past that we may sell or otherwise dispose of all or a portion of our non core assets 
as previously indicated  in we monetized of our interest in keyspan canada  a company with natural gas processing plants and gathering facilities in western canada 
these assets include processing plants and associated gathering systems that can process approximately bcfe of natural gas daily and provide associated natural gas liquids fractionation 
we sold a portion of our interest in keyspan canada through the establishment of an open ended income fund trust the fund organized under the laws of alberta  canada 
the fund acquired the ownership interest of keyspan canada through an indirect subsidiary  and then issued million trust units to the public through an initial public offering 
each trust unit represents a beneficial interest in the fund and is registered on the toronto stock exchange key 
un 
additionally  we sold our interest in taylor ngl lp that owns and operates two extraction plants in canada to altagas services  inc we received cash proceeds of million associated with these transactions and recorded a pre tax loss of million million after tax 
in february  keyspan entered into an agreement to sell an additional of its interest in keyspan canada 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  subsequent events 
further  in the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of our interest in phoenix natural gas limited 
we received cash proceeds of million and recorded a pre tax gain of million  million after tax  or per share 
based on current market conditions we cannot predict when  or if  any other sales or dispositions of our non core assets may take place  or the effect that any such sale or disposition may have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
allocated costs as previously mentioned  we are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec under puhca 
as part of the regulatory provisions of puhca  the sec regulates various transactions among affiliates within a holding company system 
in accordance with the regulations of puhca and the new york state public service commission requirements  we have non operating service companies that provide i traditional corporate and administrative services  ii gas and electric transmission and distribution systems planning  marketing  and gas supply planning and procurement  and iii engineering and surveying services to subsidiaries 
revised allocation methodologies  approved by the sec  have been in use since  to allocate certain service company costs to affiliates 
the variation in operating income reflected in eliminations and other for keyspan s non operating subsidiaries between and primarily reflects an adjustment recorded in for environmental reserves associated with non utility environmental sites based on a recently concluded site investigation study 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies environmental matters for additional information on environmental issues 
in  these non operating subsidiaries realized operating income of million  primarily related to the million benefit associated with the favorable appellate court decision regarding the rico class action settlement  previously mentioned 
liquidity cash flow from operations for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the same period last year 
during  keyspan performed an analysis of costs capitalized for self constructed property and inventory for income tax purposes 
keyspan filed a change of accounting method for income tax purposes resulting in a cumulative deduction for costs previously capitalized 
as a result of this tax method change  along with accelerated deductions resulting from bonus depreciation  keyspan received in october  a million refund from the internal revenue service associated with the refund of prior year taxes  as well as an additional million for tax payments made in on a comparative basis  tax refunds received in coupled with tax payments made in  resulted in a cash flow benefit in  compared to  of approximately million 
comparative operating cash flow also reflects the collection of gas accounts receivable associated with higher winter gas heating sales 
as a result of load additions  colder than normal winter weather during the first quarter  higher natural gas prices  and higher accounts receivable at the end of  cash receipts from gas heating customers were higher in than in further  the higher natural gas prices resulted in an increase in operating cash flow associated with the operations of houston exploration 
these benefits to cash flow were partially offset by significantly higher cash expenditures to re fill natural gas storage levels as a result of the higher natural gas prices 
cash flow from operations decreased by million  or  in compared to operating cash flow from gas exploration and production activities was adversely impacted by significantly lower realized gas prices in further  cash flow from operations in reflects the funding of the pension obligations related to our new england subsidiaries of million 
these adverse effects on cash flow were partially offset by the termination of two interest rate swap agreements that resulted in a favorable operating cash flow benefit of approximately million  as well as lower income tax payments 
state and federal tax payments were lower in  compared to  as keyspan was in a refund position with regard to such taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  hedging  derivative financial instruments  and fair values for an explanation of the interest rate hedges 
at december   we had cash and temporary cash investments of million 
during  we repaid million of commercial paper and  at december   million of commercial paper was outstanding at a weighted average annualized interest rate of 
we had the ability to borrow up to an additional million at december   under the terms of our credit facility 
in  keyspan renewed its billion revolving credit facility  which was syndicated among sixteen banks 
the facility is used to support keyspan s commercial paper program  and consists of two separate credit facilities with different maturities but substantially similar terms and conditions a million facility that extends for days  and a million facility that is committed for three years 
the fees for the facilities are subject to a ratings based grid  with an annual fee that ranges from eight to twenty five basis points on the day facility and ten to twenty basis points on the three year facility 
both credit agreements allow for keyspan to borrow using several different types of loans  specifically  eurodollar loans  abr loans  or competitively bid loans 
eurodollar loans are based on the eurodollar rate plus a margin 
abr loans are based on the highest of the prime rate  the base cd rate plus  or the federal funds effective rate plus  plus a margin 
competitive bid loans are based on bid results requested by keyspan from the lenders 
the margins on both facilities are ratings based and range from zero basis points to basis points 
the margins are increased if outstanding loans are in excess of of the total facility 
in addition  the day facility has a one year term out option  which would cost an additional if utilized 
we do not anticipate borrowing against this facility  however  if the credit rating on our commercial paper program were to be downgraded  it may be necessary to do so 
the credit facility contains certain affirmative and negative operating covenants  including restrictions on keyspan s ability to mortgage  pledge  encumber or otherwise subject its property to any lien  as well as certain financial covenants that require us to  among other things  maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio of no more than 
violation of this covenant could result in the termination of the credit facility and the required repayment of amounts borrowed thereunder  as well as possible cross defaults under other debt agreements 
under the terms of the credit facility  keyspan s debt to total capitalization ratio reflects equity treatment for the meds equity units issued in at december   consolidated indebtedness  as calculated under the terms of the credit facility was of consolidated capitalization 
the leasing arrangement associated with the ravenswood facility master lease has always been treated as debt for the calculation of debt to total capitalization under keyspan s credit facility 
beginning on december   keyspan was required to consolidate the master lease agreement as required by fin and as a result the master lease agreement is reflected as debt on the consolidated balance sheet 
see the discussion under off balance sheet arrangements for an explanation of the master lease agreement 
the credit facility also requires that net cash proceeds from the sale of significant subsidiaries be applied to reduce consolidated indebtedness 
further  an acceleration of indebtedness of keyspan or one of its subsidiaries for borrowed money in excess of million in the aggregate  if not annulled within days after written notice  would create an event of default under the indenture dated november   between keyspan corporation and the jpmorganchase bank as trustee 
at december   keyspan was in compliance with all covenants 
houston exploration has a revolving credit facility with a commercial banking syndicate that provides houston exploration with a commitment of million  which can be increased at its option to a maximum of million with prior approval from the banking syndicate 
the credit facility is subject to borrowing base limitations  currently set at million and is re determined semi annually 
up to million of the borrowing base is available for the issuance of letters of credit 
the credit facility matures on july   is unsecured and  with the exception of trade payables  ranks senior to all existing debt of houston exploration

interest on fixed rate loans is payable at a fixed rate equal to the sum of a a quoted reserve adjusted libor rate  plus b a variable margin between and  depending on the amount of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
financial covenants require houston exploration to  among other things  i maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least to of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation ebitda to cash interest  ii maintain a total debt to ebitda ratio of not more than to  and iii generally prohibits the hedging of more than of natural gas and oil production during any month period 
at december   houston exploration was in compliance with all financial covenants 
during  houston exploration borrowed million under its credit facility and repaid million 
at december   houston exploration had million of borrowings outstanding under its credit facility at an average rate of 
in addition  million was committed under outstanding letters of credit obligations and million of borrowing capacity was available 
in  keyspan canada replaced its two outstanding credit facilities with one new facility with three tranches that combined allowed keyspan canada to borrow up to approximately million 
at the time of the partial sale of keyspan canada  net proceeds from the sale of million plus an additional million drawn under the new credit facilities were used to pay down existing outstanding debt of million 
during the third quarter of  keyspan canada issued cdn million  or approximately us million  in long term secured notes in a private placement 
the proceeds of the offering were used to pay down  in its entirety  outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
further  one tranch of the credit facility was discontinued 
see capital expenditures and financing financing below for further information regarding the long term debt issuance 
at december   keyspan canada s credit facility had the following two tranches with the following maturities i million matures in days and ii million matures in two years 
during  keyspan canada borrowed million from its prior credit facilities and repaid million 
during the fourth quarter of  keyspan canada borrowed million under the new facility and at december   million was available for future borrowing 
in  the boston gas company redeemed all  shares of its outstanding variable term cumulative preferred stock  series a at its par value of per share 
the total payment was million that included million of accumulated dividends 
this preferred stock series had been reflected as minority interest on keyspan s consolidated balance sheet 
on january   keyspan sold million shares of common stock on the open market and realized net proceeds of approximately million 
all shares were offered by keyspan pursuant to the effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
net proceeds from the equity sale were used to call million of outstanding promissory notes to lipa as is further explained in capital expenditures and financing below 
in addition  as previously noted  we used the net proceeds of approximately million received in connection with the partial monetization of houston exploration to repay short term debt 
a substantial portion of consolidated revenues are derived from the operations of businesses within the electric services segment  that are largely dependent upon two large customers lipa and the nyiso 
accordingly  our cash flows are dependent upon the timely payment of amounts owed to us by these customers 
we satisfy our seasonal working capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper 
we believe that these sources of funds are sufficient to meet our seasonal working capital needs 
capital expenditures and financing construction expenditures the table below sets forth our construction expenditures by operating segment for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands of dollars gas distribution   electric services   energy investments   energy services and other   construction expenditures related to the gas distribution segment are primarily for the renewal and replacement of mains and services and for the expansion of the gas distribution system 
construction expenditures for the electric services segment reflect costs to i maintain our generating facilities  ii expand the ravenswood facility  and iii construct new long island generating facilities as previously noted 
the decrease in electric services construction expenditures in  compared to last year reflects the fact that construction of the glenwood and port jefferson peaking facilities was substantially completed by june  construction expenditures related to the energy investments segment primarily reflect costs associated with gas exploration and production activities 
these costs are related to the exploration and development of properties primarily in southern louisiana and in the gulf of mexico 
expenditures also include development costs associated with the joint venture with houston exploration  as well as costs related to keyspan canada s gas processing facilities 
construction expenditures for are estimated to be approximately the same as at billion 
the amount of future construction expenditures is reviewed on an ongoing basis and can be affected by timing  scope and changes in investment opportunities 
financing in november  keyspan closed on a financing transaction pursuant to which million tax exempt bonds with a coupon maturing in june were issued on its behalf 
fifty three million dollars of these industrial development revenue bonds were issued through the nassau county industrial development authority for the construction of the glenwood electric generation peaking plant and the balance of million was issued by the suffolk county industrial development authority for the port jefferson electric generation peaking plant 
proceeds from the transaction were used to pay down commercial paper used for the construction  installation and equipping of the two facilities 
in  keyspan canada  issued cdn million  or approximately us million  long term secured notes in a private placement to investors in canada and the united states 
the notes were issued in the following three series i cdn million senior secured notes due  ii cdn million senior secured notes due  and iii cdn million senior secured notes due the proceeds of the offering were used to repay keyspan canada s credit facility 
in addition  houston exploration closed on a private placement issue of million  senior subordinated notes due interest payments began on december   and will be paid semi annually thereafter 
the notes will mature on june  houston exploration has the right to redeem the notes as of june   at a price equal to the issue price plus a specified redemption premium 
until june   houston exploration may also redeem up to of the notes at a redemption price of with proceeds from an equity offering 
houston exploration incurred approximately million of debt issuance costs on this private placement 
houston exploration used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance to redeem all of its outstanding million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due at a price of of par plus interest accrued to the redemption date 
debt redemption costs totaled approximately million 
the remaining net proceeds from the offering were used to reduce debt amounts associated with houston exploration s bank revolving credit facility 
we also issued million of medium term and long term debt in the debt was issued in the following two series i million notes due  and ii million notes due the proceeds of this issuance were used to pay down outstanding commercial paper 
in connection with the keyspan lilco business combination  keyspan and certain of its subsidiaries issued promissory notes to lipa to support certain debt obligations assumed by lipa 
at december   the remaining principal amount of promissory notes issued to lipa was approximately million 
under these promissory notes  keyspan is required to obtain letters of credit to secure its payment obligations if its long term debt is not rated at least in the a range by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating agencies 
in an effort to mitigate the dilutive effect of the equity issuance previously mentioned  in march  we called approximately million aggregate principal amount of such promissory notes at the applicable redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest through the dates of redemption 
interest savings associated with this redemption were million after tax  or per share  in in the fourth quarter of  keyspan received authorization from the sec  under puhca  to issue up to an additional billion of securities through december  this authorization provides keyspan with the necessary flexibility to finance our future capital requirements over the next three years 
see the discussion under the caption regulation and rate matters securities and exchange commission regulation for a further discussion of this approval 
we anticipate replacing outstanding commercial paper related to the construction of a new mw combined cycle generating facility at the ravenswood facility site with the proceeds from a proposed sale leaseback transaction anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements subsequent events for further details on this proposed transaction 
we will continue to evaluate our capital structure and financing strategy for and beyond 
we believe that our current sources of funding ie  internally generated funds  the issuance of additional securities as noted above  and the availability of commercial paper are sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future 
the following table represents the ratings of our long term debt at december  currently  standard poor s and moody s investor services ratings on keyspan s and its subsidiaries long term debt are on negative outlook 
moody s investor standard services poor s fitchratings keyspan corporation a a a kedny n a a a kedli a a a boston gas a a n a colonial gas a a n a electric generation a a n a off balance sheet arrangements variable interest entity we have an arrangement with a variable interest entity through which we lease a portion of the ravenswood facility 
we acquired the ravenswood facility  in part  through the variable interest entity from consolidated edison on june  for approximately million 
in order to reduce the initial cash requirements  we entered into a lease agreement the master lease with a variable interest unaffiliated financing entity that acquired a portion of the facility  three steam generating units  directly from consolidated edison and leased it to a keyspan subsidiary 
the variable interest unaffiliated financing entity acquired the property for million  financed with debt of million of capitalization and equity of million of capitalization 
monthly lease payments generally equal the monthly interest expense on the debt securities 
in december  keyspan implemented fin that required us to consolidate this variable interest entity and classify the master lease as million long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet 
further  we recorded an asset on the consolidated balance sheet for an amount substantially equal to the estimated fair market value of the leased assets at inception of the lease  less depreciation since that time 
as previously mentioned  under the terms of our credit facility the master lease has been considered debt in the ratio of debt to total capitalization since the inception of the lease and therefore  implementation of fin had no impact on our credit facility 
the interpretation also requires us to continue to depreciate the leased assets over their remaining economic lives 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for additional information regarding the leasing arrangement associated with the master lease agreement and fin implementation issues 
guarantees keyspan had a number of financial guarantees for its subsidiaries at december  keyspan has fully and unconditionally guaranteed i million of medium term notes issued by kedli  ii the obligations of keyspan ravenswood llc  the lessee under the million master lease agreement associated with the ravenswood facility  and iii the payment obligations of our subsidiaries related to million of tax exempt bonds issued through the nassau county and suffolk county industrial development authority for the construction of the glenwood and port jefferson electric generation peaking facilities 
the medium term notes  the master lease agreement and the tax exempt bonds are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
further  keyspan has guaranteed i up to million of surety bonds associated with certain construction projects currently being performed by subsidiaries within the energy services segment  ii certain supply contracts  margin accounts and purchase orders for certain subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of million  and iii million of subsidiary letters of credit 
the guarantee of the kedli medium term notes expires in  while the master lease agreement can be extended to the guarantee of the payment obligations of our subsidiaries related to the tax exempt financing extends to the other guarantees have terms that do not extend beyond and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
at this time  we have no reason to believe that our subsidiaries will default on their current obligations 
however  we cannot predict when or if any defaults may take place or the impact such defaults may have on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for additional information regarding keyspan s guarantees

the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the impact of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual effects on our financial position and results of operations may vary significantly from expected results if the judgments and assumptions underlying the estimates prove to be inaccurate 
the critical accounting policies requiring such subjectivity are discussed below 
percentage of completion percentage of completion accounting is a method of accounting for long term construction type contracts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  the method used for engineering and mechanical contracting revenue recognition by the energy services segment 
percentage of completion is measured principally by comparing the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are known 
application of percentage of completion accounting  results in the recognition of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts recorded within the consolidated balance sheet which arise when revenues have been recognized but the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of the contracts 
such amounts are recoverable from customers based on various measures of performance  including achievement of certain milestones  completion of specified units or completion of the contract 
due to uncertainties inherent within estimates employed to apply percentage of completion accounting  it is possible that estimates will be revised as project work progresses 
changes in estimates resulting in additional future costs to complete projects can result in reduced margins or loss contracts 
unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates  and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated recoverable amounts of recorded change orders and claims may be made in the near term 
application of percentage of completion accounting requires that the impact of those revised estimates be reported in the consolidated financial statements prospectively 
valuation of goodwill keyspan records goodwill on purchase transactions  representing the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
in testing for goodwill impairment under statement of financial accounting standards sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  significant reliance is placed upon a number of estimates regarding future performance that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management 
a change in the fair value of our investments could cause a significant change in the carrying value of goodwill 
the assumptions used to measure the fair value of our investments are the same as those used by us to prepare yearly operating segment and consolidated earnings and cash flow forecasts 
in addition  these assumptions are used to set yearly budgetary guidelines 
keyspan currently has billion of recorded goodwill  the majority of which is recorded in the gas distribution and energy investments segment  with approximately million recorded in the energy services segment 
as permitted under sfas  we can rely on our previous valuations for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met a the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination  and b the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin and there is no economic indication that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
in the case of the gas distribution and the energy investments segments  the above criteria have been met and therefore  there was no impairment to goodwill in in regard to the energy services segment  adverse economic conditions experienced in the construction industry in the northeastern united states during and its related impact on the operating results of this segment  prompted management to conduct an impairment test during the fourth quarter 
keyspan employed a combination of two methodologies in determining the fair value for its investment in the energy services segment  a market valuation approach and an income valuation approach 
a third party specialist was engaged to assist with the valuation and evaluate the reasonableness of key assumptions employed 
since the companies included in the energy services segment are not publicly traded  the market valuation approach was used to estimate their total enterprise value or aggregate potential market value 
under the market valuation approach  keyspan compared relevant financial information relating to the companies included in the energy services segment to the corresponding financial information for a peer group of companies in the specialty trade contracting sector of the construction industry 
the market valuation approach derived enterprise value to earnings before interest and taxes ev ebit multiples and enterprise value to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ev ebitda multiples 
though there are numerous multiples that can be used to value an individual firm  these multiples were selected since they offer the closest parallels to discounted cash flow valuation and are most appropriate for the energy services segment s market sector 
in addition to the market valuation approach  we also used an income valuation approach or discounted cash flow dcf valuation approach to estimate the fair market value for the companies included in the energy services segment 
under the income valuation approach  the fair value of a firm is obtained by discounting the sum of i the expected future cash flows to a firm  and ii the terminal value of a firm 
the discount factor used in the calculation is basically a firm s weighted average cost of capital 
keyspan was required to make certain significant assumptions in the income approach  specifically the weighted average cost of capital  short and long term growth rates and expected future cash flows 
the cash flow model is based on relevant industry forecasts projecting improved market conditions over the next five years  continued increases in business activity that are likely to result in backlog growth  and short and long term revenue and operating margin growth projections that management believes are reasonable given historical performance 
as a result of our valuation  management has determined that the fair value of the assets adequately exceeds their carrying value and no impairment charge is necessary 
management will continue to review and focus on our overall strategy for this business unit and accordingly will continue to evaluate the related carrying value of the goodwill 
while we believe that our assumptions are reasonable  actual results  however  may differ from our projections 
accounting for the effects of rate regulation on gas distribution operations the financial statements of the gas distribution segment reflect the ratemaking policies and orders of the new york public service commission nypsc  the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc  and the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte 
four of our six regulated gas utilities kedny  kedli  boston gas company and energynorth natural gas  inc are subject to the provisions of sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement recognizes the actions of regulators  through the ratemaking process  to create future economic benefits and obligations affecting rate regulated companies 
in separate merger related orders issued by the dte  the base rates charged by colonial gas company and essex gas company have been frozen at their current levels for ten year periods ending and  respectively 
due to the length of these base rate freezes  the colonial and essex gas companies had previously discontinued the application of sfas sfas allows for the deferral of expenses and income on the consolidated balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the rate setting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the consolidated statements of income of an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which the amounts are reflected in rates 
rate regulation is undergoing significant change as regulators and customers seek lower prices for utility service and greater competition among energy service providers 
in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover costs in the future  all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas in that event  a write down of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result 
if we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of sfas for any of our rate regulated subsidiaries  we would apply the provisions of sfas regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 
we estimate that the write off of our net regulatory assets at december  could result in a charge to net income of approximately million or per share  which would be classified as an extraordinary item 
in management s opinion  our regulated subsidiaries that currently are subject to the provisions of sfas will continue to be subject to sfas for the foreseeable future 
as is further discussed under the caption regulation and rate matters  in october the dte rendered its decision on the boston gas company s base rate case and performance based rate plan proposal submitted to the dte in april the dte approved a million increase in base revenues  as well as an allowed rate of return on equity of 
the dte also approved a performance based rate plan for up to ten years 
the rate plans previously in effect for kedny and kedli have expired 
the continued application of sfas to record the activities of these subsidiaries is contingent upon the actions of regulators with regard to future rate plans 
we are currently evaluating various options that may be available to us including  but not limited to  proposing new plans for kedny and kedli 
the ultimate resolution of any future rate plans could have a significant impact on the application of sfas to these entities and  accordingly  on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory environment 
pension and other postretirement benefits as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  postretirement benefits  keyspan participates in both non contributory defined benefit pension plans  as well as other post retirement benefit opeb plans collectively postretirement plans 
keyspan s reported costs of providing pension and opeb benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension and opeb costs collectively postretirement costs are impacted by actual employee demographics  the level of contributions made to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the provisions of these plans may also impact current and future postretirement costs 
postretirement costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including  anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the postretirement costs and benefit obligations 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over ten years 
certain gas distribution subsidiaries are subject to sfas  and  as a result  changes in postretirement expenses are deferred for future recovery from or refund to gas sales customers 
however  kedny  although subject to sfas  does not have a recovery mechanism in place for increases in postretirement costs 
further  changes in postretirement expenses associated with subsidiaries that service the lipa agreements are also deferred for future recovery from or refund to lipa 
for  the assumed long term rate of return on our postretirement plans assets was pre tax  net of expenses 
this is an appropriate long term expected rate of return on assets based on keyspan s investment strategy  asset allocation and the historical outperformance of equity investments over long periods of time 
the actual year compound annual rate of return for the keyspan plans is greater than 
keyspan s master trust investment allocation policy target is equity and fixed income 
at december   the actual investment allocation was equities  fixed income and cash 
in an effort to maximize plan performance  actual asset allocation will fluctuate from year to year depending on the then current economic environment 
during  keyspan conducted an asset liability study projecting asset returns and expected benefit payments over a year period 
based on the results  keyspan has developed a multiyear funding strategy for its postretirement plans 
keyspan believes that it is reasonable to assume assets can achieve or outperform the assumed long term rate of return with the target allocation as a result of historical outperformance of equity investments over long term periods 
a basis point increase or decrease in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets would have impacted expense by approximately million  before deferrals 
the year end december  assumed discount rate used to determine postretirement obligations was 
our discount rate assumption is based upon the current investment yield associated with rating agency indices that have high quality long term corporate bonds 
a basis point increase or decrease in the assumed year end discount rate would have had no impact on expense 
however  a basis point decrease in the assumed year end discount rate would result in the recording of an additional minimum pension liability 
a year end discount rate of would have required an additional million debit to other comprehensive income oci  net of tax and deferrals 
at january   the assumed discount rate used to determine postretirement obligations was 
a basis point increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate at the beginning of the year would have impacted expense by approximately million  before deferrals 
our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term outlook 
historically  we have funded our qualified pension plans in excess of the amount required to satisfy minimum erisa funding requirements 
at december   we had a funding credit balance in excess of the erisa minimum funding requirements and as a result keyspan was not required to make any contributions to its qualified pension plans in however  although we have presently exceeded erisa funding requirements  our pension plans  on an actuarial basis  are currently underfunded 
therefore  during keyspan contributed million to its postretirement plans 
for  keyspan expects to contribute a total of million to its funded and unfunded post retirement plans 
future funding requirements are heavily dependent on actual return on plan assets and prevailing interest rates 
full cost accounting our gas exploration and production subsidiaries use the full cost method to account for their natural gas and oil properties 
under full cost accounting  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of natural gas and oil reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool 
capitalized costs include costs of all unproved properties  internal costs directly related to natural gas and oil activities  and capitalized interest 
under full cost accounting rules  total capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling equal to the present value of future net revenues  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties less income tax effects the ceiling limitation 
a quarterly ceiling test is performed to evaluate whether the net book value of the full cost pool exceeds the ceiling limitation 
if capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less deferred taxes are greater than the discounted future net revenues or ceiling limitation  a write down or impairment of the full cost pool is required 
a write down of the carrying value of the full cost pool is a non cash charge that reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
the ceiling test is calculated using natural gas and oil prices in effect as of the balance sheet date  held constant over the life of the reserves 
our gas exploration and production subsidiaries use derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to hedge against the volatility of natural gas prices 
in accordance with current sec guidelines  these derivatives are included in the estimated future cash flows in the ceiling test calculation 
in calculating the ceiling test at december   our subsidiaries estimated that a full cost ceiling cushion existed  whereby the carrying value of the full cost pool was less that the ceiling limitation 
no write down is required when a cushion exists 
natural gas prices continue to be volatile and the risk that a write down to the full cost pool will be required increases when natural gas prices are depressed or if there are significant downward revisions in estimated proved reserves 
natural gas and oil reserve quantities represent estimates only 
under full cost accounting  reserve estimates are used to determine the full cost ceiling limitation  as well as the depletion rate 
houston exploration estimates its proved reserves and future net revenues using sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the date it makes the reserve estimates 
natural gas prices  which have fluctuated widely in recent years  affect estimated quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues 
any estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and their values are inherently uncertain  including many factors beyond our control 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in addition  estimates of reserves may be revised based upon actual production  results of future development and exploration activities  prevailing natural gas and oil prices  operating costs and other factors  which revision may be material 
reserve estimates are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the underlying assumptions 
actual future production may be materially different from estimated reserve quantities and the differences could materially affect future amortization of natural gas and oil properties 
valuation of derivative instruments we employ derivative instruments to manage commodity and financial market risk 
all of our derivative instruments  except for certain weather derivatives  are reported on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value in accordance with sfas  weather derivatives are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf none of keyspan s derivative instruments qualify as energy trading contracts as defined by current accounting literature 
for those derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges under sfas  which are the majority of keyspan s derivative instruments  changes in the market value are recorded in other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet  in line with effectiveness measurements and are recorded through earnings at the time of settlement 
hedge effectiveness is dependent upon various factors such as the use of hedge contracts with market points that are different from the underlying transaction  and to the extent hedge contracts are deemed ineffective  that portion will impact earnings 
additionally  we use derivative financial instruments to reduce cash flow variability associated with the purchase price for a portion of future natural gas purchases for our regulated gas distribution activities  the accounting for such derivative instruments is subject to sfas changes in the market value of these derivative instruments are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities  as appropriate  on the consolidated balance sheet 
keyspan s non regulated subsidiaries employ a limited number of financial derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas  and  therefore  changes in the market value of these derivative instruments are recorded through earnings 
when available  quoted market prices are used to record a derivative contract s fair value 
however market values for certain derivative contracts may not be readily available or determinable 
if no active market exists for a commodity  a specific contract type  or for the entire term of a contract s duration  fair values are based on pricing models 
such models employ matrix pricing based on contracts with similar terms and risks  including pricing based on broker quotes and industry publications 
keyspan validates its internally developed fair values by using forecasted market information and mathematical extrapolation techniques 
in addition  for hedges of forecasted transactions  keyspan estimates the expected future cash flows of the forecasted transactions  as well as evaluates the probability of occurrence and timing of such transactions 
changes in market conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events could affect the timing of recognition of changes in fair value of certain hedging derivatives 
see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments and fair values and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a further description of all our derivative instruments 
dividends we are currently paying a dividend at an annual rate of per common share 
our dividend policy is reviewed annually by the board of directors 
the amount and timing of all dividend payments is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon business conditions  results of operations  financial conditions and other factors 
based on currently foreseeable market conditions  we intend to maintain the annual dividend at the level 
pursuant to nypsc orders  the ability of kedny and kedli to pay dividends to keyspan is conditioned upon maintenance of a utility capital structure with debt not exceeding and  respectively  of total utility capitalization 
in addition  the level of dividends paid by both utilities may not be increased from current levels if a basis point penalty is incurred under the customer service performance program 
at the end of kedny s and kedli s most recent rate years september  and november   respectively  the ratio of debt to total utility capitalization was and  respectively 
additionally  we have met the requisite customer service performance standards 
our corporate and financial activities and those of each of our subsidiaries including their ability to pay dividends to us are also subject to regulation by the sec

regulation and rate matters gas distribution by orders dated february  and april   the nypsc approved the keyspan lilco business combination and established gas rates for both kedny and kedli 
pursuant to the orders  billion of efficiency savings  excluding gas costs  attributable to operating synergies that are expected to be realized over the ten year period following the combination  were allocated to customers  net of transaction costs 
effective may   kedny s base rates to core customers were reduced by million annually 
in addition  kedny is subject to an earnings sharing provision pursuant to which it is required to credit core customers with of any utility earnings up to basis points above certain threshold return on equity levels over the term of the rate plan other than any earnings associated with discrete incentives and of any utility earnings in excess of basis points above such threshold level 
the threshold level for the rate year ended september  was 
kedny did not earn above its threshold return level in its rate year ended september  on september   kedny s rate agreement with the nypsc expired 
under the terms of the agreement  the then current gas distribution rates and all other provisions  including the earnings sharing provision at the threshold level  remain in effect until changed by the nypsc 
at this time  we are currently evaluating various options that may be available to us regarding kedny s rates  including but not limited to  proposing a new rate plan 
the orders also required kedli to reduce base rates to its customers by million annually effective february  and by an additional million annually effective may  kedli is subject to an earnings sharing provision pursuant to which it is required to credit to firm customers of any utility earnings in any rate year up to basis points above a return on equity of and of any utility earnings in excess of a return on equity of

boston gas company  colonial gas company and essex gas company operations are subject to massachusetts s statutes applicable to gas utilities 
rates for gas sales and transportation service  distribution safety practices  issuance of securities and affiliate transactions are regulated by the dte 
regarding the boston gas company  we filed a base rate case and performance based rate plan on april   to be effective in the fourth quarter of on october   the dte rendered its decision on the boston gas company s proposal and approved a million increase in base revenues with an allowed return on equity of assuming an equal balance of debt and equity 
on january  the dte issued orders on boston gas company s motions for recalculation  reconsideration and clarification that granted an additional million in base revenues  for a total of million 
the dte also approved a true up mechanism for pension and other postretirement benefit costs under which variations between actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs and amounts used to establish rates are deferred and collected from or refunded to customers in subsequent periods through an adjustment clause 
this true up mechanism allows for carrying charges on deferred assets and liabilities at boston gas company s weighted average cost of capital 
the dte also approved a performance based rate plan the plan for up to ten years 
the plan allows for an annual revenue adjustment based on inflation  less a percent productivity factor 
further  the plan contained a margin sharing mechanism  whereby of earnings in excess of a return on equity will be passed back to customers 
similarly  ratepayers would absorb of any shortfall below a return on equity 
prior to the change in base rates and the new plan noted above  boston gas company s gas rates for local distribution service were governed by a five year performance based rate plan approved by the dte in the plan 
under this plan  boston gas company s rates for local distribution were recalculated annually to reflect inflation for the previous months  and reduced by a productivity factor of 
the productivity factor had been the subject of a remand proceeding at the dte 
with respect to this appeal  on march   the massachusetts supreme judicial court ruled in favor of boston gas company and reduced the productivity factor from to 
in connection with the eastern enterprises acquisition of colonial gas company in  the dte approved a merger and rate plan that resulted in a ten year freeze of base rates to colonial gas company s firm customers 
the base rate freeze is subject only to certain exogenous factors  such as changes in tax laws  accounting changes  or regulatory  judicial  or legislative changes 
the office of the attorney general appealed the dte s order to the supreme judicial court  which appeal is still pending 
due to the length of the base rate freeze  colonial gas company discontinued its application of sfas essex gas company is also under a ten year base rate freeze and has also discontinued its application of sfas energynorth natural gas  inc s base rates continue as set by the nhpuc in electric rate matters keyspan sells to lipa all of the capacity and  to the extent requested  energy conversion services from our existing long island based oil and gas fired generating plants 
sales of capacity and energy conversion services are made under rates approved by the ferc in accordance with the power supply agreement psa entered into between keyspan and lipa in the current ferc approved rates  which have been in effect since may  expired on december  keyspan filed with the ferc an updated cost of service for the long island based oil and gas fired generating plants in october the rate filing included  among other things  an annual revenue increase of or approximately million  a return on equity of  updated operating and maintenance expense levels and recovery of certain other costs 
ferc approved implementation of new rates starting january   subject to refund 
settlement negotiations are currently ongoing 
securities and exchange commission regulation keyspan and its subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec under puhca 
the rules and regulations under puhca generally limit the operations of a registered holding company to a single integrated public utility system  plus additional energy related businesses 
in addition  the principal regulatory provisions of puhca i regulate certain transactions among affiliates within a holding company system including the payment of dividends by such subsidiaries to a holding company  ii govern the issuance  acquisition and disposition of securities and assets by a holding company and its subsidiaries  iii limit the entry by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries into businesses other than electric and or gas utility businesses  and iv require sec approval for certain utility mergers and acquisitions 
the sec s order issued on december   provides us with  among other things  authorization to do the following through december  the authorization period a to issue and sell up to an additional amount of billion of common stock  preferred stock  preferred and equity linked securities  and long term debt securities the long term financing limit in accordance with certain defined parameters  b in addition to the long term financing limit  to issue and sell up to an aggregate amount of billion of short term debt the short term financing limit  c to issue up to million shares of common stock under dividend reinvestment and stock based management incentive and employee benefit plans  d to maintain existing and enter into additional hedging transactions with respect to outstanding indebtedness in order to manage and minimize interest rate costs  e to issue guarantees and other forms of credit support in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed billion outstanding at any one time  f to refund  repurchase through open market purchases  tender offers or private transactions  replace or refinance debt or equity securities outstanding during the authorization period through the issuance of similar or any other type of authorized securities  g to pay dividends out of capital and unearned surplus as well as paid in capital with respect to certain subsidiaries  subject to certain limitations  h to engage in preliminary development activities and administrative and management activities in connection with anticipated investments in exempt wholesale generators  foreign utility companies and other energy related companies  i to organize and or acquire the equity securities of entities that will serve the purpose of facilitating authorized financings  j to invest up to billion in exempt wholesale generators and foreign utility companies  k to create and or acquire the securities of entities organized for the purpose of facilitating investments in other non utility subsidiaries  and l to enter into certain types of affiliate transactions between certain non utility subsidiaries involving cost structures above the typical at cost limit 
in addition  we have committed that during the authorization period  our common equity will be at least of our consolidated capitalization and each of our utility subsidiaries common equity will be at least of such entity s capitalization 
as of december  our consolidated common equity was of our consolidated capitalization  including commercial paper  and each of our utility subsidiaries common equity was at least of its respective capitalization 
electric services revenue mechanisms lipa agreements keyspan  through certain of its subsidiaries  provides services to lipa under the following agreements management services agreement msa keyspan manages the day to day operations  maintenance and capital improvements of the transmission and distribution t d system 
lipa exercises control over the performance of the t d system through specific standards for performance and incentives 
in exchange for providing the services  we earn a million annual management fee and are operating under a contract  which provides certain incentives and imposes certain penalties based upon performance 
we have reached an agreement with lipa to extend the msa for months through  as discussed under the heading generation purchase right agreement below 
annual service incentives or penalties exist under the msa if certain targets are achieved or not achieved 
in addition  we can earn certain incentives for budget underruns associated with the day to day operations  maintenance and capital improvements of lipa s t d system 
these incentives provide for us to i retain on the first million in annual budget underruns  and ii retain of additional annual underruns up to of the total cost budget  thereafter all savings accrue to lipa 
with respect to cost overruns  we will absorb the first million of overruns  with a sharing of overruns above million 
there are certain limitations on the amount of cost sharing of overruns 
to date  we have performed our obligations under the msa within the agreed upon budget guidelines and we are committed to providing on going services to lipa within the established cost structure 
however  no assurances can be given as to future operating results under this agreement 
power supply agreement psa keyspan sells to lipa all of the capacity and  to the extent requested  energy conversion services from our existing long island based oil and gas fired generating plants 
sales of capacity and energy conversion services are made under rates approved by the ferc 
as noted previously  rates under the psa have been reestablished for the contract year commencing january  rates charged to lipa include a fixed and variable component 
the variable component is billed to lipa on a monthly per megawatt hour basis and is dependent on the number of megawatt hours dispatched 
lipa has no obligation to purchase energy conversion services from us and is able to purchase energy or energy conversion services on a least cost basis from all available sources consistent with existing interconnection limitations of the t d system 
the psa provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for the maintenance of the output capability and the efficiency of the generating facilities 
the psa runs for a term of fifteen years through may  with lipa having the option to renew the psa for an additional fifteen year term 
energy management agreement ema the ema provides for keyspan to procure and manage fuel supplies on behalf of lipa to fuel the generating facilities under contract to it and perform off system capacity and energy purchases on a least cost basis to meet lipa s needs 
in exchange for these services we earn an annual fee of million 
in addition  we arrange for off system sales on behalf of lipa of excess output from the generating facilities and other power supplies either owned or under contract to lipa 
lipa is entitled to two thirds of the profit from any off system energy sales 
in addition  the ema provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for performance related to fuel purchases and off system power purchases 
the ema is expected to be in effect through for the procurement of fuel supplies and through for off system management services 
under these agreements  we are required to obtain a letter of credit in the aggregate amount of million supporting our obligations to provide the various services if our long term debt is not rated in the a range by a nationally recognized rating agency 
generation purchase right agreement gpra under the gpra  lipa originally had the right for a one year period beginning on may   to acquire all of our long island based generating assets formerly owned by lilco at fair market value at the time of the exercise of such right 
by agreement dated march   lipa and keyspan amended the gpra to provide for a new six month option period ending on may  the other terms of the option reflected in the gpra remained unchanged 
in return for providing lipa an extension of the gpra  keyspan has been provided with a corresponding extension of months for the msa to the end of the extension is the result of an initiative established by lipa to work with keyspan and others to review long island s long term energy needs 
lipa and keyspan will jointly analyze new energy supply options including re powering existing plants  renewable energy technologies  distributed generation  conservation initiatives and retail competition 
the extension allows both lipa and keyspan to explore alternatives to the gpra including re powering existing facilities  the sale of some or all of keyspan s plants to lipa  or the sale of some or all of these plants to other investor owned entities 
keyspan glenwood and port jefferson energy centers keyspan glenwood energy center llc and keyspan port jefferson energy center llc have entered into year power purchase agreements the ppas with lipa 
under the terms of the ppas  these subsidiaries sell capacity  energy conversion services and ancillary services to lipa 
both plants are designed to produce megawatts 
under the ppas  lipa pays a monthly capacity fee  which guarantees full recovery of each plant s construction costs  as well as an appropriate rate of return on investment 
the ppas also obligate lipa to pay for each plant s costs of operation and maintenance 
these costs are billed on a monthly estimated basis and are subject to true up for actual costs incurred 
ravenswood facility we currently sell capacity  energy and ancillary services associated with the ravenswood facility through a bidding process into the nyiso energy markets on both a day ahead and a real time basis 
we also have the ability to enter into bilateral transactions to sell all or a portion of the energy produced by the ravenswood facility to load serving entities  ie entities that sell to end users or to brokers and marketers 
environmental matters keyspan is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulatory programs related to the environment 
during  we undertook an extensive review of all our current and former properties that are or may be subject to environmental cleanup activities 
as a result of this study  we adjusted reserve balances for estimated manufactured gas plant mgp related environmental cleanup activities  as well as estimated environmental cleanup costs related to three non utility sites 
through various rate orders issued by the nypsc  dte and nhpuc  costs related to mgp environmental cleanup activities are recovered in rates charged to gas distribution customers and  as a result  adjustments to these reserve balances do not impact earnings 
however  environmental cleanup activities related to the three non utility sites are not subject to rate recovery 
based on the recently concluded environmental study we reduced our reserve balance for future cleanup costs related to these sites and realized a pre tax operating income benefit of million 
we estimate that the remaining cost of our mgp related environmental cleanup activities  including costs associated with the ravenswood facility  will be approximately million and we have recorded a related liability for such amount 
we have also recorded an additional million liability  representing the estimated environmental cleanup costs related to a former coal tar processing facility 
as of december   we have expended a total of million on environmental investigation and remediation activities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations  guarantees and contingencies for a further explanation of these matters 
market and credit risk management activities market risk keyspan is exposed to market risk arising from potential changes in one or more market variables  such as energy commodity price risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  volumetric risk due to weather or other variables 
such risk includes any or all changes in value whether caused by commodity positions  asset ownership  business or contractual obligations  debt covenants  exposure concentration  currency  weather  and other factors regardless of accounting method 
we manage our exposure to changes in market prices using various risk management techniques for non trading purposes  including hedging through the use of derivative instruments  both exchange traded and over the counter contracts  purchase of insurance and execution of other contractual arrangements 
credit risk keyspan is exposed to credit risk arising from the potential that our counterparties fail to perform on their contractual obligations 
our credit exposures are created primarily through the sale of gas and transportation services to residential  commercial  electric generation  and industrial customers and the provision of retail access services to gas marketers  by our regulated gas businesses  the sale of commodities and services to lipa and the nyiso  the sale of gas  power and services to our retail customers by our unregulated energy service businesses  entering into financial and energy derivative contracts with energy marketing companies and financial institutions  and the sale of gas  natural gas liquids  oil and processing services to energy marketing and oil and gas production companies 
we have regional concentration of credit risk due to receivables from residential  commercial and industrial customers in new york  new hampshire and massachusetts  although this credit risk is spread over a diversified base of residential  commercial and industrial customers 
customers payment records are monitored and action is taken  when appropriate 
companies within the energy services segment have a concentration of credit risk to large customers and to the governmental and healthcare industries 
we also have concentrations of credit risk from lipa  our largest customer  and from other energy companies 
concentration of energy company counterparties may impact overall exposure to credit risk in that our counterparties may be similarly impacted by changes in economic  regulatory or other considerations 
we actively monitor the credit profile of our wholesale counterparties in derivative and other contractual arrangements  and manage our level of exposure accordingly 
over the past year  the credit quality of certain energy companies has declined 
in instances where counterparties credit quality has declined  we may limit our credit exposure by restricting new transactions with the counterparty  requiring additional collateral or credit support and negotiating the early termination of certain agreements 
equity and debt securities risk keyspan is exposed to price risk due to investments in equity and debt securities held to fund benefit payments for various employee pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
to the extent that the values of investments held decline  the effect will be reflected in keyspan s recognition of periodic cost of such employee benefit plans and the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans 
regulatory issues and competitive environment we are subject to various other risk exposures and uncertainties associated with our gas and electric operations 
the most significant contingency involves the evolution of the gas distribution and electric industries towards more competitive and deregulated environments 
set forth below is a description of these exposures 
the gas industry long island and new york the nypsc continues to conduct collaborative proceedings on ways to develop the competitive energy market in new york 
on july   the presiding officers in the case issued their recommended decision rd 
the rd recommends that the nypsc adopt an end state vision that includes removing the utilities from the provision of the energy gas and electric commodity 
the rd also recommends that utilities exit the commodity function only where there is a workably competitive market 
the rd states that the only market that is currently workably competitive is the commodity market for non residential large use gas customers 
parties filed briefs on and opposing exceptions to the rd 
on january   the nypsc issued a notice seeking further comments on the matters addressed in the rd  in light of the current state of the retail market and the experience of the past few years 
on may   the nypsc issued an order adopting terms of gas restructuring joint proposal petition of keyspan energy delivery new york and keyspan energy delivery long island for a multi year restructuring agreement joint proposal 
the joint proposal did not alter base rate levels  but established a merchant function backout credit of 
dth and 
dth for kedny and kedli  respectively 
these credits are designed to lower transportation rates charged to transportation only customers 
these credits were based on established levels of projected avoided costs and levels of customer migration to non utility commodity service 
lost revenues resulting from application of these credits will be recovered from firm gas sales customers 
the joint proposal expired on november  however  by order dated november  the nypsc approved tariff amendments that allow kedny and kedli to continue the merchant function backout credit and the lost revenue recovery mechanism through may  as a result of circumstances in  including the california energy crisis and the bankruptcy of enron corp  state regulators around the country are reassessing the pace of movement toward deregulation 
we are unable to predict the outcome or pace of this trend or its ultimate effect on our results of operation  financial condition or cash flows 
on december   new york state governor george pataki signed into law the energy consumer protection act of act 
the act defines energy services companies that provide gas or electric commodity service to customers as utilities subject to the home energy fair practices act provisions hefpa of the new york public service law 
under the act  in certain circumstances utilities such as kedny and kedli will be required to suspend distribution service to customers whose commodity service has been terminated by an energy services company 
generally  those energy services companies are required under the act to provide these customers with the same consumer protections prescribed under hefpa as are prescribed for full service sales customers of gas distribution companies 
those consumer protections include a series of notices warning of potential service termination  offering deferred payment agreements  and special protections for elderly  blind and disabled customers 
pursuant to the act  the nypsc proposed regulations implementing the act through a notice of proposed rulemaking dated january  the act became effective on june  we cannot predict the impact of the act on keyspan s regulated or unregulated operations at this time 
new england in july  the dte directed massachusetts gas distribution companies to undertake a collaborative process with other stakeholders to develop common principles under which comprehensive gas service unbundling might proceed 
a settlement agreement by the local distribution companies ldcs and the marketer group regarding model terms and conditions for unbundled transportation service was approved by the dte in november in february  the dte issued its order on how unbundling of natural gas service will proceed 
for a five year transition period  the dte determined that ldc contractual commitments to upstream capacity will be assigned on a mandatory  pro rata basis to marketers selling gas supply to the ldcs customers 
the approved mandatory assignment method eliminates the possibility that the costs of upstream capacity purchased by the ldcs to serve firm customers will be absorbed by the ldc or other customers through the transition period 
the dte also found that  through the transition period  ldcs will retain primary responsibility for upstream capacity planning and procurement to assure that adequate capacity is available to support customer requirements and growth 
the dte approved the ldcs terms and conditions of distribution service that conform to the settled upon model terms and conditions 
since november   all massachusetts gas customers have the option to purchase their gas supplies from third party sources other than the ldcs 
further  the new hampshire public utility commission required gas utilities to offer transportation services to all commercial and residential customers starting november  in january  the dte began a proceeding to re examine whether the upstream capacity market has been sufficiently competitive to allow voluntary capacity assignment 
we believe that the actions described above strike a balance among competing stakeholder interests in order to most effectively make available the benefits of the unbundled gas supply market to all customers 
electric industry the ravenswood facility and our new york city operations the nyiso s new york city local reliability rules currently require that of the electric capacity needs of new york city be provided by in city generators 
as additional  more efficient electric power plants are built in new york city and the surrounding areas  the requirement that of in city load be served by in city generators could be modified 
construction of new transmission facilities could also cause significant changes to the market 
if generation and or transmission facilities are constructed  and or the availability of our ravenswood facility deteriorates  then the capacity and energy sales volumes could be adversely affected 
we cannot predict  however  when or if new power plants or transmission facilities will be built or the nature of future new york city energy requirements or market design 
regional transmission organizations and standard market design during  the ferc issued several orders and began several proceedings related to the development of regional transmission organizations rto and the design of the wholesale energy markets 
on september   ferc terminated various rto proceedings  including the nyiso isone proceeding  because it determined their continuation is no longer necessary to achieve the commission s objective of establishing rtos 
nevertheless  the commission continues to guide the evolution of competitive markets in other proceedings including the development of a standard market design 
on july   ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr intended to establish a standardized national market design and rules for competitive wholesale electric markets standard market design or smd 
these rules would apply to transmission owners tos  independent system operators isos  and rtos 
the smd is intended to create i genuine wholesale competition  ii efficient transmission systems  iii the right pricing signals for investment in transmission and generation facilities  and iv more customer options 
how the smd will be implemented will be based on ferc s final rules in this regard  as well as the subject of various compliance filings by tos  isos  and rtos 
we do not know how the markets will develop nor how these proposed changes will impact the operations of the nyiso or its market rules 
furthermore  we are unable to determine to what extent  if any  this process will impact the ravenswood facility s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
new york independent system operator matters on may   ferc approved the nyiso s mitigation plan the plan 
the plan retains existing mitigation measures such as  mwhr energy price caps  non spinning reserve bid caps  in city capacity and energy mitigation measures  the day ahead automated mitigation procedure amp  and the nyiso s general mitigation authority 
in addition  the plan implemented a new in city real time automated mitigation procedure 
on november   the nyiso filed with ferc a request for tariff revisions reflecting the implementation of enhanced real time scheduling software 
among other things  the new software included changes to the in city day ahead energy mitigation measures 
the in city day ahead energy mitigation will no longer use the indian point price as a proxy for determining whether an energy offer should be mitigated 
the nyiso is going to apply its conduct and impact mitigation scheme to in city offers 
this will be applied on an hour by hour basis rather than on a hour basis 
overall the changes are intended to address longstanding issues in the nyiso market and help the nyiso markets reach their full potential 
the revisions are expected to lead to prices that reflect actual market and system conditions  including scarcity conditions 
ferc approved the tariff revisions on february  and the nyiso will implement the revisions when they complete testing of the software revisions in the fall of however  the nyiso will implement the revisions associated with the in city mitigation measures in its existing systems before the summer of although prices for various energy products in the nyiso markets have softened  it is not known to what extent each of these proceedings and revised rules may impact the ravenswood facility s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
nyiso demand curve capacity market implementation on march  the nyiso made a filing at ferc seeking approval of a demand curve to be used in place of its current deficiency auction for capacity procurement 
on may   ferc approved  with some modifications  the demand curve to become effective may  on october   ferc denied various requests for rehearing of its order approving the demand curve and approved the nyiso s compliance filing 
on december   the nyiso filed its first status report with ferc with respect to how the demand curve was working 
the nyiso report found that there was no evidence of inappropriate withholding of capacity resources and that the demand curve was working as intended 
on december   the electric consumers resource council filed an appeal with the dc circuit court of appeals of ferc s may  order approving the demand curve and its october  order denying rehearing 
this case is still pending and we are unable to determine to what extent  if any  this proceeding will impact the ravenswood facility s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
minute non spinning reserves dc court of appeals due to volatility in the market clearing price of minute spinning and non spinning reserves during the first quarter of  the nyiso requested that ferc approve a bid cap on reserves as well as requiring a refunding of so called alleged excess payments received by sellers  including ravenswood 
on may   ferc issued an order that granted approval of a per mwh bid cap for minute non spinning reserves  plus payments for the opportunity cost of not making energy sales 
the other requests  such as a bid cap for spinning reserves  retroactive refunds  recalculation of reserve prices for march  and convening a technical conference and settlement proceeding  were rejected 
the nyiso  con edison  niagara mohawk power corporation and rochester gas and electric joint petitioners each individually appealed ferc s order to federal court 
the appeals were consolidated into one case by the court 
on november  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia the court issued its decision in the case of consolidated edison company of new york  inc  v 
federal energy regulatory commission decision 
essentially  the court found errors in the commission s decision and remanded some issues in the case back to the commission for further explanation and action 
the commission has not acted on the remand 
at this time we can not predict the outcome of the remand proceeding 
foreign currency fluctuations we follow the principles of sfas  foreign currency translation for recording our investments in foreign affiliates 
at december   the net assets of these affiliates was approximately million and at december   the accumulated after tax foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income was a credit of million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financially settled commodity derivative instruments non regulated hedging activities from time to time  keyspan subsidiaries have utilized derivative financial instruments  such as futures  options and swaps  for the purpose of hedging the cash flow variability associated with changes in commodity prices 
keyspan is exposed to commodity price risk primarily with regard to its gas exploration and production activities and its electric generating facilities 
derivative financial instruments are employed by houston exploration to hedge cash flow variability associated with forecasted sales of natural gas 
the ravenswood facility uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the cash flow variability associated with the purchase of natural gas and oil that will be consumed during the generation of electricity 
the ravenswood facility also hedges the cash flow variability associated with a portion of peak electric energy sales 
for derivative instruments associated with gas exploration and production activities  keyspan uses standard new york mercantile exchange nymex future price quotes to value swap positions and published volatility in its black scholes calculation for outstanding options 
further  keyspan uses standard nymex futures prices to value gas futures contracts and market quoted forward prices to value oil swap and natural gas basis swap contracts associated with its ravenswood facility 
we also use market quoted forward prices to value electric derivatives associated with the ravenswood facility

the accounting for these derivative instruments is subject to sfas accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these derivatives have been recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
gains or losses on the settlement of these contracts are initially deferred and then refunded to or collected from our firm gas sales customers consistent with regulatory requirements
