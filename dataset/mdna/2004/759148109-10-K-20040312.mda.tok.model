item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  we derived our revenue from two business segments program management services and healthcare staffing 
our program management services segment includes inpatient programs including acute rehabilitation and skilled nursing units  outpatient therapy programs and contract therapy programs 
on february   we consummated the sale of our starmed staffing division to intelistaf holdings  inc and received approximately of the equity of intelistaf in return 
after the consummation date  the financial condition and results of operations of the staffing division will no longer be consolidated in our financial statements and our interest in intelistaf will be accounted for under the equity method 
summarized information about our revenues and earnings from operations in each segment is provided below 
year ended december  in thousands revenues from unaffiliated customers healthcare staffing    program management hospital rehabilitation services    contract therapy    program management total    less intercompany revenues  total    operating earnings loss healthcare staffing    program management hospital rehabilitation services    contract therapy    program management total    restructuring charge  total    intercompany revenues represent sales at market rates from our former healthcare staffing segment to our program management segment 
operating earnings for have been adjusted to reflect the corporate expense allocation methodology utilized in and the operating loss for healthcare staffing contains a million loss to state net assets and liabilities held for sale at their fair value less costs to sell 
revenues we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees paid directly by healthcare providers rather than through payment or reimbursement by government or other third party payers 
our inpatient and outpatient therapy programs are typically provided through agreements with hospital clients with three to five year terms 
our contract therapy and temporary healthcare staffing services are typically provided under interim or short term agreements with hospitals and skilled nursing facilities 
as a provider of healthcare staffing and program management services  our revenues and growth are affected by trends and developments in healthcare spending 
over the last three years  our revenues and earnings from our program management services have been negatively impacted by an aggregate decline in average billable lengths of stay 
the decline in average billable lengths of stay reflects the continued trend of reduced rehabilitation lengths of stay 
going forward  we have minimized our exposure to revenue decreases as a result of decreased lengths of stay through restructuring our contracting philosophy to primarily base our payments on number of discharges multiplied by a per discharge rate 
this methodology is similar to that of our clients who bill the various payers 
material changes in the rates or methods of government reimbursements to our clients for services rendered in the programs that we manage could give our clients the right to renegotiate their existing contracts with us to include terms that are less favorable to us 
for example  outpatient therapy programs receive payment from the medicare program under a fee schedule 
during  the contract therapy division was subject to therapy caps from september through december  experiencing decreases in revenues and profits as a result 
under current law  an outpatient therapy program that is not designated as being provider based is subject to an annual limit on payments for therapy services provided to medicare beneficiaries  however  these limits have been suspended through december  see discussion under item business government regulation provider based rules 
in addition  changes in the rates or methods of government reimbursements or changes to conditions of participation resulting from the rule could negatively impact the benefits that we are able to provide to our clients 
we are unable to predict with certainty the impact of any future changes  and we may experience a decline in our revenue and earnings as a result of any future changes to the prospective payment system or from any other changes in the rates or methods of government reimbursements

the consulting agreement with the former ceo continues his monthly compensation and car allowance of approximately  in addition  we incurred higher legal fees during to research and comment on the centers for medicare and medicaid services proposed rule

as a result of the restructuring plan  we recognized a pretax restructuring charge of million 
included in this restructuring charge is million of severance and outplacement costs and million for exit costs related to the closing of five starmed branches 
the restructuring charge is reflected as a separate component of costs and expenses for on december   we announced that we had entered into a stock purchase and sale agreement with intelistaf pursuant to which intelistaf would acquire our healthcare staffing division in exchange for approximately of the common stock of intelistaf on a fully diluted basis

the amounts are held in trust in designated investments and remain our property until distribution

at december   we owned trust assets with a value approximately equal to the total amount of this obligation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed and will continue to discuss its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and establishing accruals for known and incurred but not reported health  workers compensation and professional liability claims 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances 
we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectability of specific accounts  historical experience and the aging of the accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze customers with historical poor payment history and customer credit worthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and make adjustments in the periods any excess or shortfall is identified 
goodwill and other intangibles 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets  both tangible and intangible  based on estimated fair values 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed  is recorded as goodwill 
prior to january   goodwill relating to acquisitions was amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
the amortization periods differed depending on whether the acquired entity was national in scope or a regional provider 
goodwill related to the acquisition of a national provider was amortized over years  while goodwill related to a regional provider was amortized over years 
on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under statement no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized and must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
if the impairment test indicates that the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss would be recognized in the statement of earnings in an amount equal to the excess carrying value 
on december   we announced that we had entered into a stock purchase and sale agreement with intelistaf pursuant to which intelistaf would acquire our healthcare staffing division  in exchange for approximately of the common stock of intelistaf on a fully diluted basis 
this transaction subsequently closed on february  in accordance with the requirements of statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the assets and liabilities of our healthcare staffing operation are reported on our december  consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities held for sale and have been measured at their net fair value less estimated costs to sell 
we recognized an impairment loss of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill associated with the staffing division and to accrue estimated selling costs 
this impairment loss was computed in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
we engaged a third party valuation firm to assist us in determining the fair value of consideration given and received in the contemplated transaction with intelistaf 
this value  less estimated costs to sell  was compared to the carrying value of the healthcare staffing division to ascertain if any impairment existed 
because the estimated fair value less costs to sell was less than the carrying value of the staffing business  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the implied fair value of goodwill and in turn the amount of impairment 
the impairment loss has been recorded as a separate component of costs and expenses in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december  as required by statement no 
 we also conducted an annual impairment assessment of goodwill related to our hospital rehabilitation services and contract therapy businesses and determined that goodwill is not impaired 
the test required comparison of the estimated fair value of these businesses to our book value 
the estimated fair value was based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as economic trends and government regulations  and internal factors such as changes in our forecasts or in our business strategies 
we believe the assumptions used in our impairment analysis are reasonable and appropriate  however  different assumptions and estimates could affect the results of our impairment analysis and in turn result in an impairment charge 
if an impairment loss should occur in the future  it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
at december   unamortized goodwill related to our hospital rehabilitation services and contract therapy businesses was million and million  respectively 
health  workers compensation  and professional liability insurance accrual 
we maintain an accrual for our health  workers compensation and professional liability claim costs that are partially self insured and are classified in accrued salaries and wages health insurance and accrued expenses workers compensation and professional liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the combined amount of these accruals was approximately million 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation  and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
in analyzing the accruals  we also consider the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals 
while we believe that the recorded amounts are appropriate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our hospitals and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our borrowing capacity consists of a line of credit with interest rates that fluctuate based upon market indexes 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
as such  risk relating to interest fluctuation is considered minimal
