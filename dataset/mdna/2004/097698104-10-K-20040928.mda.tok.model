item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion includes forward looking statements about the demand for our products and future results 
please refer to the note regarding forward looking statements section of this form k 
overview sales of the company s geophysical products are generally related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and development activity which is dependent  primarily  on oil and gas prices 
during fiscal  despite high oil and gas prices  the energy industry became increasingly more cautious on marine seismic exploration spending 
this slowdown in marine seismic activity was industry wide 
during fiscal  the company did not ship any complete energy source systems until late in the fourth quarter  and sales of air gun replacement parts and underwater electrical connectors were depressed 
because of the slowdown in marine seismic activity  seismic contractors significantly reduced the size of their fleets 
such fleet contraction has resulted in lower sales of geophysical equipment  including the company s air guns and underwater connectors 
although marine seismic exploration activity continues to be depressed  there has been improvement during fiscal based on the high price of oil and increased worldwide energy demand  proposals that the company has outstanding and the current level of customer inquiries  the company currently anticipates marine seismic exploration activity to continue to improve into fiscal sales in the industrial products segment improved during fiscal reflecting the continuing improvement in the us economy resulting in the addition of new customers and higher volume from existing customers 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company considers current cash and cash equivalent balances and projected cash flow from operations adequate to meet foreseeable operating needs 
however  as discussed below under year ended june   in the event the company exercises the option for the purchase of the land and building in cypress  texas  the company may consider obtaining financing for such purchase 
year ended june  at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended june   cash and cash equivalents increased by  cash flow from operating activities after changes in operating assets and liabilities was  for the year ended june   primarily due to net income adjusted for depreciation and deferred income taxes partially offset by higher accounts receivable 
for the year ended june   the company used  for capital expenditures funded from operating cash flow 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for fiscal year will be approximately  the company expects to fund these capital expenditures from operating cash flow 
the company has an option to purchase the land and building in cypress  texas where a g is located for  the option expires in april of  concurrent with the present lease expiration date 
the company currently believes that it will exercise the purchase option prior to its expiration date 
in this regard  the company is considering  among other things  when it will exercise the option and how it will fund the exercise price 
should external financing for all or a portion of the exercise price be deemed appropriate  the company believes that it could obtain such financing at competitive terms 

table of contents since a relatively small number of customers account for the majority of the company s geophysical equipment sales  the consolidated accounts receivable balance tends to be concentrated in a small number of customers 
at june  and  the five customers with the highest balances due represented and  respectively  of the accounts receivable balances on those dates 
year ended june  at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended june   cash and cash equivalents increased by  cash flow from operating activities after changes in operating assets and liabilities was  for the year ended june   primarily due to a decrease in the level of accounts receivable partially offset by the fiscal net loss  higher inventories and lower accrued liabilities 
for the year ended june   the company used  for capital expenditures 
in may  the company entered into a one year  unsecured line of credit agreement with a bank to support working capital requirements 
the company never borrowed under this facility which expired in may in october  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the company was authorized to buy up to  shares of its common stock in open market or private transactions

table of contents results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales for the year ended june  increased by  or  from the year ended june  sales of geophysical equipment increased by  or primarily due to several complete energy source systems sales of traditional guns which amounted to  and the first sale of the company s annular port guns which amounted to  the remainder of the increase was attributable to higher sales of air gun replacement parts and underwater electrical connectors reflecting increased marine seismic activity 
in contrast  sales of complete energy source systems sales during year ended june  amounted to only  industrial products sales for the year ended june  increased by  or from the year ended june  primarily reflecting higher volume associated with the gradual improvement in the domestic economy and the addition of new customers 
consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of consolidated sales was for the year ended june  versus for the year ended june  cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the geophysical segment decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   due primarily to higher manufacturing efficiencies associated with the sales increase 
increases to the inventory valuation reserve in fiscal and were  and  respectively 
these amounts were charged to cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the industrial products segment increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  due primarily to higher compensation costs 
research and development expense in fiscal was  more than in the prior fiscal year  reflecting work on the development of a new product  the seismic source monitoring system  and a reduction in spending on the annular port gun project 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or for the year ended june  versus the year ended june   primarily due to increased bad debt expense  and higher professional fees 
higher professional fees relate primarily to costs associated with the securities and exchange commission s informal inquiry 
the company conducted  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  an annual impairment test of goodwill balances as of july  and the results of these tests indicated that there was no impairment of the july  and goodwill balances 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was  an effective tax rate of  which was higher than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the effect of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses  partially offset by exempt income relating to foreign sales 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was a benefit of  reflecting a loss before income taxes of  and an increase in net deferred tax assets partially offset by state income taxes 
the above mentioned factors resulted in a net income for the year ended june  of  compared to net loss of  for the year ended june  
table of contents year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales for the year ended june  decreased by  or  from the year ended june  sales of geophysical equipment decreased by  or  reflecting the industry wide slowdown in marine seismic activity due to cautious exploration spending by energy companies which  in turn  resulted in lower demand for air guns  air gun replacement parts and underwater connectors by seismic marine exploration contractors  which are the company s major customers 
this decrease was partially offset by a  or increase in sales of industrial products compared to the year ended june   as that business began to show improvement from the prior year due to improved conditions in the domestic economy 
with such improvement  this segment was able to add new customers and achieve higher sales volumes from existing customers 
consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of consolidated sales increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to the geophysical equipment segment 
cost of sales for the geophysical equipment segment increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   due primarily to lower manufacturing efficiencies associated with the sales decrease mentioned above 
in addition  cost of sales for the geophysical equipment segment for the year ended june  includes a charge of  to increase the inventory valuation reserve to recognize that the current supply of certain inventory items exceeds estimated future demand resulting from the industry wide slowdown in marine seismic activity during the year ended june  there was no increase to the inventory valuation reserve during the year ended june  cost of sales for the industrial products segment decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  reflecting slightly higher manufacturing efficiencies resulting from the increase in sales 
research and development expense decreased by  or for fiscal year over fiscal year because a major research and development program  the apg gun  reached near completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or for the year ended june  versus the year ended june   primarily due to lower compensation costs  and lower bad debt expense 
the company conducted  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  an annual impairment test of goodwill balances as of july  and the results of these tests indicated that there was no impairment of the july  and goodwill balances 
interest expense for the year ended june  was zero versus  for the year ended june  the reason for this decrease was the payment in full in april of the note issued in connection with the a g geophysical products  inc acquisition 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was a benefit of  reflecting a loss before income taxes of  and an increase in net deferred tax assets partially offset by state income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was  an effective tax rate of  which was higher than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the effect of state income taxes 
the above mentioned factors resulted in a net loss for the year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  
table of contents critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying the accounting policies most critical to its financial statements have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  the company s most critical policies include recording of inventory reserves  deferred taxes  and the potential impairment of goodwill 
these policies are discussed below 
the company also has other key accounting policies  including policies for revenue recognition and establishment of bad debt reserves 
the company believes that these other policies either do not generally require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or that it is less likely that they would have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations for a given period 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information 
although the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  these are based upon information available at the end of each reporting period and involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the company s estimates and its estimates could be different using different assumptions or conditions 
inventory reserves a significant source of the company s revenue arises from the sale of replacement parts required by customers who have previously purchased products 
as a result  the company maintains a large quantity of parts on hand that may not be sold or used in final assemblies for an extended period of time 
in order to recognize that certain inventory may become obsolete or have supplies in excess of reasonable supportable sales forecasts  management establishes an inventory valuation reserve 
the inventory valuation reserve is a significant estimate made by management and the actual results may differ from this estimate and the difference could be material 
management establishes the inventory valuation reserve by reviewing the inventory for items that should be reserved in full based on a lack of usage for a specified period of time and for which future demand is not forecasted and establishes an additional reserve for slow moving inventory based on varying percentages of the cost of the items 
at june  and approximately  and  respectively  of the raw materials and sub assemblies inventory were considered slow moving and subject to a reserve provision equal to all or a portion of the cost  less an estimate for scrap value 
in many instances  this inventory has been unsold for more than five years from date of manufacture or purchase  and in other instances the company has more than a five year supply of inventory on hand based on recent sales volume 
at june   the cost of inventory which has more than a five year supply on hand and the cost of inventory which has had no sales during the last five years amounted to approximately  management nevertheless believes that this inventory is properly valued and appropriately reserved 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  that would not result in a current cash charge since the cash required to manufacture or purchase the older inventory was expended in prior years 
the company records increases in inventory valuation reserves in cost of sales and decreases in inventory valuation reserves when items are scrapped or disposed of 
during the fiscal year ended june   the inventory valuation reserve was increased by   charged to cost of sales 
in addition  during fiscal the company scrapped or disposed of items which had a cost of  which represents of the difference between the  and  amounts referred to above  with the remaining decrease attributed to increased sales activity 
the inventory valuation reserve balance and activity information is presented in schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts for fiscal years  and deferred taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be 
table of contents generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
the company reviews its internal forecasted sales and pre tax earnings estimates to make its assessment about the utilization of deferred tax assets 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
if that assessment changes  a charge or a benefit would be recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the company has concluded that no deferred tax valuation allowance was necessary at june  and because future taxable income is believed to be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset 
net deferred tax assets decreased by  from  at june  to  at june  reflecting principally the net decrease in the inventory valuation reserve  amortization of goodwill for tax purposes  and utilization of the tax loss carry forward 
the decrease in the deferred tax asset relating to the inventory valuation reserve was due primarily to the disposal of inventory  during fiscal year goodwill impairment testing as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
goodwill was tested for impairment as of july   the initial test  and as of each july thereafter through july  all four tests were conducted by management with the assistance of an independent valuation company and the results of such tests indicated no impairment 
the company s goodwill carrying amounts relate solely to the acquisition of custom products and a g  which are two sfas reporting units 
bolt  the parent of custom products and a g  is a third reporting unit and has no goodwill 
both bolt and a g are in the geophysical equipment segment  and custom products is in the industrial products segment 
step one of the goodwill impairment test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the amount that a willing party would pay to buy or sell the unit other than in a forced liquidation sale 
the carrying amount of a reporting unit is total assets  including goodwill  minus total liabilities 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the carrying value  the company considers goodwill not to be impaired 
if the fair value is below the carrying value  the company would proceed to the next step  which is to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
any such impairment loss would be recognized in the company s results of operations in the period in which the impairment loss arose 
the company s method of determining the fair value of the custom and a g reporting units is to obtain from the valuation company an estimate of the fair value of these reporting units based on up to three different valuation approaches a a capitalized cash flow method  b a market approach that gives consideration to the prices paid for publicly traded stocks  and c a projected net income approach that examines the projected net income of certain publicly traded stocks and determines a multiple of earnings that the valuation specialist believes should be applied to the business unit s estimated earnings 
the company reviewed the estimated fair values utilizing each of the above approaches  and in each of the four annual tests performed  utilized the discounted cash flow method when reviewing for impairment 
the results of the other methods were also generally consistent with the company s conclusion that goodwill was not impaired 
the company also compared the values from the above approaches to the market capitalization of the company including the bolt unit that has no goodwill reflected in the financial statements to provide an overall test to ascertain the reasonableness of the approach used 
at all annual impairment test dates except july   the company s market capitalization exceeded the carrying value of stockholders equity at the impairment test date 
at july   the company s market capitalization was less than the company s stockholders equity  however this condition was reversed by august when the market price of the company s stock increased 
goodwill represents approximately of the company s total assets at june   and is thus a significant estimate made by management 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  that would not result in a current cash charge because the company s goodwill amounts reflected on its balance sheet arose out of acquisition accounting several years ago 
see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning goodwill 
recent accounting developments revenue recognition in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
sab supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the sec issued sab primarily to rescind accounting guidance provided by sab relating to multiple element revenue arrangements 
sab s accounting guidance for multiple element revenue arrangements is the same as eitf  and the other revenue recognition concepts contained in sab remain largely unchanged 
the company adopted the provisions of sab in the third quarter of fiscal year  retroactive to july  the adoption of sab had no effect on the company s financial position at june  or results of operations for the year ended june  employer s disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the adoption of sfas revised will not have any impact on the company s disclosures because the company does not have any defined benefit pension plans or other defined benefit postretirement plans 

table of contents consolidation of variable interest entities in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the adoption of this revision does not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements since the company does not have any variable interest entities
