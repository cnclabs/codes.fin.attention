item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the following consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which commence on page f overview the company is a residential land development and homebuilding company with properties located primarily in southern california 
the principal activities of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries include i obtaining zoning and other entitlements for land it owns or controls through purchase options and improving the land for residential development  and ii designing  constructing and selling single family residential homes in southern california 
once the residential land owned by the company is entitled  the company may build homes  sell unimproved land to other developers or homebuilders  sell improved land to homebuilders  or participate in joint ventures with other developers  investors or homebuilders to finance and construct infrastructure and homes 
during  the company will focus its immediate efforts to i obtain approval from the california coastal commission coastal commission for development permits to build homes on the upper bench of the bolsa chica mesa upper mesa  as further described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  and ii continue to expand its profitable homebuilding operations 
however  the company may also consider other strategic and joint venture opportunities  and there can be no assurance that the company will accomplish  in whole or in part  all or any of these strategic goals 
during and  the company generated gross operating margins from homebuilding activities and cash flows on assets other than bolsa chica 
the company currently has on going southern california projects in riverside county near the cities of north corona and riverside  in the city of chino in san bernardino county  and in the rancho santa fe area in san diego county 
these homebuilding projects are expected to generate cash flows and gross operating margins through however  the company s inventory of entitled land available for homebuilding projects is still limited 
given this limited inventory of buildable lots  the company is continuing to pursue residential lot acquisition opportunities 
due to delays in approvals for homebuilding at bolsa chica  continuation of homebuilding operations beyond is dependent upon acquisition of suitable  entitled residential lots within the southern california area or coastal commission approval of the company s development plan for homes on the upper mesa 
bolsa chica is the company s principal asset  representing of total assets at december  it has required and continues to require significant investments for entitlement and land development activities 
due to the november coastal commission approval of suggested modifications that would limit residential development to only the upper mesa  the company is faced with further delays in implementing its plans for residential development on the bolsa chica mesa 
the company is currently pursuing approval of permits for development of the upper mesa 
during may  the county of orange planning commission approved the company s site plan for development of single family homes on the upper mesa 
in response to an appeal  in july  the orange county board of supervisors upheld the planning commission s prior approval of the site plan and tentative tract map 
this development plan also requires approval by the coastal commission 
the planned community on the upper mesa  known as brightwater  is currently expected to offer a broad mix of home choices averaging  square feet and ranging in size from  square feet to  square feet 
brightwater also includes acres of parks  public trails and open space on the acre upper mesa 
with only homes on approximately acres of the upper mesa  the resulting low density plan equates to approximately homes per acre  consistent and compatible with the neighboring huntington beach communities 
in addition  the company will offer to dedicate acres of land on the huntington mesa to the county of orange to complete the harriett m 
wieder linear park  a acre planned regional park 
the  acre bolsa chica wetlands are fully preserved and protected in accordance with previous agreements with the state of california and are not included in the brightwater plan 
the company submitted a coastal development permit cdp application for brightwater to the coastal commission in november in january  the company was notified that the coastal commission expects to hold a public hearing on the company s cdp application in april  however  there can be no assurance that further delays will not be encountered 
the company does not believe that the coastal commission process will ultimately prevent it from developing a planned community at bolsa chica  however  there can be no assurance in that regard  or as to i when development could commence  ii the number of acres or homes the company will be permitted to develop  or iii the absence of further litigation or administrative delay 
the bolsa chica land trust and other environmental groups have suggested that the company consider selling the bolsa chica mesa to a nonprofit corporation or the state of california 
historically  there has been no source of funding to finance such a transaction 
however  in november voters approved a billion bond measure on california s ballot known as proposition and entitled the water quality  supply and safe drinking water projects 
coastal wetlands purchase and protection 
bonds 
the bond initiative includes an unquantified line item for the state of california to pursue the acquisition of not less than acres of the bolsa chica mesa 
the state is conducting an appraisal of the bolsa chica mesa  however  there can be no assurances that the company will ever receive an offer from the state for all or any part of the bolsa chica mesa  reach a mutually acceptable agreement on price and terms  or that a sale transaction will ever be completed 
under the terms of proposition  all property acquired must be from willing sellers  not by eminent domain 
therefore  if the company were to receive an offer from the state of california to purchase all or a part of the bolsa chica mesa  the company would have an opportunity to evaluate the value and terms of the offer before deciding whether to accept it  make a counter offer or reject it 
in reaching its decision  the company would consider how best to maximize stockholder value in light of the status and likelihood of development of various portions of its bolsa chica property at that time 
given the facts and circumstances described above  the company believes that the upper mesa can ultimately be developed  which would result in realization of an amount that is substantially in excess of the million book value presently reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  although there can be no assurance in that regard 
therefore  the company has no present intention of selling the entire bolsa chica mesa to the state at any price that is not substantially in excess of the present carrying value 
the company also believes that the current and historic public trading prices of the company s common stock have not adequately reflected the bolsa chica mesa s true value 
however  there can be no assurance that such public trading price will ever reflect what the company may believe to be the true value of the bolsa chica mesa 
from time to time  the company has received outside appraisals on an as developed basis which have supported the company s beliefs 
real estate held for current development or sale and land held for future development real estate properties are carried at fair value as of september   following adoption of fresh start reporting as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  as adjusted by subsequent activity 
the company s real estate properties are subject to a number of uncertainties which can affect the values of those assets 
these uncertainties include litigation or appeals of regulatory approvals as discussed above and availability of adequate capital  financing and cash flow 
in addition  future values may be adversely affected by increases in property taxes  increases in the costs of labor and materials and other development risks  changes in general economic conditions  including higher mortgage interest rates  and other real estate risks such as the general demand for housing and the supply of competitive products 
real estate properties do not constitute liquid assets and  at any given time  it may be difficult to sell a particular property for an appropriate price 
impact of inflation  changing prices and economic conditions real estate and residential housing prices are affected by inflation  which can cause increases in the price of land  raw materials and subcontracted labor 
unless these increased costs are recovered through higher sales prices  gross margin from home sales would decrease 
if interest rates increase  construction and financing costs would also increase  which can also result in lower gross margin from home sales 
the volatility of interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company s future operations and liquidity 
among other things  these conditions may affect adversely the demand for housing and the availability of mortgage financing and may reduce the credit facilities offered to the company 
there can be no assurance regarding the continued health of the southern california residential real estate market 
in particular  i the slow down in the national economy during the past several years and the jobless recovery to date  ii the state of california s budget deficit  and iii the volatility in the stock market  collectively may exert recessionary pressures on the california economy and may have a negative impact on the southern california housing market 
while low mortgage rates have sustained housing demand to date  any significant future increase in mortgage rates or significant loss of jobs in southern california would most likely slow demand for new homes 
increases in home mortgage interest rates make it more difficult for the company s customers to qualify for home mortgage loans  potentially decreasing home sales volume and prices 
the tight supply of new homes in southern california has resulted in significant home price increases over the last five years 
as a result  the affordability of new homes has been declining and could further jeopardize future demand 
most of the company s active homebuilding projects are located in the inland empire area of southern california  which includes riverside and san bernardino counties 
none of the company s projects experienced any direct impact from the southern california fires during late the inland empire has experienced significant population and job growth in the past decade 
while continued growth is expected  partially due to the limited supply of affordably priced housing in coastal areas such as orange county  there can be no assurance that economic  demographic or other factors will not slow  diminish or cause such growth to discontinue 
the company is continuing to pursue land development and lot acquisition opportunities throughout southern california 
critical accounting policies in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  the company applies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the application of generally accepted accounting principles may require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying results 
listed below are those policies that the company believes are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
the company s critical accounting policies include the evaluation of the impairment of long lived assets and the evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by its significant federal tax net operating losses  as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of land held for future development the bolsa chica project and real estate held for current development or sale including long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
these assets are carried at cost  unless the carrying amount of the parcel or subdivision is determined not to be fully recoverable  in which case the impaired real estate is written down to fair value 
given the significance of the carrying value of land held for future development  the application of sfas no 
in evaluating any potential impairment is critical to the company s consolidated financial statements  as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 in developing estimated future cash flows for impairment testing  the company has incorporated its own assumptions regarding the entitlement prospects of land held for future development and its own market assumptions including those regarding home prices  infrastructure and home building costs regarding both land held for future development and real estate held for current development or sale 
additionally  as appropriate  the company identifies alternative courses of action to recover the carrying value of its long lived assets and evaluates all likely alternatives under a probability weighted approach as suggested in sfas no 
basis of consolidation certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the company are members in joint ventures involved in the development and sale of residential projects and residential loan production 
the consolidated statements of the company include the accounts of the company and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and joint ventures 
the financial statements of joint ventures in which the company generally has a controlling or majority economic interest and thus are controlled by the company are consolidated with the company s financial statements 
minority interest represents the equity interest of the company s joint venture partner for one consolidated venture and is further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method when the company does not have voting or economic control of the venture operations  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes on the liability method 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the liability method requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by deferred tax assets  such as tax net operating losses nols 
a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
given the significance of the company s historical federal tax nols  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the application of the company s policy in evaluating the expected future benefit of nols is critical 
in applying those policies  estimates and judgments affect the amounts at which certain assets and liabilities are recorded 
we apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis 
as circumstances change  they are considered in our estimates and judgments  and future changes in circumstances could result in changes in amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded 
homebuilding revenues and cost of sales the company s homebuilding operation generates revenues from the sale of homes to homebuyers 
the majority of these homes are designed to appeal to move up homebuyers and the homes are generally offered for sale in advance of their construction 
sales contracts are usually subject to certain contingencies such as the buyer s ability to qualify for financing 
revenue from the sale of homes is recognized at closing when title passes to the buyer  and the earnings process is complete 
as a result  the company s revenue recognition process does not involve significant judgments or estimates 
however  the company does rely on certain projections and estimates to determine the related construction costs and resulting gross margins associated with revenues recognized 
the cost of sales is recorded based upon total estimated costs within a subdivision and allocated using the relative sales value method 
the company s construction costs are comprised of direct and allocated costs  including estimated costs for future warranties and indemnities 
the company s estimates are based on historical results  adjusted for current factors 
litigation reserves the company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various cases arising in the normal course of business and regarding disposed assets and businesses of the company or former affiliates see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has reserved for costs expected to be incurred with respect to these cases based upon information provided by its legal counsel 
there can be no assurance that total litigation costs actually incurred will not exceed the amount of such reserve 
stock based compensation prior to the second quarter of  the company accounted for its stock based employee compensation plan using the recognition and measurement principles intrinsic value method of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and the related financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation fin 
as a result of the may repricing of outstanding stock options  the company accounted for the options as variable awards and recorded non cash stock based compensation expense on a cumulative basis as the difference between the option exercise price and the quoted market price of the company s common stock 
from may through the first quarter of  non cash compensation expense was reflected for stock price changes pursuant to variable accounting for repriced options 
during the second quarter of  the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
for this change in accounting  the company selected the modified prospective method under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
under this method  the change is retroactive to january   and compensation cost recognized for is the same as that which would have been recognized had the recognition provisions of sfas been applied from its original effective date 
in accordance with sfas  results for prior years have not been restated 
sfas states that the adoption of the fair value based method is a change to a preferable method of accounting 
management believes that use of the fair value based method to record employee stock based compensation expense is consistent with the accounting for all other forms of compensation 
the adoption of sfas may have a significant impact on the company s future consolidated results of operations  due to the elimination of the potential future effects of variable accounting for repriced stock options 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and  and rescission of fin no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company adopted the disclosure provision of such interpretation on december  and the recognition provision on january   as required 
the company s adoption of such interpretation did not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
additional disclosures are presented in note to these consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities and in december  issued interpretation no 
revised december consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of apb no 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin no 
r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin apb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support from other parties 
the company adopted all requirements of fin no 
effective january   including those which apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and certain of the disclosure requirements applicable in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established and the consolidation requirements applicable to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  fin no 
r applies immediately to variable interest entities created after december   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies no later than the first reporting period ending after december   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest other than special purpose that it acquired before january  fin no 
r applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period 
the company believes that the adoption of fin no 
and fin no 
r will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  sfas which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope  which may have previously been reported as equity  as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  for public companies 
in october  the fasb deferred implementation of paragraphs and of sfas regarding certain limited life entities with equity consolidated as minority interest by the parent company 
this deferral is for an indefinite period 
as of september  the company consolidates two joint ventures which are affected by this deferral see note 
the company is evaluating the impact adoption of sfas will have on its financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the principal assets in the company s portfolio are residential land which must be held over an extended period of time in order to be developed to a condition that  in management s opinion  will ultimately maximize the return to the company 
consequently  the company requires significant capital to finance its real estate development and homebuilding operations 
historically  sources of capital have included bank lines of credit  specific property financings  asset sales and available internal funds 
the company is utilizing internally generated cash to fund the north corona  riverside and rancho santa fe homebuilding projects and the bolsa chica land development project 
in addition  the company is utilizing project debt and joint venture contributions to fund construction of the chino project and joint venture contributions to fund the oxnard land development project 
the company s current homebuilding projects  which are primarily in the inland empire area of southern california riverside and san bernardino counties are currently expected to generate approximately million of positive cash flows during the next months  based on present economic conditions and market assumptions 
the company s cash and cash equivalents as of december  were approximately million 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  future real estate sales proceeds  and funds available under its credit agreements will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating and capital investment requirements  primarily project development costs for homebuilding projects  and the oxnard and bolsa chica land development projects  along with general and administrative expenses  for the next months 
the company is subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase of land and improved homesites 
these purchase contracts typically require a cash deposit and the purchase of properties under these contracts is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the sellers  including obtaining applicable property entitlements 
the company also utilizes option contracts with third party land sellers and financial entities as a method of acquiring land in staged takedowns and minimizing the use of funds from other corporate financing sources 
these option contracts also help to manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings 
option contracts generally require the payment of a non refundable cash deposit for the right to acquire lots over a specified period of time at predetermined prices 
we have the right at our discretion to terminate our obligations under these option agreements by forfeiting our cash deposit with no further financial responsibility 
the company may enter into land development and homebuilding joint ventures from time to time as a means of expanding its market opportunities  establishing strategic alliances  managing its risk profile and leveraging the company s capital base 
these joint ventures may obtain secured acquisition  development and construction financing  which minimizes the use of funds from other corporate financing sources 
financial condition december  compared with december  cash flows from homebuilding operations for primarily reflect sales proceeds of million from deliveries of homes and million from industrial property in signal hill  california  net borrowing under project debt financing of  and joint venture capital contributed minority interest for the chino project of million 
these sources of funds were used primarily for investments in real estate and construction costs of million  including the acquisition of lots in chino  california and eight lots in the rancho santa fe  california area 
other significant uses of cash include approximately million for investment in the bolsa chica mesa project  primarily for consultants engaged in the entitlement process   net investment in the oxnard land development joint venture  and selling  general and administrative expenses paid of approximately million 
these items  as well as other activity presented in the statements of cash flows  resulted in the million increase in cash and cash equivalents 
the  increase in other assets primarily reflects investments in the unconsolidated oxnard land development joint venture and deposits for purchases of entitled land 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by approximately million  to a balance of million as of december   primarily reflecting an increased accrual for incentive bonuses related to the company s homebuilding operation 
the increase in capital in excess of par value of approximately million primarily reflects the reversal of valuation reserves on pre reorganization nols utilized during  which as of december  were offset by a valuation reserve 
results of operations the nature of the real estate development business is such that individual real estate transactions often cause significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter and year to year 
compared with the company reported homebuilding revenues of million and gross operating profit from homebuilding of approximately million for  compared with million in revenues and gross operating profit of approximately million for this represents a million or increase in homebuilding revenues and a million increase in gross operating profit from homebuilding 
revenues during reflect deliveries of homes  including homes at the company s riverside projects  homes at the north corona projects and the final three homes at the yucaipa project 
revenues during reflect deliveries of an aggregate of homes at the yucaipa and north corona projects 
the increase in the average price of homes sold from  in to  in  and the improved gross margin from homebuilding from for to in reflect home price appreciation experienced over the past year and higher profitability of the riverside project as compared with the yucaipa project 
in addition  during  the company reported revenue from a non residential land sale of million  resulting in a gross operating profit of approximately million  or approximately  which when combined with the homebuilding gross margin  resulted in the overall gross margin of 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  to million in as compared with million in  reflects an increase in accrued incentive compensation for the company s homebuilding business  largely offset by the absence in of approximately  of compensation expense recorded in pursuant to variable accounting for repriced options in accordance with apb the  decrease in income from unconsolidated joint ventures from approximately  for to approximately  for reflects reduced income from the fairbanks highlands project  due to the completion of home deliveries during the first quarter of the million of other expense  net in the current year as compared with  of expense in  primarily reflects additional accruals of approximately  for estimated environmental remediation costs  and  for contingent indemnity obligations related to asbestos claims in the period 
other expense also includes recurring pension and real estate holding period costs  which were largely offset by recovery of  of water rights certificates related to a completed project  the value of which had been charged to cost of sales in prior years 
the increase in expense also reflects the absence in the current year of million in gains on sales of short term investments  which were realized during the second quarter of these gains in the period were partially offset by increased non recurring period costs related to land held for future development 
during  the company s tax provision was partially offset by a tax benefit of approximately  in connection with the reduction in reserves for contingent tax liabilities recorded in conjunction with periodic reviews of the adequacy of such reserves 
during  the company recorded an income tax benefit of  this benefit included a provision for income taxes of  which was more than offset by tax benefits equivalent to reductions of reserves for state tax liabilities of million 
the reductions in tax reserves in and were due to expiration of statutes of limitations or settlements in eight states  and one state  respectively  which reduced the company s exposure 
compared with the company reported revenues of million and gross operating profit of million for the year ended december   compared with revenues of million and gross operating profit of million for revenues in reflect deliveries of an aggregate of homes including homes at the providence ranch project in north corona  california and homes at the yucaipa project 
revenues in reflect deliveries of an aggregate of homes including homes at the rancho san pasqual project  homes at the sandover project on the bolsa chica mesa in huntington beach  california and homes at the yucaipa project 
the decrease in the average price of homes sold from  during to  during reflects the lower price ranges commanded by the inland empire in comparison to orange county and san diego county 
the gross margin of for the year ended december  reflects the aggregate margin on the yucaipa and providence ranch projects as compared to the gross margin of for the prior year primarily from the rancho san pasqual and sandover projects  which had lower land cost bases 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december   compared to  primarily reflects  of non cash compensation expense recorded pursuant to variable accounting for repriced stock options 
the million decrease in income from unconsolidated joint ventures to  for the year ended december  as compared to million in reflects the decrease in the company s share of venture profits from deliveries of four homes and one out parcel at fairbanks highlands during the current year  as compared with deliveries of homes in the prior year 
the decrease in other income  net from million of income in to approximately  of expense for the year ended december  primarily reflects non recurring income in of million from the receipt of securities as demutualization proceeds  which was partially offset by million of expense from changes in estimates for an indemnity obligation for a former affiliate s disposed business  retirement benefits for former directors and an environmental issue 
the amount primarily reflects million in gains on sales of short term investments  largely offset by increased period costs for land held for future development 
during the years ended december  and  the company recorded income tax benefits of  and million  respectively 
these benefits included provisions for income taxes of  and million  respectively  which were more than offset by tax benefits equivalent to reductions of reserves for state tax liabilities of million and million  respectively  recorded in conjunction with periodic reviews of the adequacy of such reserves 
payments under contractual obligations the company has entered into certain contractual obligations to make future payments for items such as project debt and lease agreements 
a summary of the payments due under specified contractual obligations  aggregated by category of contractual obligation  for specified time periods is presented below as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years project debt operating leases 


total 
the company s purchase contracts which are made in the normal course of its homebuilding business for land acquisition and construction subcontracts are generally cancelable at will 
other contractual obligations including the company s other tax liabilities  accrued benefit liability for a frozen retirement plan and other accrued pensions  home warranty reserves and contingent indemnity and environmental obligations are estimated based on various factors 
payments are not due as of a given date  but rather are dependent upon the incurrence of professional services  the lives of annuitants and other factors

on december   the henley group  inc separated its business into two public companies through a distribution to its common stockholders of all of the common stock of a newly formed delaware corporation to which the henley group  inc had contributed its non real estate development operations  certain assets and related and unrelated liabilities 
the new company was named the henley group  inc henley group immediately following the distribution 
the remaining company was renamed henley properties inc henley properties and consisted of the real estate development business and assets of henley group  including its principal subsidiary signal landmark 
on july   a subsidiary of henley properties merged with and into henley group the merger and henley group became a wholly owned subsidiary of henley properties 
in the merger  henley properties  through its henley group subsidiary  received net assets having a book value as of july  of approximately million 
in connection with the merger  henley properties was renamed the bolsa chica company 
on september   a subsidiary of the bolsa chica company acquired the domestic real estate development business and related assets of the koll company 
in connection with this acquisition  the bolsa chica company was renamed koll real estate group  inc on september   the company completed a recapitalization recapitalization 
the recapitalization  which was effective pursuant to a prepackaged plan of reorganization that was confirmed by the us bankruptcy court  resulted in the exchange of all the then existing debentures  series a preferred stock and class a common stock into new common stock 
the prepackaged plan was filed by the company  excluding all of its subsidiaries and affiliates  contemporaneously with a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in july upon the recapitalization  the company adopted the provisions of statement of position sop no 
financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code fresh start reporting 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities were revalued to reflect their reorganization value  approximating their fair value at the effective date of the recapitalization 
in addition  the accumulated deficit of the company was eliminated and its capital structure recast in conformity with the recapitalization and  as such  the company has recorded the effects of the recapitalization and fresh start reporting as of the effective date 
on april   the company sold its commercial development business

certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation 
note significant accounting policies cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents 
real estate real estate held for current development or sale is carried at the lower of cost  or fair value  less costs to sell 
land held for future development is carried at cost  with write downs to fair value only in the event that costs cannot be recovered from estimated undiscounted future cash flows  as described under impairment of long lived assets 
the estimation process involved in the determination of fair value is inherently uncertain since it requires estimates as to future events and market conditions 
such estimation process assumes the company s ability to complete development and dispose of its real estate properties in the ordinary course of business based on management s present plans and intentions 
economic  market  environmental and political conditions may affect management s development and marketing plans 
in addition  the implementation of such development and marketing plans could be affected by the availability of future financing for development and construction activities 
accordingly  the ultimate values of the company s real estate properties are dependent upon future economic and market conditions  the availability of financing  and the resolution of political  environmental and other related issues 
the cost of sales of multi unit projects is generally computed using the relative sales value method 
interest cost is capitalized to real estate projects during their development and construction period 
impairment of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of land held for future development and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires an impaired asset  for which costs cannot be recovered from estimated undiscounted future cash flows  be written down to fair value 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
as provided by sfas no 
 impairment is evaluated by comparing an asset s carrying value to the undiscounted estimated cash flows expected from the asset s operations and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset 
if an impairment occurs  the fair value of an asset for purposes of sfas no 
is deemed to be the amount a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for such asset in a current transaction 
on september   the company completed its recapitalization pursuant to court confirmation of a prepackaged plan of reorganization  and the company applied the principles required by the american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position sop f  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code fresh start reporting and the carrying value of real estate properties was adjusted to fair value see note 
following the california coastal commission s november approval of suggested modifications to the bolsa chica local coastal program  which would limit development to only the upper bench of the company s acre mesa property bolsa chica mesa see note  the company evaluated this asset s carrying value 
the company has updated its analysis at each year end since december  since the undiscounted estimated future cash flows from the upper bench of the bolsa chica mesa the upper mesa and the company s additional acres at bolsa chica exceed its carrying value  there has been no impairment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 in developing estimated future cash flows for impairment testing  the company has incorporated its own assumptions regarding the entitlement prospects of land held for future development and its own market assumptions including those regarding home prices  infrastructure and home building costs regarding both land held for future development and real estate held for current development or sale 
additionally  as appropriate  the company identifies alternative courses of action to recover the carrying value of its long lived assets and evaluates all likely alternatives under a probability weighted approach as suggested in sfas no 
basis of consolidation certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the company are members in joint ventures involved in the development and sale of residential projects and residential loan production 
the consolidated statements of the company include the accounts of the company and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and joint ventures 
the financial statements of joint ventures in which the company generally has a controlling or majority economic interest and thus are controlled by the company are consolidated with the company s financial statements 
minority interest represents the equity interest of the company s joint venture partner for one consolidated venture and is further described in note the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method  when the company does not have voting or economic control of the venture operations  as further described in note income taxes the company accounts for income taxes on the liability method 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which these differences are expected to reverse 
the liability method requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
homebuilding revenues and cost of sales the company s homebuilding operation generates revenues from the sale of homes to homebuyers 
the majority of these homes are designed to appeal to move up homebuyers and are generally offered for sale in advance of their construction 
sales contracts are usually subject to certain contingencies such as the buyer s ability to qualify for financing 
revenue from the sale of homes is f recognized at closing when title passes to the buyer and the earnings process is complete 
as a result  the company s revenue recognition process does not involve significant judgments or estimates 
however  the company does rely on certain estimates to determine the related construction costs and resulting gross margins associated with revenues recognized 
the cost of sales is recorded based upon total estimated costs within a subdivision and allocated using the relative sales value method 
the company s construction costs are comprised of direct and allocated costs  including estimated costs for future warranties and indemnities 
the company s estimates are based on historical results  adjusted for current factors 
warranty costs warranty reserves are established as homes close escrow on a per unit basis in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and outside labor to be incurred during the warranty period 
reserves are determined based upon historical data with respect to similar product types and geographical areas 
litigation reserves the company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various cases arising in the normal course of business and regarding disposed assets and businesses of the company or former affiliates 
the company has reserved for costs expected to be incurred with respect to these cases based upon information provided by its legal counsel 
earnings per common share the weighted average number of common shares outstanding was million for each of the years ended december   and earnings per share  assuming dilution  is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding 
for the years ended december  and  the average market price of the company s common stock exceeded the exercise price of outstanding stock options

the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company adopted the disclosure provision of such interpretation on december   and the recognition provision on january   as required

the company is evaluating the impact adoption of sfas will have on its financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
note land held for future development the company owns approximately acres located in orange county  california overlooking the pacific ocean and the bolsa chica wetlands which were sold by the company to the state of california in  surrounded by the city of huntington beach and approximately miles south of downtown los angeles 
the company s holdings include acres on a mesa north of the bolsa chica wetlands bolsa chica mesa  approximately acres on  or adjacent to  the huntington mesa and acres of lowlands which were acquired by the company in september a local coastal program lcp for development of up to  homes on the bolsa chica mesa was approved by the orange county board of supervisors in december and by the coastal commission in january in october  in response to a trial court decision in connection with a lawsuit which challenged the approvals of the coastal commission the coastal act lawsuit  the coastal commission approved modifications to the lcp which eliminated the filling of warner pond and thereby reduced the maximum number of homes to be built from  to no more than  homes on the bolsa chica mesa 
the orange county board of supervisors subsequently accepted the coastal commission s suggested modifications  however  this approval was challenged in trial court and then in the court of appeals 
in november  in response to the april court of appeal s decision in the coastal act lawsuit which prohibited relocation of a acre grove of dying eucalyptus trees which serves as raptor habitat  the coastal commission held another public hearing on the lcp and approved suggested modifications that would limit development to only the upper mesa 
the coastal commission s november suggested modifications to the lcp would prohibit the company from development on the approximately acre lower bench of the bolsa chica mesa the lower mesa 
in may  the county of orange declined to consider the coastal commission s november suggested modifications 
in their response to the coastal commission  the county stated that the commission s suggested modifications were infeasible and unacceptable 
in particular  the county noted that the commission s suggested modifications would remove acres of viable residentially zoned land from the county s plan 
f in january  the company challenged the coastal commission s november suggestion to substantially change the previously approved lcp 
the company s petition alleged that the coastal commission arbitrarily abandoned decades of prior approvals that would have permitted development on the entire bolsa chica mesa 
the petition challenged the commission s november decision as to how to protect certain raptor habitat on the bolsa chica mesa  including the commission s recommendation that the lower mesa not be developed 
on february   the court issued a ruling  which denied the company s petition on the grounds that the coastal commission s november decision expired by operation of law when the county rejected the coastal commission s suggested modifications 
as a result  the coastal commission s decision to prohibit development on the lower mesa is no longer of any force or effect 
in addition  the court s opinion recommended that the company put a new  legally reviewable plan before the coastal commission  and accordingly  the company is continuing its pursuit of reasonable development on the bolsa chica mesa as discussed below 
the company is currently pursuing approval of permits for development of the upper mesa 
during may  the county of orange planning commission approved the company s site plan for development of single family homes on the upper mesa 
in response to an appeal  in july  the orange county board of supervisors upheld the planning commission s prior approval of the site plan and tentative tract map 
this development plan also requires approval by the coastal commission 
the planned community on the upper mesa  known as brightwater  is currently expected to offer a broad mix of home choices  averaging  square feet and ranging in size from  square feet to  square feet 
brightwater also includes acres of parks  public trails and open space on the acre upper mesa 
with only homes on approximately acres of the upper mesa  the resulting low density plan equates to approximately homes per acre  consistent and compatible with the neighboring huntington beach communities 
in addition  the company will offer to dedicate acres of land on the huntington mesa to the county of orange to complete the harriett m 
wieder linear park  a acre planned regional park 
the  acre bolsa chica wetlands are fully preserved and protected in accordance with previous agreements with the state of california and are not included in the brightwater plan 
the company submitted a coastal development permit cdp application for brightwater to the coastal commission in november in january  the company was notified that the coastal commission expects to hold a public hearing on the company s cdp application in april  however  there can be no assurance that further delays will not be encountered 
the company does not believe that the coastal commission process will permanently prevent it from developing a planned community at bolsa chica  however  there can be no assurance in that regard  or as to i when development could commence  ii the number of acres or homes the company will be permitted to develop  or iii the absence of further litigation or administrative delay 
upon completion of the company s recapitalization as discussed in note  the company applied the accounting principles required by fresh start reporting and the carrying value of land held for development bolsa chica was adjusted to fair value as of september   after consideration of the october coastal commission action discussed above 
the fair value was determined in using discounted estimated cash flows expected from the asset s operations and eventual disposition 
following the november coastal commission action  an assessment of impairment was conducted by the company for the year ended december  the company updated its analysis at each year end since  and has noted no indicators of impairment since that date 
future costs incurred f for capitalizable development activities for the bolsa chica project will increase the basis of the land 
an estimate for these costs has been included in the company s estimated undiscounted cash flow forecast used in its impairment analyses 
in accordance with the company s policy described in note impairment of long lived assets  since the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  from the upper mesa and the company s additional acres at bolsa chica exceed its december  carrying value  the company believes there has been no impairment 
the estimation process involved in the determination of value is inherently uncertain since it requires estimates as to future events and market conditions 
such estimation process assumes the company s ability to complete development and dispose of its real estate properties in the ordinary course of business based on management s present plans and intentions 
economic  market  environmental and political conditions may affect management s development and marketing plans 
in addition  the implementation of such development and marketing plans could be affected by the availability of future financing for development and construction activities 
the development of the company s bolsa chica mesa project is dependent upon various governmental approvals and economic factors 
accordingly  the amount ultimately realized from such project may differ materially from current estimates and the project s carrying value 
note investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are or less owned  not substantially controlled by the company  and accordingly  are accounted for using the equity method and are not consolidated with the company s consolidated financial statements 
condensed combined financial information regarding the company s investments in i the home fairbanks highlands joint venture san diego  california  ii a residential loan production partnership with a major commercial bank and iii the oxnard land development joint venture described below are summarized as follows in millions  except home closings balance sheet data total assets total liabilities

statement of operations data revenues expenses 
net income home closings f in february  the company entered into two option contracts to acquire land adjacent to the city of oxnard in ventura county  california aggregating approximately acres 
the company is in the process of developing a land plan for the site  which includes an additional acres owned by other landowners  with the intention of entitling the property for residential development and annexing it to the city of oxnard 
the company currently expects that the residential development plan will include approximately  single family and approximately multi family residential sites  however  these numbers are subject to change during the course of the entitlement process 
the option contracts allow for two years  plus up to three additional years through the exercise of extensions  for the company to complete these entitlement activities in advance of consummating the purchase transactions 
the option holder has the right in its sole discretion to terminate the obligations under these option agreements by forfeiting the cash deposits with no further financial responsibility 
during october  the company entered into a limited liability company oxnard llc joint venture agreement with a major financial partner to pursue the oxnard development opportunity 
the company assigned the land purchase option contracts to the oxnard llc

total contributions of the non managing member are generally limited to million 
after payment of a preferred return on invested capital to each member  first tier profits are generally allocated to the non managing member and to the managing member and second tier profits and all losses are generally allocated to each member 
while the company will exert a large degree of control over the venture  the non managing member does have various approval rights with regard to the major business decisions  and therefore the operations of the venture are not consolidated

note other liabilities other liabilities were comprised of the following as of december in millions net deferred taxes and other tax liabilities accrued pensions and benefits home warranty reserves contingent indemnity and environmental obligations unamortized discount 
the decrease in net deferred taxes and other tax liabilities primarily reflects resolution of certain contingent liabilities described in note contingent indemnity and environmental obligations primarily reflect reserves before related discount recorded pursuant to fresh start reporting for contingent indemnity obligations for businesses disposed of by former affiliates and unrelated to the company s current operations  and the company s liability for pcb contamination on its acre bolsa chica lowlands property as further described below 
in may  dresser industries  inc dresser filed litigation  captioned dresser industries  inc vs 
california coastal communities  inc 
and resco holdings  inc resco  a former affiliate  in the th judicial district court of jefferson county  texas 
dresser seeks a declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under a january purchase agreement 
under the agreement  dresser acquired an engineering and construction business from the mw kellogg company kellogg  a corporation formerly affiliated to the company 
kellogg and its parent company  wheelabrator technologies  inc wheelabrator  agreed to indemnify dresser against certain pre closing claims 
in a subsequent transaction  wheelabrator assigned certain assets and liabilities relating to the january purchase agreement to the company 
dresser also seeks unspecified damages for breach of the purchase agreement  along with attorney s fees and costs 
dresser s indemnity claims relate to several hundred lawsuits encompassing approximately  f contested asbestos claims made by third parties in connection with work in facilities in which the dresser acquired engineering and construction business was allegedly connected 
the company denies dresser s allegations and is vigorously defending itself in this case and related matters 
the company was not formed until september and  upon being spun off in december from wheelabrator  agreed to indemnify wheelabrator for its potential liabilities under the january purchase agreement with dresser to the extent that any such liabilities are not covered by insurance 
however  the company and resco contend that any contractual duty to indemnify dresser under the january purchase agreement for any third party asbestos claims expired in march under the terms of the january purchase agreement 
the company also believes that it has a number of other meritorious defenses to this litigation 
this litigation is in the discovery process 
the company has participated in initial settlement discussions in connection with a mediation which was ordered by the court in advance of the trial 
the trial has been postponed to august in order to allow time for dresser to emerge from its chapter bankruptcy proceedings and for the mediation process to continue 
however  there can be no assurance that a settlement can be reached before trial 
given the preliminary nature of these proceedings  the company is not able to assess its potential exposure with any degree of accuracy 
while the company s litigation accrual reflects its estimate for the minimum costs which are probable and estimable  defense costs and damage awards in asbestos cases can involve amounts that would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operations and financial condition  in the event that a judgment for an indemnity for such defense costs and awards was to be rendered against the company 
in september  the company acquired acres in the bolsa chica lowlands with the intent of selling it to the state of california in connection with their planned restoration of  acres of adjacent wetlands 
while the state continues to express interest in acquiring this property  no such agreement has been reached to date and there can be no assurances that any agreement will ever be reached 
however  in anticipation of entering into a purchase agreement  the state performed limited soils sampling on this property and notified the company in that it had discovered contamination from a group of chemicals called pcbs 
the source of the contamination is presently unknown  however  the company has never conducted any development  business or operations on this property 
in january  the state s department of toxic substances control dtsc became the regulatory agency responsible for overseeing the company s efforts to remediate the contamination on this property 
on july   a subsidiary of the company entered into a consent order with dtsc regarding remediation 
the company s subsidiary prepared a remedial investigation ri workplan  which was approved by dtsc in august during september and december  the subsidiary performed soil sampling at the site according to the ri workplan to determine the nature and extent of contamination  and recently submitted an ri report to dtsc 
as of december   the subsidiary has accrued approximately million for environmental testing and remediation of this property 
while the accrual reflects the estimate for the minimum costs which are probable and estimable  such accrual may not be adequate to satisfy the full amount of remediation that may be required by the dtsc 
until a remediation plan has been approved by dtsc  the company cannot accurately estimate how much  if any  additional costs may ultimately be incurred  however  the company has been advised that costs could range up to approximately million in excess of the current accrual 
there is no maximum limitation to the obligation of the company s subsidiary to remediate under the dtsc consent order 
other parties  who have yet to be identified  may be f responsible for all or a portion of these remediation costs 
if any such party is subsequently identified  the company s subsidiary may be entitled to seek reimbursement for some or all of its costs  however  there can be no assurance in that regard 
the company provides a home warranty reserve to reflect its contingent liability for product warranty 
the company generally records a provision as homes are delivered  based upon historical and industry experience  subject to certain minimums 
the home warranty reserve activity is presented below in millions balance at beginning of year provision

balance at end of year note income taxes upon completion of the recapitalization  the company experienced an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code the code as a result of the increase in the percentage of the company s stock by value held by certain persons including creditors who exchanged debt for stock of more than percentage points at any time during a three year period 
subsequent to an ownership change  the company s annual use of its net operating losses nols is generally limited to the value of the company s equity immediately before the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate 
however  section l of the code  the bankruptcy exception  provides that if the ownership change occurs through a bankruptcy  such as the company s recapitalization which utilized a prepackaged plan  and if the continuing shareholders and qualifying creditors before the ownership change own at least of the company s stock after the ownership change  the general limitations of section will not apply 
qualifying creditors generally must have held their debt at least months before the prepackaged plan was filed on july   or the debt must have arisen in the ordinary course of the company s business 
the company believes that it qualifies for the bankruptcy exception of section l 
under this exception  the company was required to reduce its nols by i the amount of interest accrued on any debt exchanged for stock in the bankruptcy proceeding during the year of the proceeding and the three prior taxable years and ii an additional amount required to make the total reduction equal to the amount of cancelation of indebtedness income realized 
accordingly  the company s nols of approximately million as of september  were reduced by approximately million 
as reduced  the company s nol carryovers are fully deductible against post reorganization income  subject to the general rules regarding change of ownership as discussed below  and expiration of nols 
the federal nols available as of december  are approximately million  including pre reorganization nols of approximately million  after reflecting activity subsequent to september  and the settlement with the internal revenue service irs discussed below 
the amount of nols which expire if not utilized is zero  million  million  million  million and million for     and thereafter  respectively 
f the company remains subject to the general rules regarding a change of ownership under section of the code  which limit the availability of nols if an ownership change occurs within any three year period 
if the company was to experience another ownership change  the use of all remaining nols would generally be subject to an annual limitation equal to the value of the company s equity before the ownership change  multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate 
the company estimates that after giving effect to various transactions by stockholders who hold a or greater interest in the company  as of february   it has experienced a three year cumulative ownership shift of approximately  as computed in accordance with section in response to an unsolicited written consent from a majority of its stockholders  the company amended its certificate of incorporation on october  in order to preserve the ability of the company to utilize its tax loss carryforwards 
since the company s use of its nols would be severely restricted if it experiences an ownership change of or more  the company s majority stockholders requested that the board of directors enact the amendments  which have been determined to be in the best interest of the company and its stockholders 
the amendments prohibit future purchases of the company s common stock by persons who would become new holders  and also prohibit current holders of over from increasing their positions  except in certain permissible circumstances which would not jeopardize the company s ability to use its nols 
while these amendments reduced the company s risk of an ownership change occurring due to the acquisition of shares by stockholders  the risk remains that an ownership change could result from the sale of shares by existing stockholders 
during september  the company s board of directors authorized two new investors to purchase an aggregate of approximately of the company s common stock since such transactions would not jeopardize the company s ability to use its nols 
the tax effects of items that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax accounts for the years ended december in millions are as follows deferred tax assets accruals reserves not deductible until paid net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards state income tax provisions deductible when paid for federal tax purposes valuation allowance deferred tax liabilities land held for future development principally due to accounting for a prior business combination  partially offset by asset revaluations in and unrealized gain on securities net deferred tax liabilities f net deferred tax liabilities at december  and are primarily comprised of state net deferred tax liabilities and are included in other liabilities
