item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discusses the timberland company s we  our  us  timberland or the company results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
the discussion  including known trends and uncertainties identified by management  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
included is a discussion and reconciliation of total company and international revenue growth to constant dollar revenue growth 
constant dollar revenue growth  which excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates  is not a generally accepted accounting principle gaap performance measure 
it is used by the company in its analysis of its financial condition and results of operations

we sell these products through high quality distribution channels including our own retail stores

these include enhancing our leadership position in footwear  capturing growth opportunities in outdoor inspired apparel  extending brand reach through development of the timberland pro series and brand building licensing arrangements  expanding geographically and driving operational and financial excellence while setting the standard for commitment to the community

repurchased  shares of our class a common stock during the year 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns and allowances  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  the carrying value of inventories  derivatives  other contingencies  impairment of assets and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
historically  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates used in applying these critical accounting policies 
currently  the company is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements sales returns and allowances our revenue consists of sales to wholesale customers  retail store revenues  license fees and royalties 
we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of the sale 
license fees and royalties are recognized as earned per the terms of our licensing and royalty agreements 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated wholesale and retail customer returns and allowances 
we base our estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances  as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns and allowances  which are known to us but which have not yet been received 
our total reserves for sales returns and allowances were million at december  and million at december  the actual amount of customer returns or allowances  which are inherently uncertain  may differ from our estimates 
if we determine that increases or decreases to sales returns and allowances are appropriate  we record either a reduction or an increase to net sales in the period in which we make such a determination 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates for losses relating to our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses primarily based upon our historical rate of credit losses and our knowledge of the financial condition of our customers 
our allowances for doubtful accounts totaled million and million at december  and historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  we provide for estimated losses resulting from disputes which arise with respect to the gross carrying value of our receivables and the amounts which customers owe to us 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
if we determine that increases or decreases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are appropriate  we record either an increase or decrease to selling expense in the period we make such a determination 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions 
if we determine that the estimated market value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory  we provide a reserve for such difference as a charge to cost of sales 
our reserves related to inventory valuation totaled million at december  and million at december  if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than our estimates  adjustments to our inventory reserves may be required 
the adjustments would decrease or increase our cost of sales and net income in the period in which they are recognized 
derivatives we are routinely subject to currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income as we purchase and sell goods in foreign markets in their local currencies 
we use derivative instruments  specifically forward contracts  to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency transactions 
we use our operating budget and periodic forecasts to estimate future economic exposure and to determine the appropriate levels and timing of related hedging transactions 
we closely monitor our foreign currency exposure and adjust our hedge positions accordingly 
our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may vary from the ultimate transactions see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
future operating results may be impacted by adjustments to these estimates 
long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the estimate of its fair market value 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about expected future operating performance 
those estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  or changes to business operations 
for fiscal and  other than immaterial retail store closing charges  no significant impairment related to the carrying value of our long lived assets has been recorded 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon book to tax differences 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions  an adjustment may be required in the net carrying value of the deferred tax assets  which would result in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for any valuation adjustment quarterly 
we estimate what the effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  the estimate is continually refined based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to the expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate

worldwide  we opened stores and closed in gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of sales  or gross margin  for was as compared to for  an improvement of basis points 
we experienced benefits from lower product related costs of approximately basis points driven primarily by efficiencies in our supply chain operations 
the elimination of significant expense incurred in related to the west coast dockworker s stoppage provided year over year improvement in our gross margin of approximately basis points 
lower impacts from off price sales contributed approximately basis points of benefit and foreign exchange rate changes  net of hedging impacts  added approximately basis points to gross margin 
we continue to target improvements in gross margins to support our goal of strong profit growth

these costs amounted to million and million for and  respectively 
operating expense operating expense was million in  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues in  an increase of million or basis points as a percentage of sales 
foreign exchange rate changes accounted for million  or of the operating expenses increase 
increased sales and marketing efforts were responsible for million of the change  million was due to international retail expansion and million was due to higher incentive compensation 
the balance of the increase was driven by distribution costs and other expenses related to company wide activities 
going forward  the company expects that its support of the company s global brand initiatives and continued investments in initiatives supporting long term growth in various segments of our business will likely drive expense increases faster than the rate of revenue growth 
our selling expense was million  an increase of million  or compared with the prior year 
within this category of expense  approximately million of the increase was due to foreign exchange  approximately million was related to increased payroll and incentive compensation costs and million was related to distribution costs  particularly freight on increased year over year shipments

the margin improvement was driven by strong global supply chain execution and improved product mix including benefits from stronger boot sales 
our us consumer direct segment s operating income increased by to million 
this resulted from the combination of revenue growth  margin improvement of basis points and the disciplined control of costs which produced a decline in the operating expense rate of basis points 
operating income for our international segment grew by to million 
revenue growth of and gross margin improvements of basis points  both benefiting from foreign exchange  drove the improvement 
foreign exchange rate benefits were partially offset by year over year impacts from our foreign exchange hedging activities 
the margin improvement was supported by our strong supply chain execution and more favorable product mix 
operating expense rates for our international segment also increased by basis points reflecting continued increased investment in retail  new international product development capability and marketing 
our corporate unallocated expenses  which include central support and administrative costs not allocated to our business segments  declined to million or of total revenue  a basis point improvement

compared to revenue consolidated revenue increased to  million in domestic revenue  which comprised of our business  declined 
this decline  which occurred primarily in our wholesale boot business  reflects the steps we took to control supply in order to position this business for future growth 
the mix impact of the boot decline adversely impacted our average selling prices 
additionally  us consumer direct revenue declined  in part due to aggressive promotions by competitors and the overall weakness in the us retail climate 
offsetting these declines domestically  the us wholesale apparel business increased by 
international revenue increased  primarily due to growth in europe across major product categories  channels and markets

the unsecured committed revolving credit agreement the agreement is effective until may  it is our intent to enter into a new agreement at or before that time 
the agreement requires us to comply with certain financial and non financial covenants 
the primary financial covenants relate to maintaining minimum fixed charge coverage of and leverage ratios of and a maximum consolidated total funded debt percentage of  depending upon the fiscal quarter 
the primary non financial covenants place certain limitations on additional debt  stock repurchases  acquisitions and the amount of dividends we may pay 
we measure compliance with the financial and non financial covenants and ratios as required by the terms of the agreement on a fiscal quarter basis 
we had no debt outstanding at december   and our management believes that our capital needs for will be met through our current cash balances  our existing credit facilities and cash from operations  without the need for additional permanent financing 
however  as discussed in the exhibit to our form k entitled cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  several risks and uncertainties could cause the company to need to raise additional capital through equity and or debt financing 
from time to time  the company considers acquisition opportunities which  if pursued  could also result in the need for additional financing 
the availability and terms of any such financing would be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors at that time 
aggregate contractual obligations our deferred compensation plan liability was million as of december   compared with million at december  and million at december  the liability increased primarily due to contributions to the plan 
we also have a deferred compensation liability related to restricted stock awards of million at december  and million at december  we have the following contractual obligations due by period dollars in millions december  total less than year years years after years operating leases see note deferred compensation deferred compensation plan see note restricted stock see note purchase obligations total purchase obligations consist of open production purchase orders for sourced footwear and apparel  materials used to manufacture footwear and apparel and open purchase orders for us operating expense purchases relating to goods or services ordered in the normal course of business 
in addition  we have less than million of open purchase orders for international operating expense purchases relating to goods or services ordered in the normal course of business which are not included in the table 
we expect these international commitments to come due in off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we had letters of credit outstanding of million  million and million  respectively 
all were issued for the purchase of inventory 
as of december   the company had million in hedging contracts outstanding  all of which are due to settle within the next months see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item to this form k 
we have the following off balance sheet arrangements dollars in millions december  total amounts committed lines of credit letters of credit hedging contracts total we use funds from operations and unsecured revolving and committed lines of credit as the primary sources of financing for our seasonal and other working capital requirements 
long term debt  if required  is generally used to finance long term investments 
our principal risks to these sources of financing are the impact on our financial condition from economic downturns  a decrease in the demand for our products  increases in the prices of materials and a variety of other factors 
we anticipate that capital requirements for will be met through the use of our current cash balances  through our existing credit facility which places certain limitations on additional debt  stock repurchases  acquisitions and on the amount of dividends we may pay  and also contains certain other financial and operating covenants and through cash flow from operations  without the need for additional permanent financing 
however  if the need arises  our ability to obtain any additional credit facilities will depend upon prevailing market conditions  our financial condition and the terms and conditions of such additional facilities

forward looking information as discussed in exhibit entitled cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  investors should be aware of factors that could affect our actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us 
these factors include  but are not limited to our ability to successfully market and sell our products in a highly competitive industry and in view of changing consumer trends  consumer acceptance of products  and other factors affecting retail market conditions  including the current us economic environment and the global economic and political uncertainties resulting from the continuing war on terrorism  our ability to locate and retain independent manufacturers to produce lower cost  high quality products with rapid turnaround times  our ability to manage our foreign exchange rate risks  our reliance on a limited number of key suppliers  our ability to obtain adequate raw materials at competitive prices  our ability to successfully invest in our infrastructure and product based upon advance sales forecasts  our ability to recover our investment in  and expenditures of  our retail organization through adequate sales at such retail locations  and our ability to respond to actions of our competitors  some of whom have substantially greater resources than ours 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices that should result in an appropriate level of protection against the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures 
we utilize cash from operations and us dollar denominated borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt  if required  is generally used to finance long term investments 
in addition  we use derivative instruments in our hedging of foreign currency transactions 
these debt instruments and derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
cash balances are invested in high grade securities with terms under months 
we have available unsecured committed and uncommitted lines of credit as sources of financing for our working capital requirements 
borrowings under these credit agreements bear interest at variable rates based on either lenders cost of funds  plus an applicable spread  or prevailing money market rates 
at december   december  and december   we had no short term or long term debt outstanding 
our foreign currency exposure is generated primarily from our european operating subsidiaries and  to a lesser degree  our asian and canadian operating subsidiaries 
we seek to minimize the impact of these foreign currency fluctuations by hedging the related transactions with foreign currency forward contracts 
currently  these foreign currency forward contracts will expire in months or less 
based upon sensitivity analysis as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates would cause the fair value of our financial instruments to increase decrease by approximately million  compared with million at december  the increase at december  is primarily due to the amount of foreign currency contracts held at december   compared with december
