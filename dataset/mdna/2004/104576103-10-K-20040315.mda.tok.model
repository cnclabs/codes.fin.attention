overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that acquires  develops and markets prescription and over the counter products within the dermatologic  podiatric and gastrointestinal markets 
we have experienced substantial growth in annual net sales and net income since through increased sales of existing products and new product sales  recognizing net sales of million for  million for and million for and net income of million for  million for and million for our carmol product line accounted for approximately of our net sales for  for and for and has faced increasing competition  particularly commencing in the latter half of to lessen our dependence on this product line  we have sought to grow our other product lines  both in terms of dollar volume and percentage of revenues 
we market and sell our products in the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry primarily through our full time sales personnel and wholesalers 
we seek to expand our market reach through promotion of our products in new geographic regions and for wider application in existing regions  and will continue expansion of our field sales force as product growth  geographic reach or product acquisitions warrant 
in  we raised capital for acquisitions and general corporate purposes through the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes due and the issuance of  shares of our common stock in a follow on offering that yielded net proceeds to us  after underwriting discount and offering expenses  of approximately million 
a major challenge and opportunity facing bradley is to utilize these funds in the best ways possible  likely in large part through the acquisition of one or more product lines or companies 
results of operations percentage of net revenues the following table sets forth certain data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended december  net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income interest expense income  net income tax expense net income included in operating expenses is a loss on a short term investment of  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for were  representing an increase of  or approximately  from  for for  doak dermatologics net sales were  representing an increase of  or approximately  from  for the increase was a result of new product sales from rosula aqueous gel of  rosula aqueous cleanser of  lidamantle lotion of  lidamantle hc lotion of  and carmol hc oz

the overall increases in deconamine were primarily due to our negotiation of more favorable managed care contracts 
as of december   we had approximately  of unshipped orders  which were subsequently shipped in the first quarter or cancelled by us 
the orders were not shipped due to our concern over wholesaler purchases during the quarter exceeding actual prescription demand 
during the second quarter of  a competitor launched a competing product to carmol cream with the same active ingredient 
during the fourth quarter  generic competitors introduced less expensive comparable products to carmol cream  carmol lotion and carmol gel also with the same active ingredient 
these introductions of competing products may result in reduced demand for our carmol products 
if sales of the carmol product line or any other material product line decreases and we fail to replace those sales  our revenues and profitability would decrease 
cost of sales for was  representing an increase of  or approximately  from  for the gross profit percentage for was  compared to for the increase in the gross profit percentage reflects a change in our sales mix  with greater sales of existing prescription products  including carmol products and the new prescription products launched in selling  general and administrative expenses for were  representing an increase of  or  compared to  for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects increased spending on sales and marketing to implement our strategy of aggressively marketing our dermatology  podiatry and gastrointestinal brands  increases in legal expenses of approximately  and increases in compensation expenses relating to our economic value added bonus plan for approximately  compared to the same period in the prior year

the overall increases in sales of our dermatology products  particularly carmol cream  carmol lotion and acidmantle lidamantle line of products  were primarily due to greater promotional attention and the utilization of market research data to ensure product messages are received by physicians and customers who we believe will generate higher net sales 
due to the offering of slight pricing discounts and extended payment terms to wholesalers and increased demand for our products  we shipped during december  in products to a major customer 
the sales decline in pamine was primarily due to the realignment of our sales force and the focusing of our promotional efforts towards greater growth opportunities in the area of dermatology 
cost of sales for was  representing an increase of  or approximately  from  for the gross profit percentage for was  compared to during the increase in the gross profit percentage reflects a change in our sales mix  with greater sales of doak dermatologics prescription products that generate a higher gross profit percentage

advances available under the revolving asset based credit facility are calculated using a formula  which is based upon our eligible accounts receivable and inventory levels 
as of december   we are eligible to borrow approximately  under the million revolving asset based credit facility 
advances under the million acquisition facility are subject to our finding a potential acquisition  satisfying financial covenants and  depending upon the size of the acquisition  wachovia s approval 
this loan agreement has an initial term of two years  expiring on october  interest accrues on amounts outstanding at a rate equal to libor plus and the commitment fee accrues on the unused portion of the asset based credit facility and the acquisition facility at a rate equal to 
per annum 
our obligations under this loan agreement are secured by our grant to wachovia of a lien upon substantially all of our assets 
as of the date of this form k  we have not borrowed any funds from the revolving asset based credit facility or the acquisition facility 
in june and july of  we issued in two related private placements an aggregate of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes due june  the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year  and are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of per share 
beginning on june   we will have the right  at our option  to redeem all or a portion of the notes at a cash redemption price equal to of the principal amount of notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
on june   holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of notes to be purchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash upon either a change in control of our company or the termination of trading of our common stock  each as described in the indenture governing the notes 
the notes rank junior to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and are subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries  including trade payables 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into two registration rights agreements under which we agreed to file and keep effective a shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
if we fail to comply with certain of our obligations under the registration rights agreements  additional interest will accrue on the notes at an annual rate of up to one percent 
during  we had expensed  of interest relating to the notes 
additionally  we paid  of financing fees relating to these notes  which are included as deferred financing fees on our balance sheet  and are being amortized over a ten year period  which is the life of the notes 
during  we completed an offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the company received net proceeds of  from the offering after deducting offering expenses 
we expect to use the proceeds from the offering for acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations and commitments year ending december  operating leases capital leases a convertible notes due b other debt minimum inventory purchases c thereafter  a lease amounts include interest and minimum lease payments 
b on june   holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of notes to be purchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
c for more information on minimum inventory purchases  see co promotion agreement in note j 
of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund our current working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if we make or anticipate significant acquisitions  we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses for the relevant reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates discussed below with our audit committee  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to these estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales  net of estimated provisions  is recognized when the merchandise is shipped to an unrelated third party  as provided in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of the products has occurred  the selling price is both fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably probable 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  rebates  damaged product returns and exchanges for expired products  are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time revenues are recognized  based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact these reserves 
these revenue reductions are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance  or as an addition to accrued expenses if the payment is due to a party other than the wholesale or retail customer 
we do not provide any form of price protection to our wholesale customers and we typically permit product returns only if the product is damaged or if it is returned within six to twelve months of expiration and twelve months after expiration 
chargebacks and rebates are based on the difference between the prices at which we sell our products to wholesalers and the sales price ultimately paid under fixed price contracts by third party payers  who are often governmental agencies and managed care buying groups 
we record an estimate of the amount either to be charged back to us  or rebated to the end user  at the time of sale to the wholesaler 
we have recorded reserves for chargebacks  returns and rebates based upon various factors  including current contract prices  historical trends and our future expectations 
the amount of actual chargebacks  returns and rebates claimed could be either higher or lower than the amounts we accrued 
changes in our estimates would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
product returns 
in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for a refund if the product has not been used prior to its expiration date  which is typically two to three years from the date of manufacture 
our return policy typically allows product returns for products within an eighteen month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to twelve months after the expiration date 
our return policy conforms to industry standard practices 
we believe that we have sufficient data to estimate future returns over the revised time period at the time of sale 
management is required to estimate the level of sales  which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of a given product  product specific information provided by our customers and information obtained regarding the levels of inventory being held by our customers  as well as overall purchasing patterns by our customers 
management periodically reviews the reserves established for returns and adjusts them based on actual experience 
if we over or under estimate the level of sales  which will ultimately be returned  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
intangible assets 
we have made acquisitions of products and businesses that include goodwill  license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  including goodwill prior to january   when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance compared to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these factors  we first perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flow  and if the amount is less than the asset s value  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminated the amortization of purchased goodwill 
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we performed an impairment test of our goodwill  which amounted to  at january   and determined that no impairment of the recorded goodwill existed 
the fair value of our doak dermatologics subsidiary that we acquired in january was calculated on the basis of discounted estimated future cash flows and compared to the related book value 
under sfas no 
 goodwill will be tested  for impairment at least annually  and more frequently if an event occurs that indicates the goodwill may be impaired 
we performed the test at december   and noted that no impairment existed 
as of january   we also adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on our financial statements 
deferred income taxes are provided for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and then respective tax base 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december  and  we determined that no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was necessary  and we eliminated our previously established valuation allowance 
we believe that our projections of future taxable income makes it more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
if our projections of future taxable income changes in the future  we may be required to reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 
impact of inflation we have experienced only moderate price increases under our agreements with third party manufacturers as a result of raw material and labor price increases 
we have passed these price increases along to our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that possible future inflation would not impact our operations 
seasonality sales of our respiratory products are primarily concentrated in the fall and winter months 
consequently  revenues from these products generally are  and will be  determined by the severity of the cough cold flu season 
we expect the impact of seasonality to decrease as we acquire or obtain licenses for products that treat chronic conditions 
however  we anticipate that seasonality may continue to affect sales for the foreseeable future 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin is effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   but also has disclosure requirements effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  fasb issued fasb interpretation r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  for some types of entities that do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin r will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
fin r applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies to us in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company adopted fin r in december the adoption of fin r did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus opinion on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the consensus provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement should be allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with different provisions if the fair value of all deliverables are not known or if the fair value is contingent on delivery of specified items or performance conditions 
applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each separate unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas in particular  this statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires issuers to classify as liabilities  or assets in some circumstances  three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer 
generally  the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we do not have any financial instruments within the scope of sfas as of december   and  therefore  sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our purchases of entsol spray are made in euros 
we expect to make purchases several times per year 
while the effect of foreign currency translations has not been material to our results of operations to date  currency translations on import purchases could be affected adversely in the future by the relationship of the us dollar to foreign currencies 
in addition  foreign currency fluctuations can have an adverse effect upon exports  even though we recognize sales to international wholesalers in us dollars 
foreign currency fluctuations can directly affect the marketability of our products in international markets 
to the extent that we borrow under our credit facility with wachovia bank  we will experience market risk with respect to changes in the applicable interest rates and its effect upon our interest expense 
because these rates are variable  an increase in interest rates will result in additional interest expense and a reduction in interest rates will result in reduced interest expense 
as of december   we had the following outstanding debt with fixed rate interest and no outstanding debt with variable interest rates period debt a average fixed rate interest fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  fiscal n a fiscal n a thereafter  a debt amounts include all interest except for convertible notes and minimum debt payments 
our interest income is also exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments that are comprised of us government treasury notes  which we hold on an available for sale basis 
we have not entered into derivative financial instruments
