overview verisign  inc is a leading provider of critical infrastructure services that enable web site owners  enterprises  communications service providers  electronic commerce  or e commerce  service providers and individuals to engage in secure digital commerce and communications 
in  our business consisted of three reportable segments the internet services group  the communications services group and the network solutions domain name registrar business 
the economic environment during the first half of was challenging across all segments of our business  but began to improve in certain sectors during the third and fourth quarters 
as the year progressed  we noted improved it spending in the united states  europe and japan and saw a general rebound in e commerce globally 
these developments led to a return to growth in revenues and deferred revenues in our internet services group s security services  payment services and naming and directory services businesses 
these trends were offset  however  by a continued deterioration in market share in our network solutions domain name registrar business due to ongoing competition from other accredited registrars 
further  the telecommunications industry had another difficult year due to an excess of capacity which resulted in increased pricing pressures for our communications services group s offerings and increased rates of business consolidation in the sector 
many second tier carriers continued to have financial difficulties and several telecommunications customers filed for bankruptcy during we were also unable to renew our contract with dobson  a sizable wireless billing customer  due to its affiliation with another telecommunications provider utilizing a competitive system 
we derive the majority of our revenues and cash flows from a relatively small number of products and services sold primarily in the united states  europe and japan 
in the internet services group  more than of the revenues during were derived from the sale of web certificates  payment services  managed pki services and registry services 
in the communications services group  over of our revenues were derived from the sale of calling name services  billing services  ss connectivity and signaling services during as for our network solutions domain name registrar business  which we sold in late  virtually all revenues for this business unit were derived from the sale of our domain name registration services 
during  we expect to see continued  modest improvements in the level of it and telecommunications spending and e commerce activity in the united states  europe and japan 
for the year  we anticipate a decline in verisign s overall revenues due to the sale of our network solutions business  with moderate growth in revenues in the internet services group and flat to moderate growth in revenues in the communications services group 

table of contents network solutions sale on november   we completed the sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business to pivotal private equity 
we received approximately million of consideration  consisting of approximately million in cash and a million senior subordinated note that bears interest at per annum for the first three years  per annum thereafter and matures five years from the date of closing 
the principal and interest are due upon maturity 
this note is subordinated to a term loan made by ableco finance to the network solutions business in the principal amount of approximately million as of the closing date 
we retained a equity stake in the network solutions business 
we will not recognize any revenue from the network solutions business in the future and accordingly  we expect the sale of the business will result in a decline in pro forma and us gaap net revenues of between and million in compared to  and will reduce pro forma operating profits between and million and us gaap operating losses between million and million in compared to the network solutions business provides domain name registrations  and value added services such as business e mail  websites  hosting and other web presence services 
approximately former verisign employees are now employed by the network solutions business as a result of the transaction

verisign japan kk initial public offering in the fourth quarter of  verisign s majority owned consolidated subsidiary  verisign japan kk  completed an initial public offering of its common stock 
approximately million was raised by verisign japan kk from the initial public offering and through subsequent option exercises during the fourth quarter of verisign japan kk s shares began trading on the tokyo stock exchange tse on november  under the company code acquisitions in october  we completed our acquisition of unc embratel  the clearinghouse division of embratel  for approximately million 
unc embratel provides call record tracking  clearing and settlement services for a majority of the mobile and fixed telecommunications carriers in brazil 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the date of acquisition 
the results of unc embratel s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from its date of acquisition

the total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
ho system s results of operations were included in the consolidated financial statements from its date of acquisition 
we accounted for all of our acquisitions in  and as purchase business combinations 
accordingly  the acquired companies revenues  costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition 
additionally  the results of operations of the network solutions domain name registrar business have been excluded from our consolidated results of operations since we finalized the sale of the business on november  as a result of our sale of the network solutions domain name registrar business in  our acquisitions of ho systems in february and illuminet holdings in december  comparisons of revenues  costs and expenses for the year ended december  to the years ended december   and may not be relevant  as the businesses represented in the consolidated financial statements were not equivalent 

table of contents subsequent events on february   we successfully completed our acquisition of guardent  a leading privately held provider of managed security services 
we paid approximately million for all the outstanding shares of capital stock of guardent  of which approximately million was in cash and the remainder in verisign stock 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase transaction 
prior to the sale of our network solutions domain name registrar business  verisign and network solutions were defendants in numerous lawsuits related to customer disputes over domain name registrations and related services 
from january  through march   verisign resolved six lawsuits directly related to the network solutions business totaling approximately million 
this amount has been included in sale of business and litigation settlements on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  long lived assets  and deferred taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition during  verisign derived its revenues from three reportable segments i the internet services group  which consists of the security services business and the naming and directory services business 
the security services business provides products and services that enable enterprises and organizations to establish and deliver secure internet based services to customer and business partners  and the naming and directory services business acts as the exclusive registry of domain names in the 
com and 
net generic top level domains  or gtlds  and certain country code top level domains  or cctlds  ii the communications services group  which provides signaling system  or ss  network services  intelligent data base and directory services  application services and billing and payment services to wireline and wireless telecommunications carriers  and iii domain name registration services through the network solutions business segment  which verisign sold in november verisign s revenue recognition policies are in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  unless otherwise noted below 
the revenue recognition policy for each of these categories is as follows internet services revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the digital certificate  generally months 
revenues from the sale of managed public key infrastructure pki services are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the license  generally to months 
post contract customer support pcs is bundled with managed pki services licenses and recognized over the license term 

table of contents revenues from the licensing of digital certificate technology and business process technology are derived from arrangements involving multiple elements including pcs  training and other services 
these licenses  which do not provide for right of return  are primarily perpetual licenses for which revenues are recognized up front once all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we recognize revenues from issuances of digital certificates and business process licensing to verisign affiliates in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we define each of these four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our customary practice to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement with us 
delivery has occurred 
our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
electronic delivery is deemed to have occurred upon download by the customer from an ftp server 
if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
it is our policy to not provide customers the right to a refund of any portion of their paid license fees 
we may agree to payment terms with a foreign customer based on local customs 
generally  at least of the arrangement fees are due within one year or less 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these customary payment terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable  and revenues from such arrangements are recognized as payments become due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
we typically sell to customers for whom there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customer s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenues are recognized as cash is collected 
during  revenues for all verisign affiliates represented approximately of consolidated revenues 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenues to pcs and professional services components of our perpetual license arrangements 
we sell our professional services separately  and have established vsoe on this basis 
vsoe for pcs is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for these elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop our consulting services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration 
customers purchase these consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to provide these services 
software products are billed separately and independently from consulting services  which are generally billed on a time and materials or milestone achieved basis 

table of contents revenues from consulting services are recognized using either the percentage of completion method or on a time and materials basis as work is performed 
percentage of completion is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project 
we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects 
if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made  then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed 
revenues from training are recognized as training is performed 
revenues from managed security services primarily consist of a set up fee and a monthly service fee for the managed security service 
in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  revenues from set up fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the fees are earned 
revenues from the monthly service fees are recognized in the period in which the services are provided 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
 unless otherwise noted 
revenues from third party product sales are recognized when title to the products sold passes to the customer 
our shipping terms generally dictate that the passage of title occurs upon shipment of the products to the customer 
revenues from payment services primarily consist of a set up fee and a monthly service fee for the transaction processing services 
revenues from set up fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the fees are earned 
revenues from the service fees are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided 
advance customer deposits received are deferred and allocated ratably to revenue over the periods the services are provided 
communications services revenues from communications services are comprised of network connectivity  intelligent network services  wireless billing and customer care services and clearinghouse services 
network connectivity revenues are derived from establishing and maintaining connection to our ss network and trunk signaling services 
revenues from network connectivity consist primarily of monthly recurring fees  and trunk signaling service revenues are charged monthly based on the number of switches to which a customer signals 
intelligent network services  which include calling card validation  local number portability  wireless services  toll free database access and caller identification are derived primarily from database administration and database query services and are charged on a per use or per query basis 
revenues from prepaid wireless account management services and unregistered wireless roaming services are based on the revenue retained by us and recognized in the period in which such calls are processed on a per minute or per call basis 
revenues from wireless billing and customer care services primarily represent a monthly recurring fee for every subscriber activated by our wireless carrier customers 
clearinghouse services revenues are derived primarily from serving as a distribution and collection point for billing information and payment collection for services provided by one carrier to customers billed by another 
clearinghouse services revenues are earned based on the number of messages processed 
included in prepaid expenses and other current assets are amounts due from customers that are related to our telecommunications services for third party network access  data base charges and clearinghouse toll amounts that have been invoiced and remitted to the customer 
domain name registration services domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration fees charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration services 
revenues from the initial registration or renewal of domain name registration services are deferred and recognized ratably over the registration term  generally one to two years and up to ten years 

table of contents domain name registration renewal fees are estimated and recorded based on renewal and collection rates 
customers are notified of the expiration of their registration in advance  and we record the receivables and related deferred revenue for estimated renewal fees in the month preceding the anniversary date of their registration when we have a right to bill under the terms of our domain name registration agreements 
the variance between the actual collections and the rate used to estimate the renewal fees is reflected in the setting of renewal rates for prospective periods 
fees for renewals and advance extensions to the existing term are deferred until the new incremental period commences 
these fees are then recognized ratably over the new registration term  ranging from one to ten years 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above 
in addition  we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category 
we also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration to any one customer  industry or geographic region 
to date our receivables have not had any particular concentrations that  if not collected  would have a significant impact on our operating income 
we require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts represented of total accounts receivable 
a change of in our estimate would amount to approximately million 
valuation of long lived intangible assets including goodwill our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment 
we review  at least annually  goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review long lived assets  including certain identifiable intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 
recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million at december   which was comprised of million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
other intangible assets include customer relationships  technology in place  and customer lists 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired  an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations  of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period  
table of contents the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
it is our policy to engage third party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our long lived intangible assets including goodwill 
based on these measurements  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million and  million during and  respectively 
additionally  the agreement we entered into to sell our network solutions business triggered an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill assigned to network solutions 
after considering the sales price of the assets and liabilities to be sold and the expenses associated with the divestiture  we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of network solutions goodwill 
as a result we recorded an additional impairment of goodwill of approximately million in the third quarter of restructuring in november  we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our network solutions business and the realignment of other business units 
the plan resulted in reductions in workforce  abandonment of excess facilities  disposal of property and equipment and other charges 
as a result of the restructuring plan  and in conformity with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we incurred restructuring and other charges amounting to approximately million in the fourth quarter of in april  we initiated plans to restructure our operations to rationalize  integrate and align resources 
this restructuring plan included workforce reductions  abandonment of excess facilities  write off of abandoned property and equipment and other charges 
as a result of this plan  in conformity with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
and eitf issues no 
and  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million during and million during deferred taxes we account for deferred taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance is required to be applied to certain deferred tax assets  we considered such factors as our history of operating losses  our uncertainty as to the projected long term operating results  and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
although our operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods  our evaluation of all of the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets indicated that such plans were not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative evidence 
the possible future reversal of the valuation allowance will result in future income statement benefit to the extent the valuation allowance was applied to deferred tax assets generated through ongoing operations 
to the extent the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets generated through stock compensation deductions  the possible future reversal of such valuation allowance will result in a credit to additional paid in capital and will not result in future income statement benefit 
results of operations we had net losses for fiscal of approximately million  a decrease of  million compared to our losses in fiscal our net losses were due primarily to the charges we have incurred for the amortization and impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions and restructuring charges

in addition  with respect to our digital certificate services  cost of revenues also includes fees paid to third parties to verify certificate applicants identities  insurance premiums for our service warranty plan  errors and omission insurance and the cost of software and hardware resold to customers

change change dollars in thousands cost of revenues percentage of revenues 
table of contents on an absolute dollar basis cost of revenues decreased million in  as compared to the primary reason for this decrease was due to our transition out of the third party product reseller and the third party product training businesses 
this transition accounted for a decrease of approximately million 
also  labor and benefits costs decreased approximately million in  as compared to  due to a reduction in employee headcount related to our restructuring plans announced in and contract and professional services fees declined approximately million in  as compared to  due primarily to a discontinuation in of certain outsourced customer service centers for our network solutions registrar business 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales decreased modestly during compared to primarily due to our transition out of the third party product reseller and the third party product training businesses  which typically have higher costs and lower margins than our internal products and services 
additionally  fixed labor and benefit costs declined as a result of the reduction in employee headcount in relating to our restructuring plans 
growth of revenues was the primary factor in the increase of cost of revenues on an absolute dollar basis in as compared to we acquired illuminet holdings in december and ho systems in february  which added significant cost of revenues during we incurred increased expenses for access to third party databases to verify digital certificate applicants identities  increased customer service costs related to our larger customer base and increased expenses related to the cost of hardware and software products resold to customers as part of our consulting business 
registry fees  third party fees  other direct costs  and labor are our largest expense categories for cost of revenues 
the acquisition of illuminet holdings resulted in an increase in labor expenses of million in and an increase of million for third party fees and other direct costs 
additionally  depreciation expenses in cost of revenues increased due to the illuminet acquisition by million in compared to while overall our cost of revenues increased  we reduced outside consulting costs by million in from due to a company wide cost reduction effort 
future acquisitions  further expansion into international markets and introduction of new products may result in additional increases in cost of revenues  due to the hiring of additional personnel and related expenses and other factors 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased significantly during compared to due to the inclusion of a full year of activity from our illuminet holdings acquisition and due to over months of activity from our ho systems acquisition 
our communications services businesses have different cost structures than our other businesses resulting in an increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues since their acquisitions 
certain of our services  such as consulting and training  require greater initial personnel involvement and therefore have higher costs than other types of services 
in addition  revenues derived from our authentication services  domain name registration services  registry services  payment services  and our communications services each have different cost structures and our overall cost of revenues may fluctuate as these businesses mature

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk equity investments we invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for strategic business purposes 
some of these companies may be publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
we value these public company investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month 
these investments are subject to market price volatility 
we reflect these investments on our balance sheet at their market value  with the unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
in most instances  we invest in the equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market  and therefore  carry a high level of risk 
these companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the near term 
therefore  these companies may never become publicly traded 
even if they do  an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments 
in  and  we determined the decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized net impairment losses totaling million  million and million  respectively 
due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments  and in light of current stock market conditions  we may incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments 
we do not currently hedge against equity price changes 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our non strategic investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate bonds and notes  market auction securities  us government and agency securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
in addition  we generally invest in relatively short term securities 
as of december   of our non strategic investments mature in less than one year 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
maturing in total estimated fair value six months or less six months to one year more than one year dollars in thousands included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in restricted cash weighted average interest rate foreign currency management and derivative instruments we are increasingly exposed to currency risk as we continue to expand our international operations 
we transact business in multiple foreign currencies 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a foreign currency risk 
table of contents management program  using forward currency contracts to eliminate  reduce  or transfer selected foreign currency risks that are related to the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations denominated in non functional currencies and which could be identified and quantified 
forward contracts are limited to durations of less than months 
at december   only non functional currency balances were hedged 
all derivatives were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and in earnings at year end the primary business objective of this hedging program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates 
at december   we held a forward contract in a notional amount of million to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations for certain foreign operations 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign contracts with high quality financial institutions
