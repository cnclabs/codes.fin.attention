major challenges faced by the company during included the occurrence of a single case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease in the united states  a single case of bse in canada  high natural gas prices  and increased diesel fuel costs 
during  high finished product commodity prices were partially offset by the negative impact of high raw material prices and high energy costs 
the impact of bse is still not completely identified or known  but recent events are summarized in the sections which follow 
management of the company expects continued uncertainties relative to bse and potential new government regulations and expects its impact to remain fluid during management also expects high energy prices incurred during to continue through fiscal the effects of these challenges during fiscal are summarized in the sections which follow 
while operating income increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  these challenges indicate there can be no assurance that operating results achieved by the company in fiscal are indicative of future operating performance of the company 
summary of critical issues faced by the company during higher finished product commodity prices were experienced  especially in the fourth quarter of  as a result of a tightening in supplies of and demand for fats  oils and proteins worldwide 
in addition  a single case of bse in canada in late spring of caused a dramatic price increase for us produced mbm 
high finished product prices were favorable to the company s sales revenue  but this favorable result was partially offset by the negative impact on raw material cost  due to the company s formula pricing arrangements with raw material suppliers  which index raw material cost to the prices of finished products derived from the raw material 
the financial impact of the increase of finished goods prices on sales revenue and raw material cost is summarized below in results of operations 
high energy prices for both natural gas and diesel fuel persisted throughout fiscal management believes that high prices were due in part to fears of potential natural gas shortages resulting from severe winter weather in february and march   and from fears of potential crude oil shortages resulting from war in iraq and ongoing strife in the middle east 
the company attempts to manage natural gas price risk by entering into forward purchase agreements with all of its natural gas suppliers that permit such contracts  in order to purchase natural gas for future months when prices are relatively low 
the company has limited diesel fuel storage capabilities at its plant locations and regional suppliers have not been willing to enter forward purchase agreements on terms acceptable to the company 
the financial impact of higher natural gas and diesel fuel prices is summarized below in results of operations 
the company entered a new subordinated debt agreement on december  the net proceeds of the new subordinated debt issue of million were used to reduce the company s term loan by million 
the subordinated debt has a term of six years  will mature on december   and bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
management believes that the consummation of the new subordinated debt agreement represents a first step of efforts by the company to improve the capital structure of the company  including liquidity  terms and conditions of its existing debt structure 
page summary of critical issues and known trends faced by the company in and thereafter a case of bse was diagnosed in a cow in the state of washington on december  a summary of the immediate impact of this case of bse follows within days of the initial media reports of the case of bse  many countries banned imports of us produced beef and beef products  including meat and bone meal and initially tallow  though this initial ban on tallow was relaxed to permit imports of us produced tallow with less than impurities 
us government regulations issued in response to the case of bse include a 
on december   the secretary of agriculture announced new beef slaughter meat processing regulations to assure consumers of the safety of the meat supply 
the regulations prohibit downer animals from entering the food chain  require removal of specified risk materials srm at slaughter  and prohibit carcasses from cattle tested for bse from entering the food chain until the animals are shown negative for bse 
b 
on january   the fda announced intentions to modify its feed rule cfr by removing the exemptions for certain products  including blood and blood products  and requiring dedicated processing lines for handling and processing restricted use and exempted proteins 
on this date  the fda also announced its intent to ban the use of certain animal tissue derived materials in food and supplements 
such a ban could affect the use of tallow derived from srm  dead cattle and non ambulatory cattle in cosmetics 
the proposal has not been finalized as of march  as a result of the bse case  many foreign countries closed their borders to us beef products  including meat and bone meal mbm 
despite the mbm market price fluctuations that occurred during late december and january  the company does not anticipate the need to make significant changes in its business plan or daily operations at this time 
the company s management monitors market conditions and prices for its finished products on a daily basis 
if market conditions or prices were to significantly change  the company s management would evaluate and implement such measures  if any  that it deems necessary to respond to the change in market conditions 
on larger formula based pricing suppliers  the indexing of finished product price to raw material cost effectively fixes the gross margin on finished product sales at a stable level  providing some protection to the company from price declines 
energy prices for natural gas and diesel fuel remain high into the company consumes significant volumes of natural gas to operate boilers in its plants to generate steam to heat raw material 
high natural gas prices represent a significant cost of factory operation included in cost of sales 
the company consumes significant volumes of diesel fuel to operate its fleet of tractors and trailers used to collect raw material 
high diesel fuel prices represent a significant component of cost of collection expenses included in cost of sales 
though the company will continue to manage these costs and attempt to minimize the expenses  prices remain relatively high into and represent an ongoing challenge to the company s operating results for future periods 
the company is working to refinance its debt on terms and conditions which are more favorable to the company than the credit agreement executed in may and maturing in may the objectives include providing increased availability and liquidity  lower interest rates  an extended term  and more flexible capital investment limitations than exist under the existing term loan 
the company is working to develop an agreement which will be acceptable to both prospective lenders and the company 
the company can not provide assurance it will be successful in its efforts to refinance the remaining balance of its term loan which is owed under the credit agreement executed on may  on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
these challenges indicate there can be no assurance that operating results of the company in fiscal are indicative of future operating performance of the company

the principal products that the company sells are commodities  the prices of which are quoted on established commodity markets and are subject to volatile changes 
although the current market prices of these commodities are favorable  a decline in these prices has the potential to adversely impact the company s liquidity 
a disruption in international sales  a decline in commodities prices  or a rise in energy prices resulting from the recent war with iraq and the subsequent political instability and uncertainty  has the potential to adversely impact the company s liquidity 
there can be no assurance that a decline in commodities prices  a rise in energy prices  a slowdown in the us or international economy  or other factors  including political instability in the middle east or elsewhere  and the macroeconomic effects of those events  will not cause the company to fail to meet management s expectations  or otherwise result in liquidity concerns

critical accounting policies the company follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing its consolidated financial statements 
a complete summary of these policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of the policies require management to make significant and subjective estimates or assumptions which may deviate from actual results 
in particular  management makes estimates regarding the fair value of the company s reporting units in assessing potential impairment of goodwill  estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows from the future use of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  estimates regarding the net realizable value of long lived assets held for sale  estimates regarding pension expense  estimates of bad debts and estimates regarding self insured risks including insurance  environmental and litigation contingencies 
page in assessing impairment of goodwill  the company uses estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units 
in assessing the impairment of long lived assets where there has been a change in circumstances indicating the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  the company has estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from use of the asset based on actual historical results and expectations about future economic circumstances including future business volume  finished product prices and operating costs 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units and of future net cash flows from use of the asset could change if actual prices and costs differ due to industry conditions or other factors affecting the level of business volume or the company s performance 
in assessing impairment of long lived assets held for sale  the company has estimated the net realizable value of such assets based on information from various external sources regarding possible selling prices for such assets 
the estimate of reserve for bad debts is based upon the company s bad debt experience  market conditions  aging of trade accounts receivable  and interest rates  among other factors 
pension expense is based upon actuarial estimates 
these estimates could change based on changes in market conditions  interest rates  and other factors 
in estimating liabilities for self insured risks  the company considers information from outside consultants and experts  and past historical experience  in projecting future costs expected to be incurred 
these estimates could change if future events are different than assumed by management  actual costs to settle the liabilities differ from those estimated and the circumstances associated with the self insured risks change

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risks affecting the company are exposures to changes in prices of the finished products the company sells  interest rates on debt  availability of raw material supply  and the price of natural gas used in the company s plants 
raw materials available to the company are impacted by seasonal factors  including holidays  when raw material volume declines  warm weather  which can adversely affect the quality of raw material processed and finished products produced  and cold weather  which can impact the collection of raw material 
predominantly all of the company s finished products are commodities which are generally sold at prices prevailing at the time of sale 
the company has used interest rate and natural gas swaps to manage these related risks 
the company is not currently party to any natural gas swap agreements or any interest rate swap agreements 
the company uses natural gas forward purchase agreements with its suppliers to manage the price risk of natural gas used in its facilities 
as of january   the company had forward purchase agreements in place for purchases of approximately million of natural gas for the months of january through june  which approximates of the company s usage for these months 
as of january   the company had forward purchase agreements in place for purchases of approximately million of finished product in the month of january page interest rate sensitivity the company s obligations subject to fixed or variable interest rates include in thousands  except interest rates less than more than total year years y ears years long term debt fixed rate  average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate accrued liabilities redeemable preferred stock  average interest rate total    the company s fixed rate debt obligations consist of the senior subordinated notes and various other notes payable that accrue interest at an annual weighted average fixed rate of approximately 
additionally  the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock accumulates dividends at a fixed rate of annually 
these obligations are not affected by changes in interest rates 
the company has million in variable rate debt that represents the balance outstanding under the term loan originating as part of the senior credit agreement on may  this portion of the company s debt is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company estimates that a increase in interest rates will increase the company s interest expense by approximately million in fiscal risk factors any investment in the company will be subject to risks inherent to the company s business 
before making an investment decision in the company  you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in or incorporated by reference into this report 
if any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
if any of these events occurs  the trading price of the company s securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
fluctuations in market prices of finished products the company s profitability and cash flow may be reduced by decreases in the market price of its products 
the company s finished products are commodities  the prices of which are quoted on established commodity markets 
accordingly  the company s profitability will be affected by fluctuations in the prevailing market prices of such finished products 
a significant decrease in the market price of the company s products would have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability and cash flow 
competition the most competitive aspect of the company s business is the procurement of raw materials 
the company s management believes that the most competitive aspect of the company s business is the procurement of raw materials rather than the sale of finished products 
during the last ten plus years  pronounced consolidation within the meat packing industry has resulted in bigger and more efficient slaughtering operations  the majority of which utilize captive processors 
simultaneously  the number of small meat packers  which have historically been a dependable source of supply for non captive processors  such as the company  has decreased significantly 
although the total amount of slaughtering may be flat or only moderately increasing  the availability  quantity and quality of raw materials available to the independent processors from these sources have all decreased 
major competitors include baker commodities in the west  national by products in the midwest  and griffin industries in texas and the southeast 
each of these businesses compete in both the rendering and restaurant service segments 
a significant decrease in raw materials available could materially and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
page the rendering and restaurant services industry is highly fragmented and very competitive 
the company competes with other rendering and restaurant services businesses and alternative methods of disposal of animal processing by products and used restaurant cooking oil provided by trash haulers and waste management companies  as well as the alternative of illegal disposal 
the company charges a collection fee to offset a portion of the cost incurred in collecting raw material 
in recent years the company has become highly dependent upon these collection fees 
to the extent suppliers of raw materials look to alternate methods of disposal  whether as a result of the company s collection fees being deemed too expensive or otherwise  the company s raw material supply will decrease and the company s collection fee revenues will decrease  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
government regulations and approvals the company may incur material costs and liabilities in complying with government regulations 
the company is subject to the rules and regulations of various federal  state and local governmental agencies 
material rules and regulations and the applicable agencies are the food and drug administration fda  which regulates food and feed safety  the united states department of agriculture usda  including its agencies aphis and fsis  which regulates collection and production methods  the environmental protection agency epa  which regulates air and water discharge requirements  as well as local and state agencies governing air and water discharge  state departments of agriculture  which regulate animal by product collection and transportation procedures and animal feed quality  and the united states department of transportation usdot  as well as local and state agencies  which regulate the operation of the company s commercial vehicles 
such rules and regulations may influence the company s operating results at one or more facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs and liabilities in connection with such regulations 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease the company s business may be affected by fda regulations relating to bse 
effective august   the fda promulgated a rule prohibiting the use of mammalian proteins  with some exceptions  in feeds for cattle  sheep and other ruminant animals 
the intent of this rule is to prevent the spread of bse  commonly referred to as mad cow disease 
the company s management believes that the company is in compliance with the provisions of the rule 
a case of bse was diagnosed in a cow in the state of washington on december  within days of the media reports of the case of bse  many countries moved to ban imports of us produced beef and beef products  including meat and bone meal and initially tallow  though this initial ban on tallow was relaxed to permit imports of us produced tallow with less than impurities 
the us government issued regulations in response to the case of bse which include on december   the secretary of agriculture announced new beef slaughter meat processing regulations to assure consumers of the safety of the meat supply 
the regulations prohibit downer animals from entering the food chain  require removal of specified risk materials srm at slaughter  and prohibit carcasses from cattle tested for bse from entering the food chain until the animals are shown negative for bse 
on january   the fda announced intentions to modify its feed rule cfr by removing the exemptions for certain products  including blood and blood products  and requiring dedicated processing lines for handling and processing restricted use and exempted proteins 
on this date  the fda also announced its intent to ban the use of certain animal tissue derived materials in food and supplements 
such a ban could affect the use of tallow derived from srm  dead cattle and non ambulatory cattle in cosmetics 
the proposal has not been finalized as of march  page the occurrence of bse in the united states may result in additional us government regulations  finished product export restrictions by foreign governments  market price fluctuations for the company s finished products  reduced demand for beef and beef products by consumers  or increase the company s operating costs 
the impact of the occurrence of the case of bse is not fully known at this time  but may positively or negatively impact the company s results of operations in the future

substantial leverage and debt service the company has substantial debt and has significant interest payment requirements which could adversely affect its ability to operate its business 
the company has a significant amount of indebtedness 
this indebtedness could have important consequences to the holders of the company s securities including the risks that the company will be required to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay its indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund the implementation of the company s business strategy  working capital  capital expenditures  product development efforts and other general corporate purposes  the company s interest expense could increase if interest rates in general increase because a portion of the company s debt will bear interest based on market rates  the company s level of indebtedness will increase its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  the company s debt service obligations could limit the company s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the company s business  the company s level of indebtedness may place it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt  and a failure by the company to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing the company s indebtedness  which could result in an event of default and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
as of march   the company owed senior subordinated debt of million and a contractual amount of million in senior secured term loans with a carrying amount of million and had no senior secured revolving loans outstanding under the company s credit agreement 
as of such date  three letters of credit in the face amounts of million  million and million  respectively were issued and outstanding under the senior credit facility 
the company will be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future  including million of additional debt available under the company s revolving credit facility 
additional indebtedness will increase the risks described above 
all borrowings under the company s credit agreement are secured and senior to the company s securities 
for risks associated with the restrictive covenants in the company s debt instruments  see the risk factor entitled restrictive covenants in the company s debt instruments 
page restrictive covenants in the company s debt instruments restrictions imposed by the company s credit agreements  and future debt agreements may  limit its ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in the company s interest 
the company s credit agreements currently  and future debt agreements may  restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness  issue additional capital stock or preferred stock  pay dividends and make other distributions  prepay subordinated debt  make restricted payments  create liens  merge  consolidate or acquire other businesses  sell and otherwise dispose of assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  make investments  and engage in new lines of business  unrelated to the company s current businesses 
these terms may impose restrictions on the company s ability to finance future operations  implement its business strategy  fund its capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in its interest 
in addition  the company s credit agreements requires  and future indebtedness may require  the company to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios 
although the company is currently in compliance with the financial ratios and does not plan on engaging in transactions that may cause the company to not be in compliance with the ratios  its ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond its control  including the risks described in the other risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the company s inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the credit agreements 
in the event of a default under the credit agreements  the lenders under the credit agreements may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable  or require the company to apply all of its available cash to repay these borrowings 
the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further financing  including under the revolving credit facility 
if the company is unable to repay these borrowings when due  the lenders under the credit agreements also will have the right to proceed against the collateral  which consists of substantially all of the company s assets  including real property 
if the indebtedness under the credit agreements were to be accelerated  the company s assets may be insufficient to repay this indebtedness in full under those circumstances 
any future credit agreements or other agreement relating to the company s indebtedness to which the company may become a party may include the covenants described above and other restrictive covenants 
key personnel the company s success is dependent on the company s key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key employees  including members of senior management 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and prospects 
the company believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to attract  motivate and retain skilled technical  managerial  marketing and sales personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting  motivating and retaining key personnel 
the failure to hire and retain such personnel could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
page dependence on suppliers certain of the company s operating facilities are highly dependent upon a few suppliers 
certain of the company s rendering facilities are highly dependent on one or a few suppliers 
should any of these suppliers choose alternate methods of disposal  cease their operations  have their operations interrupted by casualty  or otherwise cease using the company s collection services  such operating facilities may be materially and adversely affected dependence on certain facilities in certain markets the company is highly dependent upon the continued and uninterrupted operation of a single operating facility 
in the majority of the company s markets  in the event of a casualty or condemnation involving a facility located in such market  the company would utilize a nearby operating facility to continue to serve its customers in such market 
in certain markets  however  the company does not have alternate operating facilities 
in the event of a casualty or condemnation  or an unscheduled shutdown  the company may experience an interruption in its ability to service its customers and to procure raw materials 
this may materially and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations in such markets 
in addition  after an operating facility affected by a casualty or condemnation is restored  there could be no assurance that customers who in the interim choose to use alternative disposal services would return to use the company s services

in order to establish consistent profitability  the company must achieve the following maintain its collection fees at levels sufficient to recover an adequate portion of collection costs  increase gross margins to the extent of cost increases  maintain its distribution capability  maintain competitiveness in pricing  continue to manage its operating expenses  and limit any increases in its indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve these objectives or attain consistent profitability
