the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all yearly references are to our fiscal years ended june   and  unless otherwise indicated 
all tabular amounts are in thousands  except percentages 
overview we are a leading provider of software and services that deliver solutions to help companies streamline their business processes and improve workforce productivity through mobilizing corporate applications and data 
we also provide software and expertise that enables our mobile device manufacturer customers to accelerate their product development cycles and enhance the functionality of new products they bring to market 
the users of our products are enterprise employees that complete their jobs or portions of their jobs outside of the company owned facilities where they have traditionally accessed  viewed and updated information through wired networks 
also advancing the adoption of enterprise mobility solutions is the increased availability and capability of powerful mobile devices such as pda s  mobile phones and converged devices 
enterprises are increasingly realizing they can improve their competitiveness by mobilizing corporate information 
we believe a full understanding of our operating results for the year ended june   requires an understanding of how the mobility solutions markets are evolving and influenced the elements that drove our company performance 
although the mobility solutions market is still in the early phases of development  organizations are increasingly developing a mobile computing strategy as part of their plans to increase productivity  improve competitiveness and enhance customer relationships 
however  the slow growth recovery occurring in most global economies continues to restrain information technology spending and has caused enterprises to focus spending on mobile technology investments that can achieve a to month payback 
many companies launch their mobile strategy with a mobile contacts  calendar  task and e mail application 
our mobile solution that meets this need  onebridge mobile groupware comprises the majority of our enterprise mobility software revenues and revenue from this product was a significant element of our growth in fiscal device manufacturers are also evolving their products to address this growing enterprise mobility market 
notebooks  mobile phones and standard pdas have been the dominant mobile infrastructure devices 
however  as mobile device designers and marketers have launched campaigns to communicate the added value of smart phones and converge devices  adoption rates for these devices have increased 
to address the growth in this market  the rapid products development cycles  and the demand for a robust feature set  device manufacturers have increasingly turned to third parties to provide the technology for short range wireless connectivity products 
our device manufacturer solutions revenue grew in fiscal as additional handset manufacturers selected our technologies and the handset models that included our technology were introduced successfully into the marketplace 
we believe europe has been the global leader in the deployment of wireless infrastructure 
the coverage and data capacity of wireless networks developed more rapidly in europe than in other global markets and the market for mobility solutions has grown in europe 
we have a long operating history in europe with offices in four countries and have gained both market awareness and developed long standing customer relationships 
a significant portion of our revenue and revenue growth was derived from both european customers purchasing our enterprise mobility solutions and european device manufacturers introducing successful converged devices that contained our device manufacturer products 
in  we introduced our first enterprise database products 
we continue to market and sell these products to application developers and enterprises to support the data requirements of both mobile and traditional enterprise applications 
these products grew in fiscal as the applications utilizing our database were marketed successfully to companies in europe and north america 
application developers that purchase our enterprise database products have required a solution that is stable and mature 
we also have developed an extensive network of resellers that market these products globally 
as these products do not require heavy research and development investment or significant sales and marketing support  they have been an important source of positive cash flow to our company 
in fiscal we will continue to focus on revenue growth by generating more sales of our solutions to enterprise customers and mobile device manufacturers 
we believe enterprise customers will move toward purchasing mobile applications that can have an immediate financial impact such as field service  supply chain and logistics  healthcare  field sales and government and education 
enterprises will choose vendors with knowledge of workflows and business process and those that can provide a business case for investment 
we expect to compete directly with both larger companies that have significant resources and experience and smaller companies that focus on a particular mobile vertical 
we also expect to experience longer sales cycles  which is typical for sales of larger  mission critical business applications 
our operating expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal by million 
however million of the higher spending was the result of higher restructuring charges and higher costs associated with defending ourselves in a patent infringement case 
without these expenditures  our operating expenses increased million  while revenues increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the factors we outlined above 
despite the revenue growth and control of expense increases  we continued to experience losses from operations and net losses per share 
in response to these conditions  we realigned our management and sales organization to support the strategic direction of the company 
we restructured many of our operations and sales territories in an effort to improve organizational efficiencies  controlled our expense structure  and took initiatives to increase sales productivity and drive a more profitable long term financial model 
we expect to continue many of these activities over the next several quarters  and doing so may put pressure on our financial results and operations as we continue to position the company to participate in the growth of the mobile solutions market 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a material impact on our net revenue  operating income and net income loss  as well as on the value of certain assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
the policies described below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain our significant accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements are highlighted below 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded  however  certain judgments must be made by management in interpreting the rules and in applying our revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly 
to recognize software revenue we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  and recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable  based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if payment terms are extended for a significant portion of the fee or there is a risk that the customer will expect a concession  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due and payable 
if we had assessed the fixed or determinable criterion differently  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
at the time of the transaction we also assess whether or not collection is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer recognition of the fee as revenue  and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
if we assessed collectability differently  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for instance  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method 
this means that we defer revenue from the total fees associated with the arrangement equivalent to the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements of the arrangement that have not yet been delivered 
the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of an undelivered element is generally established by using historical evidence specific to extended systems 
for example  the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance and support is based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon the renewal rates quoted in the contracts  and the fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
if we allocated the respective fair values of the elements differently  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
for certain of our products  we do not sell maintenance separately but do provide minimal support  patches  bug fixes and other modifications to ensure that the products comply with their warranty provisions 
accordingly  we allow for warranty costs at the time the product revenue is recognized 
when we license our software to original equipment manufacturers or to companies that include our software in their software offering  royalty revenue is recognized when customers report to us the sale of software to their end user customer 
in cases where the arrangement with our customer provides for a prepaid nonrefundable royalty  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exits  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue for support and maintenance services ratably over the contract term  which is usually months  and we generally recognize revenue from training services as these services are performed 
for professional services that involve significant implementation  customization  or modification of our software that is essential to the functionality of the software  we generally recognize both the service and related software license revenue over the period of the engagement  using the percentage of completion method 
in cases where our professional services involve customizations for which the amount of customization effort cannot be reasonably estimated  where significant uncertainty about the project completion exists  or where an arrangement provides for customer acceptance  we defer the contract revenue under the completed contract method of accounting until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved or the contract is complete 
if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates of the total amount of work we expect to be required to complete an engagement  the timing of our revenue recognition from period to period  as well as the related margins  might differ materially from that previously reported 
business combinations and acquired intangible assets we account for our purchases of acquired companies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and account for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as developed technologies  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development costs ipr d  if any  are immediately expensed in the period the acquisition is completed 
identifiable intangible assets are currently amortized over a weighted average of one to three years using the straight line method 
the majority of entities we acquire do not have significant tangible assets and  as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of intangible assets  potential charges related to ipr d for future acquisitions  and potential impairment charges related to goodwill 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually  during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or more frequently if events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and we then compare the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  fixed assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in accordance with sfas no 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a market capitalization approach when the information is readily available 
when the information is not readily available  we use a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model to measure any impairment 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates our measurement of any impairment may have differed materially from that reported 
income taxes on a quarterly basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
as of june  we had recorded a valuation allowance against percent of our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
this valuation allowance was recorded based on our estimates of future us and foreign jurisdiction taxable income and our judgments regarding the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount or timing of the valuation allowance recorded may have differed materially from that reported 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to reduce the valuation allowance  potentially resulting in an income tax benefit in the period of reduction  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  we record a specific allowance based on the amount that we believe will not be collected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  we record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the timing and amount of our reserve may have differed materially from that reported 
restructuring we report costs associated with employee terminations and other exit activity in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  and sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we record employee termination benefits as an operating expense when the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employee and no significant future services are required 
we recognize facility lease termination obligations  net of estimated sublease income  and other exit costs when we have future payment with no future economic benefit or a commitment to pay the termination costs of a prior commitment 
these termination and other exit costs are reported at fair value 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from their functional currencies  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses  or cumulative translation adjustments  which are included as a separate part of our net equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive loss 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the computation method and treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures is considered the functional currency  but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations is also considered 
cumulative translation adjustments include any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements when the functional currency of any subsidiary is the local currency 
however  if the functional currency were deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the remeasurement of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized and recorded within our statement of operations in the period during which the disposal occurs 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly  during the years ended june   and  translation adjustments of thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively  were recorded as additions to our accumulated other comprehensive loss 
at june  and  cumulative translation losses of approximately million and million were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss  within our balance sheet 
these translation losses have accumulated since we formed our first foreign subsidiary in had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the united states dollar  we would have computed a remeasurement gain or loss using a different method and such gain or loss would have been included in our results of operations for each of the years presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar and the significance of the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
these currencies include the euro  the british pound sterling and canadian dollar 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time or we sell or liquidate one of our subsidiaries  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations 
legal contingencies from time to time we may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims 
periodically  but not less than quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
due to the uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and claims and may revise our estimates 
such revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth the selected consolidated financial data for the periods indicated  expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
for the years ended june  revenue license fees and royalties services and other total net revenue costs and expenses cost of license fees and royalties cost of services and other amortization of purchased technology research and development acquired in process research and development 
marketing and sales general and administrative restructuring charges patent litigation fees  license and settlement non cash stock compensation amortization of goodwill total costs and expenses loss from operations other income expense  net gain on sale of land interest expense loss before income taxes income tax benefit provision loss from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax income loss from discontinued operations net loss comparison of fiscal years ended june   and revenue the following table presents our license  support and maintenance  and professional services revenue for the years ended june   and  and the percentage changes from the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  change change revenue license fees and royalties    support and maintenance    professional services and other   total net revenue    we sell our adaptive mobility products to enterprises  original equipment manufacturers  application developers  distributors and valued added resellers 
no customers accounted for greater than of revenue from continuing operations in fiscal  or license fees and royalties 
the majority of our product license revenues consist of fees related to products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis 
product license fees can be associated with a customer s licensing of a given software product for the first time or with a customer s purchase of the right to run a previously licensed product on additional computing capacity or by additional users 
our royalty revenue consists of fees related to our oem customers periodically increasing the number of units they are authorized to use of a licensed software product and are normally paid on a quarterly basis 
we classify our product offerings into one operating segment  our adaptive mobility segment  which consists of products and services that extend enterprise applications to mobile and wireless environments 
the products in our adaptive mobility segment include enterprise mobility solutions  mobile device solutions and enterprise database solutions 
the table below presents total net license fees and royalty revenue by product line and its percentage of total revenue for the years ended june   and for the fiscal year ended june  of total of total of total license fees and royalties enterprise mobility solutions    change from prior year mobile device solutions    change from prior year enterprise database solutions    change from prior year total net revenue    license revenue from our enterprise mobility products increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal we sell our enterprise mobility products to corporate customers either directly through our field sales staff or through distributors  valued added resellers and other channel partners 
the increase in enterprise mobility product license revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the successful introduction of our new ip based push enabled onebridge products in early these new products enhanced functionality that was of particular interest to our customers that purchase our mobile pim and email application  onebridge mobile groupware 
sales growth resulted from both sales of our onebridge mobile groupware to new customers and our existing customers deploying the products to more users during the year 
we believe these customers also purchased onebridge mobile groupware because of its competitive total cost of ownership combined with the onebridge product platform s design which enables customers to roll out future mobile applications such as mobile field service and mobile sales force automation applications on the same devices that receive email 
license revenue from our enterprise mobility products increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal included in this increase was thousand of additional revenue from adding the onebridge presentation server and mobile business solutions products to our product mix as a result of the viafone acquisiton during fiscal license and royalty revenue from our mobile device products increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal we sell our mobile device products either directly or through distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers that supply the mobile handset and the telematics industries 
as handset manufacturers have increased the capability of these devices to communicate with other devices or synchronize data with personal computers  the demand for our products that enable this functionality has grown 
during fiscal  we experienced both new design wins with oem manufacturers that licensed our products and saw existing customers increase shipments of handsets that include our products 
the increase in mobile device product license revenue of thousand in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to design wins and the resulting royalties paid for our xtndconnect pc products by mobile handset manufacturers 
royalty revenue generated from sales to original equipment manufacturers has fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past 
we expect it will also fluctuate in future quarters  because demand in these markets is difficult to predict  as it is dependent upon the timing of customer projects and the effectiveness of their marketing efforts 
additionally  fluctuations can occur due to the nature of the arrangements with customers  which can vary between quarterly royalty payments that become due as devices are shipped by the manufacturer to initial one time payments that allow the customer either unlimited or a capped number of licenses 
license revenue from our enterprise database product lines increased thousand in fiscal as compared to fiscal as the applications developed and sold by the value added resellers using our database technology gained wider acceptance in the marketplace 
we sell our database products to enterprise customers and software developers who write applications utilizing our product s data management capabilities 
additionally in the second half of fiscal  we offered significant incentives and discounts for quantity based purchases to our customers that resulted in higher license revenues 
the increase of thousand in enterprise database product license revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the addition of value added resellers purchasing new licenses and the applications developed and marketed using our database technology gaining wider acceptance 
we expect revenue from license fees and royalties to increase in fiscal as we introduce new products and enhance the functionality of our existing products 
we also anticipate our installed customer base for our onebridge mobile groupware  particularly in europe  to purchase additional licenses as they roll products out to additional users 
also  during fiscal many of our customers and potential customers investigated the cost and benefits of implementing mobile applications beyond email  and we expect our revenues to grow as these customers purchase new or additional licenses of our onebridge mobile platform middleware to enable these applications 
support and maintenance 
support and maintenance revenues are derived dominantly from our enterprise mobility products and represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll products in our software maintenance and support programs 
enrollment in these programs generally entitles customers to product enhancements  technical support services and ongoing updates for compatibility with new mobile devices and mobile device operating systems 
these fees are generally charged annually and for software products sold directly to enterprises have been in the range of to of the discounted price of the product 
for software products sold through resellers that provide support directly to their customers this range has been to 
software sold to oem customers generally does not include support or maintenance agreements  as all technical issues are resolved before the sales transaction is completed 
support and maintenance revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was the result of customers who had previously purchased our onebridge products continuing support and maintenance combined with the ratable recognition of revenue from new support and maintenance contracts sold to customers purchasing our products for the first time in fiscal additionally  several resellers who had not previously purchased support and maintenance contracts elected to purchase these programs during fiscal in fiscal  revenue from support and maintenance increased from fiscal the increased revenue resulted from both sales of support and maintenance contracts to both new and existing customers 
our support and maintenance revenue depends on both our software license revenue and renewals of maintenance agreements by our existing customers 
our maintenance revenue has increased on a year over year basis in each of fiscal   and  as a result of both new licenses and support and maintenance renewals 
we expect that our support and maintenance revenue will increase or decrease as our license revenue increases or decreases 
professional services 
professional services revenue is derived primarily from our work related to enterprise mobility products and consists of fees for consulting  product installations  training  and developing custom applications that utilize our middleware products such as onebridge mobile data suite 
professional services revenue in fiscal did not change significantly from the revenue we reported in fiscal the primary driver for our professional services revenue was our customers purchasing services to aid them in developing software solutions for their mobile workforce 
these services consisted primarily of work to develop  test and deploy custom mobile applications for field service  sales force automation and mobile consumer applications in both europe and north america 
the increase in service revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal was a result of adding a dedicated professional services group to our solutions offerings in the first quarter of fiscal in connection with the viafone acquisition 
the majority of our professional services for fiscal related to significant customization of our software products to operate in specific customer environments or for inclusion in handset products by our oem customers 
we expect service revenue to increase in fiscal  as more customers will purchase services to develop custom applications 
although we expect an overall increase in the amount of billable hours of our professional services group  service revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the amount of revenue we may be required to defer under our revenue recognition policy and the timing of services engagements 
international revenue we derive a significant amount of our revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states  principally from our european based sales force and channel partners  overseas original equipment manufacturers and from a number of international distributors 
based on the region in which the customer resides  the table below presents total net revenue by region and its percentage of total net revenues for the years ended june   and for the fiscal year ended june  of total of total of total north america    change from prior year europe    change from prior year asia pacific and rest of world    change from prior year total net revenue    sales to domestic customers declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal by million and as a percentage of the total dollars 
the decline was primarily a result of more european based customers purchasing professional services in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal a dominant portion of the professional services revenue was performed for north american customers  however in fiscal  of the professional services revenue was performed for customers in europe 
sales in north america grew million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this growth was primarily a result of both license revenue from the new onebridge presentation server and mobile business solutions products and the professional services revenue added as a result of the viafone acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal the amount and percentage of revenue from europe increased in both fiscal and fiscal as compared to the prior year as a result of several factors 
in fiscal  a major european handset manufacturer incorporated our desktop synchronization technology into a very successful mobile handset series and we received quarterly royalty payments from this customer in both fiscal and over the past several years we have made significant investments in our european based pre sales  sales  and technical support teams  and these investments have resulted in both obtaining new customers and increasing the amount of sales to existing customers 
we believe the adoption rate of mobile devices and wireless infrastructure in europe is more advanced than that in north america and we are benefiting from our significant presence in this market 
we have also developed an extensive network of resellers in europe that market our products  particularly our onebridge mobile groupware products  to a wide range of companies 
additionally  we have entered into relationships with several partners that have developed vertical applications utilizing our onebridge mobile platform that they resell to customers in europe 
additionally  the increase in revenue from our european customers was a result of the decrease in the strength of the us dollar as compared to the euro and british pound sterling  which resulted in sales to our european customers invoiced in local currencies being greater in us dollars than they would have been  had the exchange rate remained constant 
reported revenue from our european customers invoiced in local currency grew between fiscal and fiscal and between fiscal and fiscal  but had the exchange rate for the us dollar remained constant between those years  revenue would have grown only and  respectively 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenue in the foreseeable future 
our revenue from asia pacific and the rest of the world is primarily from our sales to oem customers of our mobile device manufacturer products 
we also sell our enterprise mobility products in this geography through distributors and value added resellers 
we sell our products in these regions in us dollars and do not have significant revenues derived from sales in foreign currencies from this region 
in fiscal revenue from the region increased thousand 
this increase reflects additional shipments to oem customers from asia pacific of our products for inclusion in handsets manufactured in the region 
cost of revenue the following table sets forth our costs of license fees and other royalties  technical support and professional services for the years ended june   and  and dollar and percentage changes from the prior year change change cost of licenses fees and royalties as a of license fees and royalty revenue cost of technical support services    as a of support and maintenance revenue cost of professional services and other    nm as a of professional services and other revenue total cost of revenue     percentage change not meaningful cost of license fees and royalties 
the cost of license and royalty revenue consists primarily of amortization of purchased technology and royalties for the use of third party software 
although license and royalty revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and in fiscal as compared to fiscal  there was no significant change in the cost of license fees and royalties due to the fixed cost nature of the amortization and licensing agreements we have arranged with third parties 
cost of technical support services 
the cost of technical support services consists primarily of compensation and benefits  third party contractor costs and related expenses incurred in providing customer support 
the increase in gross margin during fiscal and compared to prior years was due to an increase in support revenues resulting from new support and maintenance contracts and renewals of previous contracts 
we expect increases in our cost of technical support services as our service revenue grows to support the deployment of enterprise software solutions 
cost of professional services 
the cost of professional services consists primarily of compensation and benefits incurred in providing services for building custom applications  training  consulting  installations and assisting with customer deployments 
professional services gross margins were  and in the fiscal years ended june   and respectively 
in fiscal  we did not have a dedicated professional services group 
the revenue in fiscal was the result of charges paid by our mobile device solutions customers for inclusion of their customer driven specifications into the products 
these specific requests were incorporated into the product and completed as part of the normal product development process 
the corresponding costs to complete this work were not distinguishable from our ongoing research and development costs and were included as research and development costs in our fiscal results of operations 
we expect professional services revenue to grow in fiscal as more of our customers begin work on mobile applications projects 
however  given the high level of fixed costs associated with the professional services group  an inability to generate sufficient services revenue to absorb these fixed costs could lead to lower or negative gross margins 
we have also experienced fluctuations in our professional services revenue on a quarterly basis due to the timing of revenue recognition  which may be delayed due to specific contract terms 
we expect our professional services revenue will continue to experience these fluctuations in the future 
amortization of purchased technology the following table presents our amortization of purchased technology for the years ended june   and  and the percentage changes from the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  change change amortization of purchased technology as a of net revenue amortization decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the intangibles related to our acquisition of rand software becoming fully amortized in the second quarter of fiscal the net increase in fiscal compared to fiscal results from the addition of non goodwill intangibles in connection with our acquisition of viafone 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
 which resulted in thousand of intangible assets  comprised of assembled workforce intangibles  being reclassified as goodwill in the first quarter of fiscal we expect a decrease in amortization of other intangibles in fiscal as a result of a portion of our purchased technology becoming fully amortized in the first quarter of fiscal research and development expenses the following table presents our research and development expenses for the years ended june   and  and the percentage changes from the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  change change research and development    as a of net revenue research and development expenses consist of compensation and benefits for our software developers and development support personnel  including software programmers  testing and quality assurance personnel  product managers and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides 
these expenses also include consulting costs  facility and communications costs  costs for software development tools and equipment and  in the second half of fiscal  the cost of training our outsourced quality assurance service provider 
during the fiscal years presented above  all software development costs have been expensed 
research and development expenses were thousand less in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of reductions in personnel costs of thousand achieved through attrition and layoffs resulting from restructurings undertaken primarily in fiscal and completed in early the million decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was also primarily the result of a reduction in personnel and consulting costs subsequent to our restructurings 
research and development personnel decreased by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to fiscal the restructurings had an objective of reducing the overall research and development spending level while simultaneously increasing productivity 
the productivity improvements were based on a combination of improved processes  elimination of unnecessary function  and clear ownership and focus of product development initiatives between our separate development groups 
we were also able to reduce research and development costs in fiscal as a result of completing the fundamental development work for our onebridge mobile groupware and platform solution upon which the data synchronization and management product offerings are built 
we expect research and development costs to increase in fiscal as we add additional resources to complete our planned new products and enhanced functionality of our existing products 
we expect to incur these expenses through the recruiting and hiring of additional employees in our engineering departments in addition to retaining offshore resources  primarily in india  to assist with the technical support  quality assurance and development activities 
marketing and sales expenses the following table presents our marketing and sales expenses for the years ended june   and  and the percentage changes from the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  change change marketing and sales    as a of net revenue marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries for our sales  inside sales  marketing and technical sales staff  sales related commissions and bonuses paid to our direct sales force  commissions to third party distributors and other marketing related expenses including trade shows  promotional materials  public relations and advertising 
the increased spending in fiscal is primarily the result of thousand in increased sales salaries and a thousand increase in sales commissions 
these higher costs were the result of retaining more experienced sales leadership and increasing the experience level of the people who are accountable for the sales of our enterprise mobility solutions 
additionally  we incurred thousand of increased travel and entertainment costs for our sales and marketing organization 
commissions to third parties increased by thousand during fiscal as compared to fiscal as these distributors increased the amount of mobile device solutions they sold to our oem odm customers 
the increases discussed above were partially offset by a thousand decrease in our marketing expenses achieved both through a reduction in personnel and by reducing our participation in trade show and other marketing programs 
the increase in marketing and sales expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of approximately million  offset in part by a decrease in promotional expenses of approximately thousand 
we expect marketing and sales expenses to increase in fiscal as a result of an expected increase in revenue  although we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of net revenue 
we expect that the increase in marketing and sales expenses in fiscal will be primarily attributable to increased sales compensation 
general and administrative expenses the following table presents our general and administrative expenses for the years ended june   and  and the percentage changes from the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  change change general and administrative    as a of net revenue general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and other personnel costs for our executive management  finance and accounting  management information systems  human resources and other administrative groups

fiscal amounts also include an expense recorded in the first fiscal quarter of thousand of legal and other professional services costs related to failed acquisition activities and the reversal in the first quarter of thousand of accrued professional services costs related to the failed merger with palm  inc in the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately thousand in personnel costs resulting from our restructurings and a decrease in bad debt expense of approximately thousand 
restructuring charges the following table presents our restructuring charges for the years ended june   and  and the percentage changes from the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  change change restructuring charges  as a of net revenue we recorded million in workforce reduction costs during fiscal the restructuring charges consist of thousand of severance  benefits  and other costs related to the resignation of steven simpson  our former president and chief executive officer  and thousand of severance  benefits and other costs related to the resignation of karla rosa  our former chief financial officer

as of june  we had paid thousand of these charges 
the remaining balance of thousand was paid in the first two quarters of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal we also assumed a restructuring liability in connection with our acquisition of viafone 
prior to our acquisition of the company  viafone had implemented a restructuring program that resulted in charges for workforce reduction costs  costs related to closing its office in france and excess facilities costs related to lease commitments for space no longer used in brisbane  california 
at the time we completed the viafone acquisition  there were thousand of future lease commitments that had been accrued but not yet paid  thousand of workforce reduction liabilities and thousand of liabilities relating to the closure of viafone s french office 
as of june  the workforce reduction liabilities and liabilities related to closing viafone s french office had been paid in full  and the thousand balance of future lease commitments assumed was paid or reversed in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded approximately thousand in workforce reduction costs  consisting primarily of severance  benefits and other costs related to the termination of approximately employees in research and development  marketing and sales  and administration

all amounts due were paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal a summary of the restructuring costs payable is outlined as follows workforce facilities reduction and other costs costs total balance at june    restructuring charges incurred in fiscal cash payments   balance at june  restructuring charges incurred in fiscal restructuring accrual assumed with viafone acquisition   adjustment to the accrual assumed with viafone acquisition cash payments  balance at june  restructuring charges incurred in fiscal other adjustments a b cash payments  balance at june  a an adjustment was made to the accrual for workforce reduction costs to account for amounts paid to certain former employees who were paid amounts less than originally provided 
b as a result of the brisbane lease termination during the second quarter of fiscal  the balance of restructuring charges related to this lease as of october  was reversed 
patent litigation fees  license and settlement the following table presents our patent litigation  license and settlement expense for the years ended june   and  and the percentage changes from the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  change change patent litigation fees  license settlement   as a of net revenue in april  intellisync corporation filed a patent infringement action against the company in the us district court in northern california 
the action alleged that our xtndconnect server and desktop synchronization products infringed on seven of intellisync s synchronization related patents 
we incurred legal fees and other related costs in connection with defending this action 
on march  we mutually agreed with intellisync corporation intellisync  formerly known as pumatech  inc  to settle the patent infringement lawsuit 
both companies agreed to settle all claims and to immediately terminate litigation proceedings 
in connection with the settlement  we made a one time payment to intellisync of million and received a license to certain intellisync patents 
this payment covers estimated past and future royalties on revenue related to our products shipped and covered under intellisync s licensed patents 
both companies have agreed there will be no further patent litigation actions for a period of five years and that intellisync will release all of our customers from any claims of infringement relating to their purchase and future use of our products 
included in the expense above is million of the one time payment based on revenues related to our products covered by the license 
the remaining one time payment balance of thousand was capitalized and will be amortized over future years  based on sales of the related products 
non cash stock compensation the following table presents our non cash stock compensation expense for the years ended june   and  and the percentage changes from the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  change change non cash stock compensation nm nm as a of net revenue percentage change not meaningful during fiscal  we changed the compensation for the members of our board of directors to include annual grants of restricted stock 
additionally  we made restricted stock grants to certain of our employees in october these expenses reflect the charges related to the amortization of the related compensation expense over the period the stock vests 
in fiscal  we expect these charges to decrease as the grants to employees fully vest in the second quarter of fiscal however  the decrease will be offset somewhat by future amortization expense related to additional annual grants of restricted stock to be made to the members of our board of directors 
other income expense the following table presents our other income and expense for the years ended june   and  and the percentage changes from the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  change change foreign currency exchange gain loss interest income net rental income nm nm other net income expense nm nm percentage change not meaningful other income and expense consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the mark to market of intercompany amounts owed to us by our international subsidiaries  rental income generated from subleasing the excess space at our headquarters facility and interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
the change in foreign currency gain or loss from fiscal to and from fiscal to is primarily due to the gain we recognized in fiscal as a result of the decrease in the strength of the us dollar in the fourth quarter of fiscal at a time when we were not entering into foreign currency forward contracts 
we recognized foreign currency exchange losses in fiscal and primarily due to our intercompany balance forecasts differing from projections in periods of currency volatility 
for additional information on our foreign currency exposure see item a of this form k 
interest income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase of invested cash in fiscal generated by the sale and leaseback of our headquarters building and the sale of excess land 
interest income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decline of cash invested and a drop in short term interest rates 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began subleasing a portion of the unused space at our headquarters facility in boise  idaho 
the increase in net rental income from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to our subleasing space for all of fiscal in addition  the rent we received in fiscal was offset by the leasing commission we expensed when earned 
the amount of any foreign currency exchange gain or loss for fiscal will depend upon currency volatility  the amount of our intercompany balances and our ability to accurately predict such balances  and whether we decide to enter into foreign currency forward contracts in fiscal we expect interest income and net rental income to remain relatively constant 
gain on sale of land in the second quarter of fiscal we sold approximately acres of vacant land adjacent to our headquarters building in boise  idaho 
we received net cash proceeds of million after deducting fees related to the transaction 
interest expense the following table presents our interest expense for the years ended june   and  and the percentage changes from the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  change change interest expense as a of net revenue interest expense consists primarily of interest associated with the sale and leaseback of our headquarters land and building  which is accounted for as a financing transaction  interest paid on the term debt that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of viafone in august and warrant expense amortization related to entering into our line of credit agreement with silicon valley bank in january interest expense increased by approximately thousand in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of entering into the sale and leaseback agreement 
this increase was partially offset by a thousand decrease in interest expense in fiscal related to the cessation of the warrant expense amortization in fiscal interest expense increased to thousand in fiscal from thousand in fiscal primarily as a result of interest expense related to our assumption of million of term debt in connection with the viafone acquisition and as a result of fiscal including a full year of warrant amortization 
income tax provision benefit the following table presents our income tax provision or benefit for the years ended june   and  and the percentage changes from the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  change change income tax provision benefit 
 as a of income loss before taxes we recorded an income tax provision in fiscal consisting primarily of foreign withholding taxes for which no credit is currently available against us taxes due to our net loss position 
the change in the income tax provision benefit from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the tax benefit we recorded for continuing operations in fiscal that offset the foreign withholding taxes 
the income tax benefit decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of recording an income tax benefit of approximately million in the third quarter of fiscal for the refund we received as a result of the temporary increase in the net operating loss carryback period created by the job creation and worker assistance act of we expect to record an income tax provision of approximately thousand in fiscal related primarily to payments of foreign withholding taxes 
business combinations in august  we completed our acquisition of viafone 
for information on this acquisition see note business combinations in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report 
results of discontinued operations in fiscal years ended and we exited a historical business that no longer fits into the company s strategy for becoming the global leader in providing mobile solutions for the enterprise 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted a formal plan to exit our infrared hardware business as a result of an expected decline in sales of these products and our desire to increase our focus on our core software businesses 
throughout fiscal and the first half of fiscal  we continued to see revenue from this business as customers placed final orders 
all final orders were shipped before december  on june   we completed the sale of extended systems singapore pte ltd  our wholly owned singapore subsidiary  to brookhaven asia ltd  a holding company co owned by the existing management team of extended systems singapore pte ltd 
the purchase price for all the outstanding shares of the company was  we originally acquired extended systems singapore ltd  formerly parallax research ltd  in november the singapore operation was instrumental in driving our infrared hardware business  and in managing our relationships with third party contract manufacturers in asia 
as we have continued to focus our efforts on our mobile and wireless enterprise software solutions  revenue from our hardware products has been a declining percentage of our net revenue 
as a result  the singapore entity was no longer strategic to our business 
results for our infrared hardware business and singapore subsidiary operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods and are reported  net of tax  under income from discontinued operations on our statements of operations 
fiscal year ended june  change change net revenue   income from discontinued operations  net of tax gain loss on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax nm nm percentage change not meaningful revenue from discontinued operations for fiscal and consisted primarily of revenue from our discontinued infrared hardware business 
both net revenue and income from discontinued operations declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal because final orders were shipped in the first half of fiscal net revenue from discontinued operations decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of there being no revenue from our former singapore subsidiary and no material revenue from our discontinued printing solutions segment in fiscal income from discontinued operations increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in net income from our infrared hardware operations in fiscal  which was a result of minimizing expenses related to these operations 
additionally  in fiscal the singapore business generated a net loss 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition net cash used by operating activities fiscal year ended june  net cash used by operating activities    net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of our net loss  which was significantly impacted by the non recurring cash costs of approximately million related to the litigation and settlement of the alleged patent infringement lawsuit by intellisync corporation 
included in the net loss were non cash charges for depreciation of million  which declined from the prior year as assets became fully depreciated and were not replaced with new purchases 
non cash charges for stock compensation of million were also included and increased from the prior year primarily due to the amortization of the restricted stock grants made during the year plus the charges related to the termination of employees including the former ceo and cfo 
also included in our operating results was a non cash gain of million related to the sale of excess land adjacent to the corporate headquarters during the second quarter of fiscal accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by million during fiscal primarily due to the reduction in accrued restructuring costs and the reversal in the first quarter of thousand of accrued professional services costs related to the failed merger with palm  inc in net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of our net loss and the result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  adjusted for such non cash items as depreciation and amortization of million 
these cash uses were partially offset by acquired in process research and development of thousand 
net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of our net loss and the result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  adjusted for such non cash items as depreciation and amortization of million 
these cash uses were partially offset by a decrease in receivables and inventories of million  and an increase in deferred revenue of thousand 
accounts receivable  net of allowance  increased from million at june  to million at june  this increase in accounts receivable is due to an increase in total net revenue and an increase in dsos days sales outstanding 
our dso for the quarter ended june  was days as compared to days for the quarter ended june  the increase in dso is a result of more of our revenues originating from customers in europe and asia that have historically had longer payment terms than our north american customers 
we expect that our accounts receivable will increase in fiscal as a result of an expected increase in net revenues 
accounts receivable may also increase in the future if net revenue from international customers becomes a higher percentage of our net revenue 
net cash provided by investing activities fiscal year ended june  net cash provided by investing activities  net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was generated primarily from the sale of our excess land 
in the second quarter of fiscal we sold approximately acres of vacant land adjacent to our headquarters building in boise  idaho 
we received approximately million in net cash proceeds after deducting fees related to the transaction 
this cash inflow was offset by spending on property and equipment  which included spending of thousand for tenant improvements we were required to make to the subleased portion of the unused space at our headquarters building pursuant to the sublease agreements and thousand for software and other expenses related to a project to upgrade our accounting and transactional infrastructure 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of completing the acquisition of viafone 
as part of our continued effort to control cash and expenses  we did not make a significant investment in property and equipment in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of our singapore subsidiary net of cash sold with the entity 
these proceeds were partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of thousand 
as part of our effort to control cash and expenses  we also did not make a significant investment in property and equipment in fiscal we plan to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately thousand during fiscal  primarily for updating hardware and software infrastructure and real property repairs 
net cash provided by used by financing activities fiscal year ended june  net cash provided by used by financing activities  net cash provided from financing activities in fiscal resulted most significantly from the cash received in the sale and leaseback of our headquarters facility 
on september   we closed the sale and leaseback transaction and received proceeds of million  netting million after deducting transaction costs 
as part of the agreement  we entered into a year master lease for the building with annual payments equal to approximately thousand 
we also received cash from transactions related to our stock during fiscal we received million in net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options granted to employees and thousand from the purchase of stock by our employees through our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash used by financing in fiscal was primarily the result of thousand of payments made on term debt assumed as part of our acquisition of viafone  partially offset by thousand of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was the result of thousand in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
on january   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank and renewed and restructured this agreement effective as of august  under this agreement we can access up to million of financing in the form of a demand line of credit 
our borrowing capacity is limited to of eligible accounts receivable balances and is collateralized by certain of our assets 
interest on any borrowings will be paid at prime 
the line of credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and expires in august we are in compliance with all covenants 
there are no outstanding draws on this facility 
upon completion of our acquisition of viafone on august   we assumed million of term debt with silicon valley bank 
we have restructured that debt into a term loan due in equal monthly installments bearing interest at 
the term loan is collateralized by certain of our assets  requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and is scheduled to be paid in full by march we believe that our existing working capital  our borrowing capacity and the funds we expect to generate from our operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
we cannot be certain  however  that our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will be accurate 
if our operating results were to fail to meet our expectations or if accounts receivable  or other assets were to require a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated  we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity 
however if we were required to obtain additional financing to fund future operations  sources of capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
we intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of  or strategic investments in  companies with complementary products  technologies or distribution networks in order to broaden our adaptive mobility product offerings 
we currently have no commitments or agreements regarding any material transaction of this kind 
at some point in the future we may require additional funds for either operating or strategic purposes and may seek to raise additional funds 
these sources of liquidity could include raising funds through public or private debt financing  borrowing against our line of credit or offering additional equity securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  substantial dilution to our stockholders could result 
in the event additional funds are required  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our on going business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnership such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  or spe s  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited proposes 
as of june   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
commitments and contractual obligations we currently lease office space at our locations in boise  idaho  herrenberg  germany  toronto  canada  corvallis  oregon  paris  france  bristol  england  san diego  california  american fork  utah  and s hertogenbosch  the netherlands 
we also lease certain equipment under non cancelable operating and capital leases 
lease expense under operating lease agreements was thousand  thousand and thousand for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
on september   we closed a transaction with hopkins financial services for the sale and leaseback of our headquarters building and land in boise  idaho 
because we have a year option to repurchase the building and land at a price of million and we sublet more than a small portion of the building space  the sale and leaseback was recorded as a financing transaction and is shown as million of long term debt on our balance sheet at june  as part of the agreement  we entered into a year master lease for the building with annual lease payments equal to of the sale price  or approximately thousand 
we are also obligated to pay all expenses associated with the building during our lease  including the costs of property taxes  insurance  operating expenses and repairs 
upon completion of our acquisition of viafone on august   we assumed million of term debt with silicon valley bank svb 
we restructured that debt into a term loan due in equal monthly installments bearing interest at 
the term loan is collateralized by certain of our assets  requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and is scheduled to be paid in full by march at june   the loan balance was thousand 
our minimum future contractual commitments associated with our operational indebtedness and lease obligations as of june  are as follows in thousands year ending june  thereafter total svb debt principal svb debt interest payment pursuant to building sale and leaseback   capital leases operating leases  post retirement benefits total commitments    this amount is reported on the balance sheet as a liability 
effects of foreign currency exchange rates we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from international sales  principally through our international subsidiaries and through a limited number of independent distributors and overseas original equipment manufacturers 
sales made by our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in each country s respective currency 
fluctuations in exchange rates could cause our results to fluctuate when we translate revenue and expenses denominated in other currencies into us dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates also may make our products more expensive to original equipment manufacturers and independent distributors who purchase our products in us dollars 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the canadian dollar  euro and british pound sterling  to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  these fluctuations are generally offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying asset or liability being managed  resulting in minimal net exposure for us 
these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and  as such  the contracts are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we report a net currency gain or loss based on changes in the fair value of forward contracts combined with changes in fair value of the underlying asset or liability being managed 
the success of these currency activities depends upon estimation of intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
when determining whether to enter into foreign currency forward contracts  we also consider the impact that the settlement of such forward contracts may have on our cash position 
to eliminate a potential cash settlement of a forward position we may  from time to time  decide not to use foreign currency forward contracts to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries 
in a period where we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts  we could experience significant non cash currency gains or losses if the value of the us dollar strengthens or weakens significantly in relation to the value of the foreign currencies 
as of june   we had forward contracts with a nominal value of million in place against the canadian dollar  euro and british pound sterling  which matured within days 
we had no forward contracts in place as of june  we recognized a net currency exchange loss of approximately thousand for the fiscal year ended june   a net currency exchange gain of approximately thousand for the fiscal year ended june  and a net currency exchange loss of approximately thousand for the fiscal year ended june  factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we have a recent history of losses and may continue to generate losses in fiscal since the third quarter of our fiscal  we have devoted significant financial resources to the research and development of  and marketing and sales for  our mobile information management software products and  as a result  we have generated operating losses 
we intend to continue to devote significant financial resources to product development and to marketing and sales activities 
our ability to reach break even from operations and our ability to reach profitability and positive cash flow from operations in subsequent periods  will depend on a number of factors  including o our ability to generate sufficient revenue and control expenses  o buying patterns of our enterprise  application developer and original equipment manufacturer customers  o changes in customer demand for our products  o the timing of customer orders  which can be influenced by fiscal year end buying patterns  seasonal trends or general economic conditions  o announcements or introductions of new products or services by our competitors  o delays in our development and introduction of new products and services  o changes in our pricing policies as a result of increased competition  o the mix of distribution channels through which we sell our products  o the market acceptance of our new and enhanced products and the products of our customers that are application developers and original equipment manufacturers  o the emergence of new technologies or industry standards  o normal seasonality that we typically experience in the first quarter of our fiscal year  and o a shift in the mix of professional services and licensing revenue  which may result in fluctuations in our gross margin 
we are advancing our enterprise mobility solutions product line  which currently derives its revenues primarily from personal information management and email applications  by increasing the emphasis on mobile applications  including line of business applications for field service  sales force automation and other custom applications 
if we are unable to complete this progression  our operating results could be harmed 
o changes in our partnering and go to market strategy 
to effectively compete in mobile line of business applications we need to partner with independent software vendors and system implementers that have knowledge of the specific industries and workflows for the targeted vertical applications 
one of our core capabilities is our knowledge of how mobile access to corporate information can impact and improve the productivity of mobile workers 
to achieve a successful partnering arrangement we must attract the business interests of these prospective partners and coordinate the efforts of our marketing  sales and professional services organizations 
these tasks are complicated and involve many people and processes 
if we fail to attract these partners or effectively co ordinate these efforts we will not be able to broaden the acceptance of our mobile middleware platform into other applications and would remain dependent on revenue from pim and email applications which we believe could be subject to price erosion in the marketplace 
o changes in the make up of our executive team 
we believe we have taken steps to strengthen our management team and have added people with the skills and experience to lead the company through the progression described above 
several members of our executive team  including our chief executive officer  our chief financial officer  our chief marketing officer  vice president of human resources and vice president of emea have joined the company within the last three to eighteen months 
as a result  the executive team has a relatively short history of working together  and we cannot be certain whether they will be able to manage the transition of the company 
if they are unable to work together effectively or do not execute the business plan efficiently  our business will suffer 
o changes in the sales organization 
we have many new sales representatives in our enterprise mobility products sales force that may take time to reach productivity 
late in fiscal and into fiscal we began to reorganize our sales force and replace the previous sales team with people that have more tenure and experience selling to large enterprises 
we also established a new focus on large strategic accounts  re allocated territories and terminated a number of representatives 
as a result of these changes many of our account representatives operated under new leadership  began working with new customers or were relatively new to our company 
we have a significant number of sales representatives that are working toward achieving acceptable productivity 
if the new members of our sales team are unable to become fully productive in a reasonable time frame or we are unable to retain these new sales representatives  we may lose sales opportunities and market share  take longer to close anticipated sales and experience a shortfall in revenues 
markets for our products are becoming increasingly competitive  which could result in lower prices for our products or a loss of market share 
we may not compete successfully against current or future competitors  some of whom have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  more employees and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations and distribution resources 
we expect increasing price pressure for several of our products including our mobile pim and email applications  irda and bluetooth products as these technologies become more commodity oriented and less differentiated in the marketplace 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins  loss of market share and a change in our business and marketing strategies  any of which could harm our business 
the competitive environment may require us to make changes in our products  pricing  licensing  services or marketing to maintain and extend the market acceptance of our products 
price concessions or the emergence of other pricing or distribution strategies by our competitors or us may diminish our revenue 
defects in our software products  including our newly released onebridge products  could result in a loss of revenues  decreased market acceptance  injury to our reputation and product liability claims 
the software products we offer  particularly our enterprise mobility software  are inherently complex 
significant technical challenges arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy our products across a wide variety of mobile device hardware types and operating systems  operate over various carrier networks and interface into a wide variety of enterprise scale applications and data configurations 
this risk increases when we release new products or make significant enhancements to our existing products or where we have limited experience with new or complex customer environments 
we have not experienced substantial  unresolved problems to date  however  customers have in the past and may in the future experience delays and difficulties when deploying our products into large  complex and variable environments 
product deployment issues can arise from a customer s configuration of their load balancing  clustering  authentication profiles or the data structures of their ibm notes or microsoft exchange systems and may require professional services to resolve these issues 
despite quality control processes and testing by our current and potential customers  and us we cannot be sure that errors will not be found in current versions  new products or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
we recently began shipping and customers have recently begun installing onebridge in the course of the customer implementation activities that we have been involved with to date  we have encountered what we believe to be ordinary errors of the type generally associated with a release of major software programs 
however  there can be no assurance that significant defects will not be detected as customers deploy the product in larger volumes into even more complex environments 
software errors  if significant  or market perception that our software is not fully ready for production use whether accurate or not could result in o failure to achieve market acceptance  o loss of customers  o loss or delay in revenues  o loss of market share  o diversion of development resources  o damage to our reputation  o increased service and warranty costs  and o claims or litigation for breach of contract or warranty 
our increasing focus on enterprise customers may lengthen our sales cycles and increase fluctuations in our financial results 
as we seek to license our software to large enterprises and increase the average value of each sales transaction through our varied channel approach  we have experienced sales cycles that can be substantially more lengthy and uncertain than sales to smaller organizations of less complex product offerings 
as we focus on large mobile application solutions that involve mission critical business applications  our enterprise customers generally require us to expend substantial time  effort and money in establishing the relationship and educating them about our solutions and how our solutions can provide benefits to their business 
also  sales to enterprise customers generally require an extensive sales effort throughout the customer s organization and often require final approval by the customer s chief information officer or other senior executive employee 
these factors substantially extend the sales cycle and increase the uncertainty of whether a sale will be made in any particular quarter  or at all 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience delays and uncertainty in our sales cycle as well as increased up front expenses in connection with our enterprise sales efforts 
the timing of the execution of the enterprise volume licenses or the length of the contract negotiation process could cause our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we may incur substantial costs to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of introduced new requirements applicable to us regarding corporate governance and financial reporting 
among many other requirements is the requirement under section of the act for management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and for our registered public accountant to attest to this report 
we expect to dedicate significant time and resources during fiscal to ensure compliance 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to comply with section failure to do so could result in penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements  which could affect the ability of our auditors to issue an unqualified report 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate and are difficult to predict 
the timing of large orders is more unpredictable 
our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and unpredictable revenue shortfalls could disproportionately and adversely affect operating results 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
as we increase our focus on sales to large enterprise and increase our sales through independent software vendors the lack of predictability of our sales cycle will increase 
the timing to close orders remains difficult to accurately predict as a result of the overall economic conditions  cautious capital spending by business and the complexities of selling to large enterprises 
in contrast  our expense levels are relatively fixed in the near term and based in part on our revenue expectations 
if revenue is below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust personnel and other expenditures to compensate for the shortfall on a rapid basis 
our stock price is volatile 
our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly and fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our stock price has been and is highly volatile 
our stock price is highly influenced by current expectations of our future revenues  earnings and cash flows from operations 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts  prospective investors or current shareholders  the price of our stock may fall 
in addition  quarter to quarter variations in our revenue and operating results could create uncertainty about the direction or progress of our business or create a negative change in our perceived long term growth prospects  which could result in a decline in the price of our stock 
other factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock include o announcements of acquisitions by us or our competitors  o changes in our management team  o our ability to obtain financing when needed  o sales of significant numbers of shares within a short period of time  o announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  o general conditions in the computer and mobile device industry  o general economic conditions and their impact on corporate information technology spending  o price and trading volume volatility in the public stock markets in general  o announcements and updates of our business outlook  and o changes in security analysts earnings estimates or recommendations regarding our competitors or our customers 
consolidation in our industry may impede our ability to compete effectively 
consolidation continues to occur among companies that compete in our markets as firms seek to offer more extensive suites of mobility software products and to take advantage of efficiencies and economies of scale 
in fiscal our competitors completed acquisitions including but not limited to the following examples  intellisync corporation acquired synchrologic  ianywhere  a division of sybase  inc acquired xcellenet  inc  broadcom acquired widcomm  inc 
and infowave incorporated acquired telispark 
changes resulting from these and other consolidations may harm our competitive position 
in addition as the trend toward consolidation continues  we may encounter increased competition for attractive acquisition targets and my have to pay higher prices for those businesses or technologies we seek to acquire 
the loss of key personnel  or our inability to attract and retain additional personnel  may harm our business 
our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced  qualified employees  particularly highly skilled software engineers  effective enterprise sales representatives and management personnel 
our plans include adding a number of new employees most significantly in our research and development group 
competition for qualified personnel in the computer software industry is growing as the software industry rebounds from the technology downturn experienced in the past several years 
we are not certain that our efforts to retain our key employees will succeed or that we will be successful in recruiting new qualified employees 
if we lose the services of one or more key employees  or if one or more of them decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  our business could be harmed 
searching for replacements for our key employees could divert management s time and result in increased operating expenses that may not be offset by either improved productivity or higher prices 
new employees generally require substantial training  which may require significant resources and management attention 
our business relies on enterprises implementing mobile applications and devices 
the market for these products is developing and may be harmed if customers are slow  or do not adopt our products or by declines in overall information technology spending 
the enterprise mobile application market is still developing and enterprises are exploring the benefits of mobilizing corporate information including their mission critical applications 
mobile contacts  calendar and email are becoming more generally accepted mobile applications  however  our customers and potential customers have not traditionally mobilized their other enterprise applications 
as this is a relatively new market  we cannot be certain that this market will develop and grow 
we expect that we will continue to need to pursue intensive marketing and selling efforts to educate prospective customers about the benefits to their operations through use of our products 
this could cause our sales and marketing expenses to increase without a corresponding increase in revenues 
the market for our products also depends on the broader economic climate and spending on information technology  including mobile applications and devices 
the global economic downturn and the slower growth in the geographies experiencing economic recovery may cause enterprises to delay implementation of mobile device and application rollouts  reduce their overall information technology budgets or reduce or cancel orders for our products 
our original equipment manufacturer customers may also limit development of new products that incorporate our products or reduce their level of purchases of our products in the face of slower information technology spending by their customers 
a general weakening of the global economy and weakening of business conditions  particularly in the information technology  telecommunications  financial services and manufacturing industry sectors  could result in potential customers experiencing declines in their revenue and operations 
in this environment  customers may experience financial difficulty or cease operations 
while we believe we have adequately factored these conditions into our current revenue forecasts  if these conditions worsen or continue longer than expected  demand for our products may be reduced as a result of enterprises reducing information technology spending on our products and original equipment manufacturers reducing their use of our products in their own products 
as a result  our revenue may fail to grow or could decline  which would harm our operating results 
if the current economic slowdown persists or worsens  we also may be forced to reduce our operating expenses  which could result in additional charges incurred in connection with restructuring or other cost cutting measures we may implement 
for example  in both fiscal and fiscal  we announced restructuring plans to replace or reduce personnel  reduce costs  and improve operating efficiencies and  as a result  incurred restructuring costs  primarily for severance payments to terminated employees 
we may not be able to successfully compete against current and potential competitors 
our markets are increasingly competitive and our competitors are some of the largest software providers in the world 
as the markets for adaptive mobility products grow  we expect competition from both existing and new competitors to intensify 
we compete with o mobile data management companies  including  ibm  ianywhere a division of sybase  infowave  jp mobile  microsoft  intellisync and rim o application mobilization companies  including everypath  ianywhere  microsoft  and oracle  o mobile enterprise solutions companies  including aether systems  dexterra  and infowave  o client server database providers  including interbase  microsoft  oracle and pervasive software  o mobile connectivity companies  including ivt corporation  agilent  embednet  csr  broadcom  telica  stonestreet one  link evolution and open interface  and o internal research and development departments of original equipment manufacturers  many of whom are our current customers 
to date  our solutions have been differentiated from our competitors based on total cost of ownership  interoperability  performance and reliability 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competition  particularly competitors that have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to respond more quickly than us to the new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
also  many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged to gain market share to our detriment 
these competitors may be able to undertake more extensive promotions activities  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  and offer more attractive terms to purchasers than we can 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationship among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products 
additionally  if existing or new competitors were to merge or form strategic alliances  our market share may be reduced or pressure may be put on us to reduce prices resulting in reduced revenue and margins 
these and other competitive factors could result in price reductions  reduced revenues and gross margins and lost market share and an inability to expand into new markets and industries  any one of which could materially affect our results of operations 
the success of our business may depend on us identifying and securing additional sources of financing  which sources may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms 
we believe that our existing working capital  the expected funds from the sale of our excess land  our borrowing capacity and the funds we expect to generate from our operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
we cannot be certain  however  that our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will be accurate 
if our operating results were to fail to meet our expectations or if accounts receivable  or other assets were to require a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated  we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity 
these sources of liquidity could include raising funds through public or private debt financing  borrowing against our line of credit or offering additional equity securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  substantial dilution to our stockholders could result 
in the event additional funds are required  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we depend on a number of key business relationships and if we fail to maintain these relationships  or are unable to develop new relationships  our business would suffer 
an important element of our strategy is the development of key business relationships with other companies that are involved in product development  joint marketing and the development of mobile communication protocols 
if we fail to maintain our current relationships or are unable to develop new relationships  our business would suffer 
some of these relationships impose substantial product support obligations on us  which may not be offset by significant revenue 
the benefits to us may not outweigh or justify our obligations in these relationships 
also  in order to meet our current or future obligations to original equipment manufacturers  we may be required to allocate additional internal resources to original equipment manufacturers product development projects  which may delay the completion dates of our other current product development projects 
our existing key business relationships do not  and any future key business relationships may not  provide us any exclusive rights 
many of the companies with which we have established and intend to establish key business relationships have multiple strategic relationships  and these companies may not regard their relationships with us as significant 
in most of these relationships  either party may terminate the relationship with little notice 
in addition  these companies may attempt to develop or acquire products that compete with our products 
they may do so on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
further  our existing business relationships may interfere with our ability to enter into other business relationships 
our investment in goodwill and intangibles resulting from our acquisitions could become impaired 
as of june   the amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles recorded on our books  net of accumulated amortization  was million 
we ceased amortizing goodwill upon our adoption of sfas no 
as of the beginning of fiscal  and we expect to amortize thousand of net identifiable intangibles in fiscal years through however  to the extent that our goodwill or other identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired because circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable  all or a portion of these assets may be subject to write off in the quarter of impairment 
such impairment and any resulting write off could have a negative impact on our results of operations in the period goodwill or other identifiable intangibles are written off 
we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by o rapidly changing technologies  o evolving industry standards  o frequent new product introductions  and o short product life cycles 
any delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  the inability of our products to achieve market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could harm our business 
the product development process involves a number of risks 
development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires us to manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns 
we may not be able to adequately protect our patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights from competitors  and we may be required to use a significant amount of our resources to defend ourselves from infringement claims made by others 
our patents  trademarks or copyrights may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  and the rights granted under these patents  trademarks and copyrights might not provide us with any competitive advantage  which could harm our business 
any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the claims we are seeking  if at all 
in addition  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around our patents 
further  effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some countries outside of the united states 
companies in the software industry resort to litigation over intellectual property rights and there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry regarding intellectual property rights 
during we settled an intellectual property dispute that required a significant amount of company resources 
it is possible in the future that third parties may claim that our current or potential future products infringe their intellectual property 
if a court finds that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third party  we could be subject to liabilities  which could harm our business 
as a result  we might be required to seek licenses from other companies or to refrain from using  manufacturing or selling specific products or using specific processes 
holders of patents and other intellectual property rights may not offer licenses to use their patents or other intellectual property rights on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all could harm our business 
in order to protect our proprietary rights  we may decide to sue third parties 
any litigation  whether brought by or against us  could cause us to incur significant expenses and could divert a large amount of management time and effort 
a claim by us against a third party could  in turn  cause a counterclaim by the third party against us  which could impair our intellectual property rights and harm our business 
our business may be harmed due to risks associated with international sales and operations  which represent a substantial portion of our revenue 
in fiscal  based on the region where the customer resides  over of our revenue was generated from international sales 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including o changes in regulatory requirements and resulting costs  o export license requirements  o export restrictions  tariffs  taxes and other trade barriers  o potentially reduced or less certain protection for intellectual property rights than is available under the laws of the united states  o longer collection and payment cycles than those in the united states  o difficulty in staffing and managing international operations  and o political and economic instability  including the threat or occurrence of military and terrorist actions and enhanced national security measures 
one or more of these risks could harm our future research operations and international sales and support 
if we are unable to manage these risks of doing business internationally  our results could suffer 
our business may be harmed if our professional services organization does not generate an acceptable profit level  incurs costs in excess of amounts billable to customers or if our professional service revenue increases as a percentage of total revenues 
our professional services business is subject to a variety of risks including o we may be unable to accurately predict staffing requirements and therefore the expense of fulfilling our service contracts may be greater than we anticipate  and o we may have an inappropriate level of resources dedicated to the professional services business in relation to the number of projects we are able to sell  resulting in a low utilization rate of resources 
o we may enter into professional services engagements that are complex and which are is difficult to estimate resource requirements and costs due to the nature and scope of the engagement and the need to integrate our work product with the products of other contractors retained by our customers  and o we have and may in the future enter into contractual arrangements with our professional services customers that subject us to damages and other liabilities if our work product does not conform to the agreed specification 
if we are unable to operate the professional services organization effectively  the profitability of this business could decline  or even result in a loss  which could harm our business 
in addition  we may enter into professional services projects that charge customers a fixed fee for a defined deliverable 
we have at times in the past underestimated and may in the future underestimate the amount of time or resources required to complete this work and receive customer acceptance 
if we do not correctly estimate the amount of time or resources required for a large project or a significant number of projects  our gross margins could decline  adversely impacting our operating results 
we realize lower margins on our professional service revenue than on license revenues 
as a result  if professional service revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue our gross margins may decline and our operating results may be adversely affected 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the transactions made through our subsidiaries in canada  france  germany  italy  the netherlands and the united kingdom are primarily denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  these international operations expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations  which in turn could cause our operating results to fluctuate when we translate revenue and expenses denominated in other currencies into us dollars 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the canadian dollar  euro  and british pound sterling  to manage currency fluctuations on payments and receipts of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries 
the success of these currency activities depends upon estimation of intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
when determining whether to enter into foreign currency forward contracts  we also consider the impact that the settlement of such forward contracts may have on our cash position 
to eliminate a potential cash settlement of a forward position we may  from time to time  decide not to use foreign currency forward contracts to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries 
in a period where we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts  we could experience significant non cash currency gains or losses if the value of the us dollar strengthens or weakens significantly in relation to the value of the foreign currencies 
if we account for employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans using the fair value method  it could significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share 
there has been ongoing public debate whether employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans shares should be treated as a compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
if we elected or were required to record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method  we could have significant accounting charges 
for example  in fiscal year  had we accounted for stock based compensation plans using the fair value method prescribed in fasb statement no 
as amended by statement  our net loss would have been increased by approximately million 
although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense using the fair value method in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value at the grant date and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan  it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all stock based compensation as an expense using the fair value method 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed presentation of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
if we are required to treat all stock based compensation as an expense  we may change both our cash and stock based compensation practices 
we depend on non exclusive licenses for some of the technology we use with our products 
we license technology on a non exclusive basis from several companies for use with our products and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
for example  we license encryption technology that we include in our onebridge mobile groupware products 
our inability to continue to license this technology  or to license other technology necessary for use with our products  could result in the loss of  or delays in the inclusion of  important features of our products or result in substantial increases in royalty payments that we would have to pay pursuant to alternative third party licenses  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  the effective implementation of our products depends upon the successful operation of licensed software in conjunction with our products 
any undetected errors in products resulting from this licensed software may prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products  delay new product introductions and injure our reputation 
some anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan  as well as provisions of delaware law  could impair a takeover attempt 
we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
these include provisions o dividing our board of directors into three classes  each serving a staggered three year term  o authorizing blank check preferred stock  which could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to its common stock  o dividend and other rights superior to its common stock  o limiting the liability of  and providing indemnification to  directors and officers  o requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors  o specifying that stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of shareowners 
these provisions  alone or together  could deter or delay hostile takeovers  proxy contests and changes in control or management of extended systems 
as a delaware corporation  we also are subject to provisions of delaware law  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 
in june  pursuant to a preferred stock rights agreement between extended systems and equiserve trust company  na  our board of directors issued certain preferred share purchase rights 
the rights were not intended to prevent a takeover of extended systems 
however  the rights may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of extended systems deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempted to acquire extended systems on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon redemption of the rights 
any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
we intend to pursue additional acquisitions  and any acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate with our business  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or adversely affect our operating results 
as part of our strategy  we intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of companies that either complement or expand our existing business 
if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions  our business would be harmed 
we may not be able to properly evaluate the technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction  including accounting charges and transaction expenses 
acquisitions involve a number of risks and difficulties  including o the integration of acquired technologies with our existing products and technologies  o diversion of management s attention and other resources to the assimilation of the operations and employees of the acquired companies  o availability of equity or debt financing on terms favorable to us and our stockholders  o integration of management information systems  employees  research and development  and marketing  sales and support operations  o expansion into new markets and business areas  o potential adverse short term effects on our operating results  and o retention of customers and employees post acquisition 
in addition  if we conduct acquisitions using debt or equity securities  our existing stockholders investments may be diluted  which could affect the market price of our stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our liquid investments are at fixed interest rates and  therefore  the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
all of our liquid investments mature within days or less of june   therefore  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of liquid investments is minimal 
sales made by our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the foreign country s currency 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the united states dollar and other currencies could materially harm our business 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the canadian dollar  euro  and british pound sterling  to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries  thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
we report a net currency gain or loss based on changes in the fair value of forward contracts combined with changes in fair value of the underlying asset or liability being managed 
the success of these currency activities depends upon estimation of intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
when determining whether to enter into foreign currency forward contracts  we also consider the impact that the settlement of such forward contracts may have on our cash position 
to eliminate a potential cash settlement of a forward position we may  from time to time  decide not to use foreign currency forward contracts to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries 
in a period where we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts  we could experience significant non cash currency gains or losses if the value of the us dollar strengthens or weakens significantly in relation to the value of the foreign currencies 
as of june   we had forward contracts with a nominal value of approximately million that matured within days in place against the canadian dollar  euro and british pound sterling 
we had no forward contracts in place as of june  we recognized a net currency exchange loss of approximately thousand for the fiscal year ended june   a net currency exchange gain of approximately thousand for the fiscal year ended june  and a net currency exchange loss of approximately thousand for the fiscal year ended june
