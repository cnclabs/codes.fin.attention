item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included at item overview lojack develops and markets the lojack system  a unique  patented system designed to assist law enforcement personnel in locating  tracking and recovering stolen vehicles 
the company also offers lojack early warning as an option to the lojack system which provides early notification to a vehicle owner in the event an unauthorized user is operating the vehicle 
the company s revenues in the united states are derived primarily from the sale of vehicle location units  alarms and related products  lojack early warning and extended warranties on its products  to consumers 
approximately of domestic sales are made through a distribution network consisting of dealers of new and used automobiles 
the company has strong consumer brand awareness in the united states and in many areas around the world 
the company derives an increasing percentage of its consolidated revenues from international licensees 
these revenues consist of product sales  royalties and license fees 
revenues from the international segment comprised approximately of consolidated revenues for the year ended december   up from in the prior year 
the company continues to expand its installation capacity and increase efficiencies by adopting alternative installation methods through contracting with certified dealers and other third parties to perform the installation of the vehicle location unit 
lojack monitors the quality of these alternative installations through the use of an expanded quality control process and maintains full warranty service of vehicle location units  both for the convenience of dealers through which the vehicle location units are marketed and for lojack to maintain a high degree of quality control and security over its technology 

table of contents lojack also offers an extended warranty at the point of sale to new customers and through direct sales efforts to existing customers 
the company records additions to deferred revenue for its lojack early warning product  international license fees  and certain warranty products for which the company has been deemed to be the primary obligor of the underlying contract 
the company receives full payment typically within days of the transaction  but recognition of the deferred revenue is spread over the estimated life of the product or service 
these payments are a significant component of the company s cash flow from operations 
additions for these components of deferred revenue were  for the year ended december   compared to additions of  for the same period a year ago 
key factors and areas of focus by senior management of the company include monitoring material trends of sales of the automotive industry with a focus on increasing penetration rates through the company s existing automobile dealer channel and markets  sharing the best practices among its international licensees and analyzing which have been successful  the effectiveness of strategic relationships with distributors  insurance companies and original equipment manufacturers  and the success of different pricing models such as those that include recurring payments  continuing reductions to domestic and international installed product costs  transitioning from a fixed to variable domestic installation cost structure by increasing the percentage of vehicle location units installed by third parties and continuing to develop improved technology and products while adding a second supplier 
the company evaluates its financial condition and operating performance based on the progress in achieving the strategic factors listed above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lojack and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation 
management is required  in certain instances  to use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein at item a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the significant accounting policies and estimates  which the company believes to be the most critical in understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial position and results of operations  include revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
the company earns revenues primarily from the domestic sale and installation of vehicle location units and lojack early warning  the sale of products and components to international licensees  the receipt of international license fees and royalties  and the sale of extended and enhanced warranty programs 
the company generally recognizes revenue on domestic sales of vehicle location units and most related products upon installation 
for sales to the company s third party sale and installation partners  revenue is recognized upon sale to the third party  not upon installation in the consumer s vehicle 
beginning in the first quarter of  the company began to certify certain automotive dealers and distributors to install vehicle location units  as a part of various programs intended to improve the cost effectiveness and efficiency in selling and installing vehicle location units 
the company s use of third party installers increased throughout and is expected to continue to increase during when the program was introduced  revenue recognition on sales to third party installers was deferred until the units were sold to the end customer because the related agreements with the installers contained a right of return 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began to recognize revenues relating to shipments to its third party installers upon shipment while establishing a related return allowance based on historical incidence of returns 
since the company began using third party installers  product returns from the third party installers have been nominal 
the company does not expect the incidence of returns to materially change in the future 
if the frequency of returns were to materially increase  the return allowance would need to be revised and reported revenues could be adversely impacted 
revenues relating to the sale of lojack early warning  a product launched in the northeastern united states in the fourth quarter of and nationally in the beginning of  are recognized over the period of the estimated life of vehicle ownership  which third party market research indicates is approximately five years 
as of december  and  the company has deferred recognition of revenue of approximately  and  respectively for this product 
if the estimated life of vehicle ownership proves to vary materially from the estimates used by the company  the company would be required to change its estimates  which could result in material differences in the amount of revenue recognized in any given period 
historically  there have not been any changes to management s five year estimate 

table of contents revenues from international license fees are recognized ratably over the initial term of the license  typically ten years 
revenues from the sales of products and components of the lojack system to international licensees are recognized upon shipment to the licensee or  if later  when payment becomes reasonably assured 
royalty revenues are recognized when earned or when payment becomes reasonably assured  whichever is later 
management makes estimates of collectibility based upon historical experience  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
historically  there have not been material adjustments to recognized revenues based on these estimates 
as of december  and  the company deferred revenue recognition of approximately  and  respectively  in product shipments to international licensees 
revenue on these shipments is recognized as payment becomes reasonably assured 
changes in the credit worthiness of these licensees could have a material effect on the timing and amounts of revenue recognized 
the company sells several types of contractual extended warranty products 
effective january   for those warranty products to which a third party  and not the company  is the primary obligor  the company recognizes payments for these insurance contracts  net of related costs  in revenues at the time of sale 
revenues related to extended warranties  for which a third party is the primary obligor  aggregated approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
if the laws of jurisdictions change so that the company is determined to be the primary obligor  revenues may have to be deferred under such circumstances 
management believes that these jurisdictional changes are possible and should they occur  reported revenues could be initially adversely impacted 
for those warranty products for which the company is the primary obligor  revenues are deferred and recognized over the estimated term of the warranties  determined to be equivalent to the estimated life of vehicle ownership  which is five years 
such revenues recognized from extended warranties previously deferred aggregated approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
if the estimated life of vehicle ownership varies significantly from the estimates used by the company  material differences in the amount of revenue recognized in any given period could result 
incremental costs directly related to the provision of such warranties are deferred and charged to expense proportionately as the revenues are recognized 
any remaining warranty costs relating to actual claims made are recognized when incurred 
management believes the likelihood of material changes to the average estimated life of vehicle ownership is low 
accounts receivable 
domestic accounts receivable are due principally from automobile dealers that are geographically dispersed 
if the creditworthiness or the financial strength of the dealers were to decline  there could be an adverse effect on the company s operating results and cash flows 
the terms under which the company generally sells products and components of the lojack system to international licensees include cash prepayments  letters of credit  purchased private trade credit insurance or  most commonly  established payment terms 
should geopolitical situations change in the countries where the company s international licensees operate  there could be additional credit risks 
as of december    or of net accounts receivable  was due from international licensees 
management makes estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable based upon historical experience  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
changes to these estimates are possible and could result in a material effect on reported results of operations 
product development 
costs for product development are expensed as incurred and include salaries  fees to consultants  and other related costs associated with the development of new products 
product development expenses were   and  for the years ended december  and and the ten months ended december   respectively 
substantial portions of the company s product development efforts have been outsourced to unrelated third parties 
the contracts with third parties require payments based upon completion of defined milestones 
because the rate of achievement of these defined milestones is unpredictable  the company s recorded product development expenses may vary significantly from period to period 
such variability can have a significant impact on income from operations and cash flows 
expenses related to milestone achievements amounted to   and  for the years ended december  and and the ten months ended december   respectively 
future expected attainment of existing milestones  by the company s two vendors supporting various products currently in development  could result in expenses of approximately  within the next twelve to eighteen months 
valuation of cost investments 
periodically  the company has made investments in its international licensees in the form of cash and or by converting receivables into equity 
as of december   investments in international licensees  totalling  included a equity interest  with a carrying value of  in the company s mexican licensee and a equity interest  with a carrying value of  in its french licensee 
the company s investments in these licensees have resulted in ownership of less than of any one licensee  resulting in accounting for these investments using the cost method of accounting 
under the cost method of accounting  investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  distributions of earnings and additional investments made 
the carrying values of these investments are periodically reviewed 
based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows  market conditions  legal factors  market potential  operational performance  and in some cases  independent appraisals  management has concluded that there are no impairments to the fair value of these investments that should be viewed as other than temporary 

table of contents the international licensees in which the company has made investments are in the early stages of operations and are in the process of developing their business models 
the company may be required to record an impairment charge in a future period if a licensee requires additional capital and is unable to raise sufficient capital to continue operations  a licensee raises sufficient capital  but at a lower stock price than currently valued and or the operations and future cash flows of the licensee vary significantly from current projections  adversely affecting the viability of the business 
the company has not recorded any gains or losses on these investments through december  while management believes that its estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in operating in these international markets could materially affect the company s evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of these investments 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements included herein at item results of operations recent trends many companies in the vehicle security market have stated that they offer stolen vehicle recovery solutions while automobile manufacturers are installing gps products  such as onstar  at the factory 
these factors have not had a material adverse impact on the company s revenues  unit sales or penetration rates thus far 
the long term impacts of these trends are hard to predict  however  lojack plans to implement additional complementary technology combining gps and or cellular based communications with lojack s time tested rf based stolen vehicle recovery technology 
the company is deriving an increasing percentage of its revenues from its international operations  increasing from of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  to of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  the company expects the trend of increasing revenues and profits generated by its international operations as a percentage of consolidated results to continue in the percentage of domestic units installed by third parties increased significantly during the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier  decreasing average direct installation labor cost per unit due to productivity improvements and the shift of expenses from fixed to variable 
the company expects that the percentage of business through third party installers and distributors will increase during and will result in a continued positive impact on revenue and earnings 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increased by  or  as compared to the same period a year ago 
for the year ended december   domestic revenues increased by  or  as compared to the same period a year ago  primarily due to an increase of  or  in revenue resulting  in part  from a increase in the number of vehicle location units sold during the period and an increase in the average revenue per unit sold reflecting a price increase that was implemented in the fourth quarter of also  during the fourth quarter of  the company began to recognize revenues relating to vehicle location units sold to third party installers upon shipment while establishing a related return allowance based on historical incidence of returns 
prior to the fourth quarter of  revenue on sales to the third party installers was deferred until the units were sold to the end customer because the related agreements with the installers contained a right of return 
this change resulted in the recognition of approximately  of revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of  which would have been deferred 
as of december    of revenue relating to this business was deferred  an increase of  or  in revenue recognized from the sale of warranty products 
the company sells contractual extended warranty products and recognizes revenues ratably over the term of the contract 
the company also sells a warranty product for which a third party  and not the company  is the primary obligor on the contract at the time of sale 
in most jurisdictions  the company recognizes payments for these contracts  net of related costs  in revenues at the time of sale 
there were significantly more jurisdictions in which a third party was the primary obligor during the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier  additional revenue of  related to lojack early warning which was launched in the northeastern united states in the fourth quarter of and nationally in the first quarter of  and 
table of contents a decrease in revenues of  from other automobile security products as emphasis shifted from these products to the aforementioned warranty products and the lojack early warning product 
for the year ended december   international revenues increased by  or  as compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to an increase in revenue of  or  resulting from a increase in the number of vehicle location units sold  an increase of  or  in license fee revenue recognized resulting primarily from  of revenue recognized in the third quarter of due to the termination of contracts with certain licensees and the resolution of certain contingencies resulting in accelerated recognition of previously deferred license fee revenue  increased royalty revenues of  or  resulting from payments received from the company s licensees in argentina and france as the pricing structures to these licensees were modified in late to include recurring payments  and a reduction of  in component sales to the company s licensees used for infrastructure in connection with their startup  in  the company s french and mexican licensees made considerable purchases while in only the company s licensee in spain began operations 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was of revenues compared to of revenues for the same period a year ago 
domestic cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was of revenues compared to of revenues for the same period a year ago  reflecting continuing initiatives to reduce the overall installed cost of the product  including various distribution and installation programs to more cost effectively sell and install vehicle location units by utilizing third parties 
the company expects that the percentage of business conducted through third party installers and distributors will increase during  and will result in a continued positive impact on reducing cost of goods sold 
international cost of goods sold for the year ended december  decreased to of revenues  from of revenues for the same period a year ago 
this decrease is largely due to the additional license fee revenue recorded in as discussed above which had no related cost of goods sold 
this decrease was partially offset by a higher proportion of sales to licensees in to countries that generate greater volume  which typically results in lower margins  and a shift for certain licensees to a pricing model that yields lower margins to lojack on the initial shipment of the product  but yields a recurring stream of revenue in the future 
product development expense increased by  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier 
the increase was mainly attributable to additional personnel costs and increased office rental expenses of  as the company increased its engineering capability to support new products and infrastructure equipment  attainment of previously defined milestones by the company s third party vendor resulting in the expensing of  in  only  of similar expenses were incurred in   of expenses to establish local manufacturing of the company s products in brazil  and product development costs of  expensed in the second quarter of as the project related to these costs was abandoned 
the company anticipates product development expenses to increase in over those amounts incurred in future expected attainment of existing engineering milestones by the company s unrelated development vendors could result in expenses of approximately  within the next twelve to eighteen months 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier  primarily due to reduced media and advertising spending of  in the first quarter of  as compared to  as the company reduced spending due to the then current downtrend in new vehicle sales  lower bad debt expenses of  as payment for certain substantial international receivable balances that were reserved for at december  were either collected or became reasonably assured of collection during  and reductions in spending of  on test marketing and market research programs in  as compared to in  the company explored the viability of the retail and domestic insurance distribution channels 

table of contents in  the company expects to maintain its reduced levels of spending on test marketing and market research programs and increase its advertising spending as advertising has a proven history of results for lojack 
the company expects total sales and marketing expenses to only moderately increase in as compared to general and administrative expenses increased by  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier primarily due to increased compensation related expenses of  which included incentive compensation expense as a result of improved company performance over the prior year  increased computer equipment rental expenses of  and increased travel expenses of  reduced legal fees of  as the fee arrangement with the company s lead outside counsel was renegotiated and fewer engagements were incurred with the company s international legal consultants  lower consulting fees of  due to the fact that professional fees incurred in the prior year relating primarily to the establishment of international markets and alternative domestic distribution partners which did not recur in  and reduced office related expenses of  as the company continued to focus on cost control initiatives during other income  net increased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year earlier primarily because of reduced interest expense recorded in connection with capital leases of the company s installation vehicles 
the provision for income taxes increased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year ago 
the increase was a result of  in additional related taxable income for as compared to the company s effective federal and state tax rate was for both periods 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  year ended december  vs 
year ended december  in october  the company announced that it had changed its fiscal year end from the end of february to december  effective december  the consolidated financial statements reflect the balance sheets as of december  and december  and the related statements of income  stockholders equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended december  and and the ten months ended december  unaudited financial information for the comparable twelve month period ended december  is presented in the table below and includes any adjustments consisting of normal  recurring adjustments  which are  in the opinion of management  necessary for a fair presentation 
for purposes of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company believes that these statements and comparisons provide a more meaningful analysis

the increase in domestic revenues reflected vehicle location unit volume increases of for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase in unit sales  which management believes was primarily attributable to the company s investments in marketing  advertising and sales initiatives  was partially offset by  in higher volume pricing discounts earned by larger customers in as compared to the same period in in addition  revenues from sales of other automobile security products increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  in the same period in the increase in international revenues was primarily the result of an increase of approximately  in sales of the international version of the vehicle location unit and related products and components primarily to france  puerto rico and mexico  as those markets continued to expand 
these increases were partially offset by reduced product sales of  to the company s south african licensee for the year ended december   due to lower demand from that licensee in  which rebounded in to levels similar to those of as of december   the company deferred revenues of  from shipments to certain licensees 

table of contents cost of goods sold for the year ended december   remained at as compared to the same period in domestically  cost of goods sold was of related revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the same period a year earlier 
this increase was primarily due to a decrease in average revenue per unit partially offset by increased efficiencies in the overall installed cost of the product 
international cost of goods sold decreased to of related revenues for the year ended december   from a year earlier 
the decrease in international cost of goods sold was primarily due to favorable volume variable pricing and other vendor rebates  as well as lower inventory write offs than in product development expense decreased by  to  for the year ended december  from  in the same period in development milestone payments to third parties were  in compared to  in  resulting in a decrease of  additionally   of costs relating to beta test units received in was expensed in there were no similar expenses for the year ended december  these decreases were partially offset by additional testing component costs and equipment depreciation of  and additional personnel costs of  incurred in the year ended december   as compared to the same period in as the company continued to prepare for future growth

the increase also includes additional expenses necessary to support future growth including  of rent  telephone and related overhead costs and  of staffing costs 
the increases were partially offset by reduced severance and retirement charges recorded in  was recorded in related to a management reorganization 
other expense  net was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in the change was mainly due to lower interest income of  in due to lower interest rates and lower cash balances available for investment and a reduction of interest expense of  in due to lower interest rates related to capitalized vehicle leases entered into during the year 
the provision for income taxes decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period in as the result of the decrease of  in related taxable income partially offset by an increase in the company s effective tax rate from in the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily a result of an increase in expenses that are non deductible for federal income tax purposes 
as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased by  to  during the year ended december  from  for the same twelve month period in liquidity and capital resources the company has returned to generating significant cash flows from its operations and expects this trend of increasing cash flows to continue in both the short and long term future 
additional uses of cash will be based on rate of return analyses  but may include investments in new technologies  products and or international licensees or markets 
making investments in international licensee operations and or new markets may require substantial investments of capital 
in  the company plans to continue to explore opportunities in its international markets  including the potential for strategic partnerships  alliances and or equity investments 
additionally  the company will continue to develop next generations of its vehicle location unit and may introduce new products that leverage its brand recognition and reputation for vehicle recovery 
efforts relating to the development of the next generation vehicle location unit with its unrelated third party vendors could result in expenditures for product development activities totaling  in the next twelve to eighteen months  depending on milestone attainment by the vendors 
the company intends on using cash to repurchase the number of shares of the 
table of contents company s common stock equivalent to the number of shares issued under its employee stock purchase plan  and may elect to repurchase shares of the company s common stock equivalent to the number of shares underlying stock options exercised 
the company plans to fund its operations  including capital expenditures  using existing cash  cash flows from operations and  if needed  the existing line of credit discussed below 
there are no material commitments for future capital expenditures for  however  the company expects that capital expenditures in may be as much as million 
the company finances its capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operations 
this liquidity is contingent on continued customer demand for its products and services  and continuing the existing relationships with international licensees and certain law enforcement agencies 
the company expects to continue these relationships 
the company believes that it will be able to keep pace with required technological changes in its products and expects that its sales and marketing initiatives will continue to drive customer demand 
the company s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table in thousands year ended december  cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities increased during the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to increased net income in of  a net increase in cash generated by deferred revenue of  offset by a net decrease in cash generated from the change in working capital accounts of  the decrease in cash generated from working capital is mainly attributable to changes in accounts payable due to the normal variations in the timing of vendor payments  offset by receipt of a  vendor volume rebate in  a  advance made to a licensee in the fourth quarter of  and a  increase in accrued and other liabilities during reflecting additional incentive compensation expense as a result of improved company performance over the prior year 
cash used in investing activities increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased capital expenditures incurred for maintaining and improving computer systems and the purchase of additional lojack system infrastructure components  mainly vehicle tracking units

table of contents working capital  cash flows from operations and  if necessary  drawing upon the company s line of credit facility  which expires in june the unsecured line of credit provides for maximum borrowings up to  outstanding borrowings under this line of credit facility bear annual interest  payable monthly  at the bank s base rate at december   or if converted  based upon the libor rate plus basis points totaling at december  
no borrowings under this facility were outstanding as of december  a  irrevocable letter of credit was established for a vendor in january and this letter of credit reduces the available borrowings under the line of credit facility 
the line of credit facility generally contains limitations on indebtedness  certain investments in equity securities and entity acquisitions  requires lender s approval of mergers  and prohibits disposition of assets other than in the normal course of business 
additionally  the company is required to maintain certain financial performance measures including debt service coverage  a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and a minimum current ratio 
the payment of dividends and repurchase of the company s common stock is permitted under the line of credit facility and is limited only to the extent such payments affect the company s ability to meet certain financial performance measures thereunder 
failure to maintain compliance with covenants could impair the availability of the facility 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the line of credit facility 
currently  the company does not enter into financial instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
the company does not intend to establish any special purpose entity and does not have any material off balance sheet financing transactions 
the company has substantial fixed contractual obligations under various capital and operating lease agreements relating to its office locations  computer and office equipment  tower infrastructure locations and vehicles used by installation personnel 
other substantial contractual obligations include severance arrangements  non cancelable inventory purchase commitments and engineering agreements if project milestones are met 
management believes the attainment of the project milestones over the next months is reasonably possible and estimable and  as such  these estimated milestones have been included in the table below 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments existing at december  were as follows payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years capital lease obligations including interest operating leases severance arrangements purchase commitments and milestone payments total other information cautionary statements the private securities litigation reform act of contains certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information  which involves risk and uncertainty 
any statements in this report and accompanying materials that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements including  but not limited to  statements concerning the characteristics and growth of the company s market and customers  the company s objectives and plans for future operations and products and the company s expected liquidity and capital resources 
such forward looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  and accordingly  actual results could differ materially 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to the company depends on its principal products and market acceptance of them 
the company currently derives most of its revenues from sales of vehicle location units and related products and the licensing of the lojack system and sale of related products to licensees in international countries 
the company also derives a portion of its revenues from sales of conventional vehicle security devices and the sale of warranties 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of the company s principal products would have an adverse effect on the company 

table of contents the company s success is heavily dependent upon acceptance of its current and future products in new markets 
there is no assurance that the lojack system and improvements and modifications thereto will continue to achieve widespread consumer acceptance in all of the company s existing or future markets 
the company is affected by changes in economic conditions and new vehicle sales 
the company s products are installed principally in new and used vehicles 
while the increase in the sale of its vehicle recovery system was substantially greater than the increase in the sale of new vehicles in  any change in general economic conditions resulting in decreased new vehicle sales could adversely affect the company 
because new car sales are most often a discretionary activity  the company is unable to accurately predict its sales in future quarters 
in any quarter  many factors can affect the company s revenues 
these factors include  but are not limited to  periods of economic slowdown  slowdowns in vehicle production  the effectiveness of the company s marketing initiatives  labor disputes affecting the automobile industry and any change in general economic conditions 
if significantly fewer new vehicles are sold  fewer vehicle location units may be sold and installed 
the company relies on key personnel 
the company s success depends  to a significant degree  upon the efforts and abilities of key technical  marketing  sales and management personnel 
the loss of services of one or more of these key employees could have an adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company believes that its future success depends in part upon its ability to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the company is subject to government regulations and approval 
the company must obtain the approval of law enforcement agencies  as well as other governmental agencies  for implementation of the lojack system before sales of vehicle location units can commence in a given jurisdiction 
the approval process may be time consuming and costly 
in addition  governmental approval may be terminable by the executive or legislative body in some jurisdictions 
such governmental discretion and regulation may limit the number of potential customers for the company s services or impede its ability to offer competitive services to the market 
the company s licensees will likely encounter similar or additional regulatory requirements and uncertainties as the company expands into international markets through its licensees 
lastly  the lojack system is operated by law enforcement agencies utilizing a frequency assigned by the fcc for that purpose 
the system operation is dependent on the continued availability of the frequency 
the company depends on proprietary technology 
the company s success is dependent on its proprietary technology 
although the company seeks to protect its intellectual rights through patents  trademarks  trade secrets and license agreements  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technology from misappropriation or that competitors will not develop similar technology independently 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert that the company s products infringe upon their own patents or trade secrets 
in addition  the laws of certain international countries in which the company s products are or may be distributed do not protect the company s products and intellectual rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the company currently depends on a single supplier for its principal product 
key components of the company s principal product are currently manufactured to the company s specifications by a single supplier 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with plextek limited  communications technology consultants  to design and supply  through a third party contract manufacturer  a next generation vehicle location unit 
lojack believes this will reduce risks associated with having only a single supplier and expects it will result in more competitive pricing 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain such components from its alternative supplier 
the company faces competition 
several competitors or potential competitors are marketing or have announced the development of stolen vehicle tracking products  which may be directly competitive with the lojack system 
to the company s knowledge  competitors have not developed stolen vehicle recovery products compatible with the lojack system
