item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive summary about the company schering plough is a worldwide pharmaceutical company committed to discovering  developing  manufacturing and marketing new therapies and treatments to enhance human health 
the company s primary business strategy is to continually discover or license human pharmaceutical products that are patent protected for an extended period of time 
when a product s patent expires  generic competition occurs  resulting in a substantial decline in a product s average selling price 
schering plough also has leading consumer product brands in the over the counter otc  foot care and sun care markets and has a global animal health business 
government regulatory agencies throughout the world regulate the company s discovery  development  manufacturing and marketing efforts 
the food and drug administration in the united states fda is a pivotal regulator of the company s business 
in the united states  the pricing of the company s pharmaceutical products is subject to competitive pressure as managed care organizations seek price discounts 
also in the united states  the company is required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in medicaid  the veterans health care program and other government funded programs 
in most international markets  the company operates in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs 
the company ships its pharmaceutical products to wholesalers and distributors  but markets these products to health care professionals  managed care organizations and  to a lesser extent  patients themselves 
key performance indicators kpis for the company are the percentage market shares for its products 
market shares for the company s major products are discussed in the sections that follow 
the current state of the company during the past three years  the company experienced a confluence of negative events  which are summarized as follows since  the company has been working with the fda to resolve issues involving the company s compliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp at certain of its manufacturing sites in new jersey and puerto rico 
in  the company reached a formal agreement with the fda for a consent decree 
under the terms of the consent decree  the company agreed to make payments totaling million and to revalidate the manufacturing processes at these sites 
these manufacturing sites have remained opened throughout this period  however  the consent 
table of contents decree has placed significant additional controls on production and release of products from these sites  including review and third party certification of production variances  and  for some products  review and third party certification of batch production records 
the third party certifications and other cgmp improvement projects have resulted in higher costs as well as reduced output at these facilities 
in addition  the company has found it necessary to discontinue certain older products 
the impact of the consent decree is discussed in more detail in the sections that follow 
certain of the company s sales and marketing practices are under investigation by the us attorney s offices in pennsylvania and massachusetts 
these investigations pose significant risks to the company and have caused the company to significantly increase its litigation reserves 
these matters are discussed in further detail in the sections that follow 
in december  the company switched all formulations of claritin in the united states from prescription to otc status 
this switch followed the loss of marketing exclusivity for the product 
the average unit selling price for an otc product is much lower than the price in the prescription market 
further  with the loss of marketing exclusivity  the company faces additional competition from comparable brands and generics in the otc marketplace 
claritin in the united states had been the company s leading product in terms of sales  and even more so in terms of profit 
as a result  the company has experienced a rapid  sharp and material decline in earnings and cash flow beginning in the company does not expect earnings to recover from the loss of sales of claritin until such time as the company introduces new products 
recovery may take several years 
the company s other leading franchise is the combination of pegylated interferon peg intron and ribavirin rebetol to treat hepatitis c 
in late  a competitor entered the hepatitis c marketplace with its own versions of pegylated interferon and ribavirin 
prior to the introduction of these competing products  the company held a leading position in the hepatitis c market 
with the introduction of this competitor  the company s market shares have fallen significantly 
this decline in sales has exacerbated the overall earnings and cash flow decline 
in addition  generic forms of rebetol may be approved at any time in the important us market 
if this were to occur  the company s market shares and sales would decline further 

table of contents the above matters have resulted in the following cash flow has declined significantly  particularly in the united states  where the majority of research is conducted and from where dividends are paid 
also  payments arising from the investigations being conducted by the us attorney s offices could further reduce cash flow in the united states 
in addition  the company s credit ratings have been reduced 
the impact of the lower credit ratings and the company s overall liquidity is discussed in detail in the sections that follow 
the company s manufacturing sites operate well below optimum levels due to sales declines and the reduction in output related to the consent decree 
at the same time  overall costs of operating the manufacturing sites have increased due to the consent decree activities 
the impact of these facts is a reduction in profit margins 
at this time  the major investments in manufacturing capacity are not impaired  however  the company continues to review the carrying value of these assets for indications of impairment 
future events and decisions may lead to asset impairment losses and accelerated depreciation due to shortened asset lives 
in response to the above  the company has initiated the following actions a new management team has been appointed and has implemented many changes  some of which are described in the following sections 
the quarterly dividend has been reduced to cents from cents per common share 
a program entitled value enhancement initiative vei has commenced 
vei is a tool designed to enable the company to save and spend wisely 
the key cost cutting initiatives implemented include eliminating most employee bonuses for under the company s standard plans 
eliminating the payout under the company s profit sharing plan 
eliminating routine merit increases throughout  with exceptions only where local contracts or practices prevent this action  for customer contact employees  for employees dedicated to fulfillment of the company s fda consent decree obligations and other business critical employees 
targeting an overall reduction in payroll and related expenses of at least percent  again excluding payroll expense associated with customer contact employees and employees dedicated to fulfilling the company s fda consent decree obligations 
the first step toward achieving this target was a voluntary early retirement program verp in the united states 
approximately employees elected to retire under this program 
installing global procurement programs 
exercising tight controls over new hires  cutting back in travel costs and reducing meeting expenses 

table of contents on a positive side  the company is entering the cholesterol reduction market with the launch of zetia ezetimibe and the us marketing application for ezetimibe simvastatin combination  which was submitted for filing in september the cholesterol reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical market in the world 
management believes that these products have the potential of enabling the company to move beyond the loss of claritin and to build long term financial strength 
in addition  the company believes that it has several potentially valuable pharmaceutical compounds in its earlier stage research pipeline 
the company is also aggressively pursuing licensing opportunities with other research based pharmaceutical companies 
outlook year over year comparisons between and will be negatively impacted by a number of factors  including the following the company experienced downward slopes in sales and market share of several of its key profit generating products throughout much of the company is making significant investments in sales and marketing support aimed at stabilizing market shares of its key profit generating products 
the company expects generic competition for rebetol in the us market to begin in the contraction of the worldwide hepatitis c market that began in may continue in the absence of losec revenues from europe due to the end of the agreement with astrazeneca in the third quarter of losec revenues were million in the ability of the company to rebuild its financial strength is highly dependent upon the success of the cholesterol joint venture with merck co  inc merck 
if this joint venture is highly successful  then the company may be able to rebuild its financial strength and turn around its operating performance beginning in if the joint venture is not highly successful  then the company must rely on the success of its early stage pipeline drugs  licensing opportunities  a significant change in corporate strategy or some combination of these 
the reader should note that there is significant uncertainty inherent in any of the factors that could enable the company to rebuild its financial strength

cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in increased over  primarily due to a change in product sales mix resulting from the loss of us sales of prescription claritin 
the increase was also the result of higher unit manufacturing costs  including the effect of lower production volumes  coupled with increased spending for the company s cgmp compliance efforts 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in increased over  primarily due to a shift in sales towards products on which royalties are paid and higher costs associated with manufacturing issues 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased percent to billion in versus billion in the decrease was mostly due to lower marketing expenses in the global pharmaceutical business  including zero payout of profit sharing and routine bonuses

table of contents liquidity and financial resources background the following background information may be useful to the reader in understanding the current state of the company s liquidity and financial resources 
at december   approximately percent of all cash and cash equivalents and short term investments shown in the accompanying balance sheet was held by wholly owned  foreign based subsidiaries 
at the same time  substantially all of the debt shown in the accompanying balance sheet was owed by the parent company or wholly owned  us based subsidiaries 
in years prior to  this geographic disparity between the location of the funds and the location of debt was not a pivotal issue for the company 
however  with the material decline in earnings following the loss of marketing exclusivity of claritin in the united states  this geographic disparity has taken on more importance 
cash and cash equivalents  plus short term investments  exceeded total debt at december  by billion 
however  using the funds held by the foreign based subsidiaries for the cash needs of the us based subsidiaries may result in us income tax payments 
the amount of any us income tax payments would depend upon a number of factors  including the amount of the funds used and whether the us operations were generating taxable profits or losses 
in  the us operations generated tax losses  primarily due to the decline of claritin sales and the continued investment in research and development 
for  the entire amount of the us tax losses will be used to recoup taxes paid in previous years carryback benefit 
in  management expects the us operations to again generate tax losses 
however  only a portion of these losses is expected to be used to recoup taxes paid in previous years because  under current law  the carryback benefit will be exhausted 
the amount of the expected loss in excess of that used to recoup taxes paid in previous years becomes available to reduce taxable income in the future carryforward benefit 
when the us operations generate losses that cannot be used to recoup taxes paid in previous years  the company has a choice 
it can either use the carryforward benefits in future years  or utilize some or all of those losses to absorb taxable distributions to the us of cash or other assets held by the foreign based subsidiaries 
absorbing the us operating losses in this manner allows a portion of the assets held by the foreign based subsidiaries to become available for use in the us operations without having to make us income tax payments 
as discussed below  the company expects to finance a portion of its cash needs in and possibly beyond by accessing some of the funds held by the foreign based subsidiaries 
the funds that the company expects to access represent foreign earnings to be generated in and beyond 
the company does not expect to incur additional us income taxes when accessing these funds because these taxable distributions will be absorbed by the expected us operating 
table of contents losses 
further  as described below  the company may make additional taxable distributions of funds held by the foreign based subsidiaries to the us operations because the company has triggered the credit rating downgrade provisions in certain of its financing arrangements 
the company may incur additional us income taxes because these additional distributions from the foreign based subsidiaries may exceed the us operating losses 
discussion of cash flow cash provided by operating activities totaled million in   million in and  million in cash provided by operating activities declined in due to lower sales of claritin  lower sales of the products within the intron franchise and higher manufacturing costs 
a portion of the cash flow impact of lower sales was mitigated by the collection of accounts receivable that followed the decline in sales 
cash provided by operating activities in also includes the second payment of million relating to the fda consent decree 
in previous filings  the company had reported that  for and possibly beyond  cash provided by operating activities would not be sufficient to fund working capital  capital expenditures and dividends  if these items remained at the then current levels 
in response to the decline in sales and earnings in as well as the likelihood of further declines in  the company announced on august   a reduction in the quarterly dividend from cents to cents per common share 
this action saves approximately million per quarter beginning with the fourth quarter of on that same day  the company also announced accelerated and intensified cost cutting actions  including a global workforce reduction effort 
as shown in the statements of consolidated cash flows for  cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and dividends exceeded cash from operations 
this excess of cash needs over cash generation occurred entirely within the us operations where the deficit was approximately  million 
foreign operations generated cash in excess of cash needs 
in  the company borrowed additional funds in the united states to finance the us operations while continuing to accumulate cash with the foreign based subsidiaries 
in  management expects its foreign operations to generate cash and its us operations to have cash needs 
however  excluding any potential payments arising from the litigation and investigations discussed below  the us deficit in is expected to decline 
for  dividend payments will be approximately million less than in  and the company expects to receive a tax refund in excess of million for the carryback benefit described above 
approximately million of cash was available in the us at december  to pay down commercial paper balances or fund the us operations 
the above discussion does not take into consideration any payments that may arise from the matters described in the legal  environmental and regulatory matters footnote included in the financial statements to this report 
in particular  the company has accrued material amounts with respect to the investigations being conducted by the us attorney s offices in pennsylvania and 
table of contents massachusetts and with respect to the dispute with the irs 
at this time  management cannot estimate the ultimate amounts or timing of such potential payments with certainty 
any such payments would increase the cash needs of the us operations and may necessitate additional financing  repatriation of funds held by foreign based subsidiaries or a combination of the two 
these matters may also affect the company s credit ratings and its ability to access commercial paper 
if the company s current cash management strategy and capital structure remain unchanged beyond  management expects both the cash held by the foreign based subsidiaries and the debt owed by the us based subsidiaries to increase 
management is in the process of evaluating whether the present strategies and structure are the most appropriate in light of the increasing debt levels as well as the changing portfolio of the company s products 
management believes the company possesses sufficient financial resources to meet all of its financial needs 
the company has in excess of billion in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  albeit held by foreign based subsidiaries  as well as sizable lines of credit with commercial banks  as described below 
further  management believes the company has continuing access to the capital markets 
borrowings and credit facilities on november   the company issued billion aggregate principal amount of percent senior unsecured notes due and billion aggregate principal amount of percent senior unsecured notes due proceeds from this offering of billion are being used for general corporate purposes  including to repay commercial paper outstanding in the united states 
upon issuance  the notes were rated a by moody s investors service moody s and a on creditwatch with negative implications by standard poor s s p 
the interest rates payable on the notes are subject to adjustment 
if the rating assigned to the notes by either moody s or s p is downgraded below a or a  respectively  the interest rate payable on that series of notes will increase 
see the financial instruments and commitments footnote included in the financial statements to this report for additional information 
the company has three revolving credit facilities totaling billion 
the most recently negotiated facility september is a billion  day credit facility from three major financial institutions that can be drawn down in the united states 
this facility matures in september the other facilities are with a syndicate of financial institutions and provide for million that can be drawn down in the united states through may with repayment due may  and a second multi currency facility for million that can be drawn down in the united states and internationally through the maturity date in may at december   no funds were drawn under any of these facilities 
at december   short term borrowings totaled  million 
approximately percent of this was outstanding commercial paper 
the commercial paper ratings discussed below have not significantly affected the company s ability to issue or roll over its outstanding commercial paper borrowings at this time 
however  the ability of commercial paper issuers  such as the 
table of contents company  with one or more short term credit ratings of p from moody s  a from s p and or f from fitch ratings fitch to issue or roll over outstanding commercial paper can  at times  be less than that of companies with higher short term credit ratings 
in addition  the total amount of commercial paper capacity available to such issuers is typically less than that of higher rated companies 
the company maintains sizable lines of credit with commercial banks  as well as cash and short term investments held by foreign based subsidiaries  to serve as alternative sources of liquidity and to support its commercial paper program 
credit ratings on december   s p lowered the company s corporate credit and long term debt ratings to a from a and said the outlook on the ratings was negative  noting a weakening in the company s intron franchise and expected declines in earnings and cash flows 
there was no change in the company s short term corporate credit and commercial paper rating  which was lowered to a from a on july  on january   s p placed the company s corporate credit rating  short term credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating on creditwatch with negative implications 
on february   s p downgraded the company s senior unsecured debt ratings to a from a 
at the same time  s p also lowered the company s short term corporate credit and commercial paper rating to a from a s p removed the company from creditwatch  however  its outlook remains negative 
on october   moody s lowered the company s corporate credit rating to a from a and lowered its commercial paper rating to p from p following this rating action  moody s removed the company from its watchlist and revised its rating outlook to stable from negative 
moody s also stated that its credit rating assumed modest outflows to settle outstanding litigation or acquisitions and that a very large payment associated with litigation proceedings or acquisition activity could place pressure on the rating and or outlook 
on november   fitch downgraded the company s senior unsecured and bank loan ratings to a from a  and its commercial paper rating to f from f the company s rating outlook remained negative 
in announcing the downgrade  fitch noted that the sales decline in the company s leading product franchise  the intron franchise  was greater than anticipated  and that it was concerned that total company growth is reliant on the performance of two key growth drivers  zetia and remicade  in the near term 

table of contents financial arrangements containing credit rating downgrade triggers the company has two separate arrangements that enable it to manage cash flows between its us subsidiaries and its foreign based subsidiaries 
both of these arrangements employ interest rate swaps  and both of these arrangements have similar credit rating downgrade triggers which allow the counterparty to call for early termination 
the credit rating downgrade triggers require the company to maintain a long term debt rating of at least a by moody s or a by s p 
both s p s and moody s current credit ratings are below this specified minimum 
as a result  the counterparty to the interest rate swaps can elect early termination following a specified period  as described below 
one of the arrangements utilizes two long term interest rate swap contracts  one between a foreign based subsidiary and a bank and the other between a us subsidiary and the same bank 
the two contracts have equal and offsetting terms and are covered by a master netting arrangement 
the contract involving the foreign based subsidiary permits the subsidiary to prepay a portion of its future obligation to the bank  and the contract involving the us subsidiary permits the bank to prepay a portion of its future obligation to the us subsidiary 
interest is paid on the prepaid balances by both parties at market rates 
prepayments totaling billion have been made under both contracts as of december  the prepaid amounts have been netted in the preparation of the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts 
this arrangement provides that in the event the company fails to maintain the required minimum credit ratings  the counterparty may terminate the transaction by designating an early termination date not earlier than months following the date of such notice to terminate 
however  if such notice is given  the early termination consequences discussed below would occur at the end of the three year period 
early termination requires repayment of all prepaid amounts  and repayment must occur in the original tax jurisdiction in which the prepaid amounts were made 
accordingly  early termination would require the company s us subsidiary to repay billion to the bank and for the bank to repay billion to the company s foreign based subsidiary 
the financial impact of early termination depends on the manner and extent to which the company decides to finance its us repayment obligation 
the company could finance its entire obligation by obtaining short or long term financing in the united states 
in this case  cash and debt would increase by equal amounts in the consolidated balance sheet 
however  the company s ability to finance its obligation under the swaps will depend on the company s credit ratings and business operations  as well as market conditions  at the time such financing is contemplated 
alternatively  the company could repatriate to the united states some or all of the funds received by the foreign based subsidiary 
repatriating funds could have us income tax consequences depending primarily on profitability of the us operations 
any such tax would be accrued against future earnings  and may result in the company reporting a higher effective tax rate 
currently  the us operations are generating tax losses 
however  future tax 
table of contents losses may be insufficient to absorb any or all of the potential tax should the company repatriate some or all of the funds received by the foreign based subsidiary 
as stated above  termination of the transaction cannot occur earlier than months following the date on which the company receives a termination notice from the counterparty 
accordingly  early termination is not imminent 
due to this fact  as well as the alternative courses of action available to the company in the event of early termination  the potential of early termination does not impact current liquidity and financial resources 
the second arrangement utilizes long term interest rate swap contracts  one entered into in with a notional principal of million and a second entered into in with a notional principal of million 
the terms of these contracts enable the company to sell the right to receive payments while retaining the obligation to make payments 
in and  the us parent company sold the rights to receive payments under both contracts to a foreign based subsidiary in return for approximately million fair value 
this intercompany transaction has been eliminated in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the internal revenue service has asserted that these transactions were not a sale but a loan on which additional us income taxes are due 
the company expects to litigate this matter as described in the legal  environmental and regulatory matters footnote to the financial statements 
the contracts allow the counterparty to effectively terminate the transaction if the company fails to maintain the required minimum credit ratings and within days does not restore at least one of the required minimum credit ratings 
the company s credit rating fell below the required minimum credit rating on february  it is unlikely the company will restore at least one of its credit ratings in the allotted time 
early termination of these contracts due to a credit rating downgrade would most likely result in the us parent company reacquiring the right to receive payments from its foreign based subsidiary and terminating the transaction with the counterparty on a net basis 
the reacquisition of the rights to receive payments under the swap contracts would occur either by the us parent company buying back the rights for their fair market value or by having the foreign based subsidiary dividend the rights back to the us parent company 
buying back the rights would necessitate funding in the united states  which the company currently estimates would be approximately million 
in this case  cash and debt would increase by equal amounts in the consolidated balance sheet 
alternatively  having the foreign based subsidiary dividend the rights back to the us parent company could result in additional us income taxes 
presently  the us operations of the company are generating tax losses 
these losses are expected to exceed the value of the intercompany dividend necessary to reacquire the rights 
as a result  in the event of early termination  management has the alternative of reacquiring the rights and terminating the transaction with the counterparty without materially impacting liquidity or financial resources 
accordingly  management does not view early termination of this arrangement to be a material event impacting current liquidity and financial resources 

table of contents contractual obligations payments due by period under the company s known contractual obligations at december   are as follows dollars in millions payments due by period less more than than total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations advertising contracts research contracts capital expenditure commitments other purchase orders other recorded long term liabilities total long term debt obligations include the  million aggregate principal amount of percent senior  unsecured notes due and  million aggregate principal amount of percent senior  unsecured notes due see financial instruments and commitments footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
research contracts do not include any potential milestone payments to be made since such payments are contingent on the occurrence of certain events 
the table also excludes those research contracts that are cancelable by the company without penalty 
other open purchase orders consist of both cancelable and noncancelable inventory and expense items 
this caption includes obligations  based on undiscounted amounts  for estimated payments under certain of the company s pension plans that do not hold qualified assets and estimated payments under the company s deferred compensation plans 
environmental matters the company has responsibilities for environmental cleanup under various state  local and federal laws  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  commonly known as superfund 
environmental expenditures have not had and  based on information currently available  are not anticipated to have a material impact on the company 
for additional information  see the legal  environmental and regulatory matters footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents additional factors influencing operations in the united states  many of the company s pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups  institutions  government agencies and other groups seek price discounts 
in most international markets  the company operates in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs 
in the us market  the company and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in medicaid  the veterans health care program and other government funded programs 
several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements  emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across the board price cuts as methods to control costs 
since the company is unable to predict the final form and timing of any future domestic or international governmental or other health care initiatives  including the passage of laws permitting the importation of pharmaceuticals into the united states  their effect on operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated 
similarly  the effect on operations and cash flows of decisions of government entities  managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be reasonably estimated 
the company cannot predict what net effect the medicare prescription drug benefit will have on markets and sales 
the program does not go into effect until and many of the company s leading drugs are already covered under medicare part b eg temodar  integrilin and intron a 
others have a relatively small portion of their sales to the medicare population eg clarinex  the hepatitis c franchise 
the company could experience expanded utilization of zetia and new drugs in the company s r d pipeline 
of greater consequence for the company may be the legislation s impact on pricing  rebates and discounts 
a significant portion of net sales are made to major pharmaceutical and health care products distributors and major retail chains in the united states 
consequently  net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors  retail chains and other trade buyers 
these fluctuations may result from seasonality  pricing  wholesaler buying decisions or other factors 
the market for pharmaceutical products is competitive 
the company s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors  industry consolidation  patents granted to competitors  new products of competitors and generic competition as the company s products mature 
in addition  patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors  and the outcome can be highly uncertain 
an adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products 
the effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted 
as noted in the legal  environmental and regulatory matters footnote included in the financial statements to this report  the company has sued drug manufacturers that are marketing or seeking to market certain forms of generic loratadine prior to the expiration of the company s compound patent for desloratadine 
in each case  the company has filed suit in federal court seeking a ruling that the applicable abbreviated new drug application anda or paper new drug application submission and proposed marketing of a generic prescription or otc product 
table of contents constitute infringement of the company s patents and that the challenge to the patents is without merit 
the compound patent for loratadine expired on june   and us market exclusivity for claritin expired on december  a patent covering the compound desloratadine  formulations thereof  and methods of treatment with desloratadine as it relates to claritin is set to expire on april  six months us market exclusivity would attach to the end of the desloratadine patent as it relates to claritin and would expire on october  this six month period of exclusivity was granted because the company conducted pediatric clinical trials at the request of the fda 
on august   a federal district court in new jersey ruled on motions for summary judgment  finding that certain of the desloratadine compound patent claims  which the company believes protect claritin  were anticipated by a prior patent and  thus  were not valid 
on august   the district court s decision was sustained by the appellate court  and on october   the appellate court denied the company s petition for rehearing 
with these rulings  actions against the defendants for infringement of the desloratadine compound patent by manufacturers of loratadine will not proceed 
the company had also asserted that andas filed by two manufacturers for generic versions of claritin d hour infringe the company s patent covering claritin d hour 
the company settled this litigation with impax and andrx in october and has licensed them under this patent 
on november   the company announced that all five formulations of the claritin brand of non drowsy allergy products had been approved at their original prescription strengths by the fda as otc medicines for the treatment of allergies 
the company also has been informed by the fda that the new drug applications ndas for these claritin formulations  as well as for all indications allergies and hives  will be transferred from the fda s pulmonary division office of drug evaluation ii to the division of over the counter drug products office of drug evaluation v 
the company launched otc claritin in the united states in december also in december  a competing otc loratadine product was launched in the united states 
in the third quarter of  the company began to face additional private label competition for its otc claritin line of nonsedating antihistamines  as the initial day period of exclusivity expired for the first otc generic competitor 
the company continues to market clarinex desloratadine mg tablets for the treatment of allergic rhinitis  which combines the indication of seasonal allergic rhinitis with the indication of perennial allergic rhinitis  as well as the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria  or hives of unknown cause 
the ability of the company to capture and maintain market share for clarinex and otc claritin in the us market will depend on a number of factors  including additional entrants in the market for allergy treatments  clinical differentiation of clarinex from other allergy treatments and the perception of the extent of such differentiation in the marketplace  the pricing differentials among otc claritin  clarinex  other allergy treatments and generic otc loratadine  the erosion rate of otc claritin and clarinex sales upon the entry of additional generic otc loratadine products  and whether or not one or both of the other branded second generation antihistamines are switched from prescription to otc status 
clarinex is experiencing intense competition in the prescription us allergy market 
the prescription allergy market has been shrinking since the otc switch of claritin 
table of contents in december the company is implementing new marketing efforts to address market share performance for clarinex 
the switch of claritin to otc status and the introduction of competing otc loratadine has resulted in a rapid  sharp and material decline in claritin sales in the united states and the company s results of operations 
us sales of prescription claritin products were million or percent of the company s consolidated global sales in and billion or percent in sales of clarinex in the united states and abroad have also been materially adversely affected by the presence of generic otc loratadine and otc claritin 
in light of the factors described above  management believes that the company s december introduction of otc claritin  as well as the introduction of a competing otc loratadine product in december and additional entrants of generic otc loratadine products in the market  have had a rapid  sharp and material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and will likely continue for an indeterminate period of time 
as disclosed in filings with the us securities and exchange commission sec and as noted in the legal  environmental and regulatory matters footnote included in the financial statements to this report  three drug manufacturers have submitted andas to the fda seeking to market generic forms of rebetol ribavirin capsules in the united states before the expiration of the company s patents covering ribavirin formulations 
the company has sued those manufacturers in federal court for infringement 
during  the company entered into separate licensing agreements with three rivers pharmaceuticals  llc three rivers  geneva pharmaceuticals  inc geneva and teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc 
teva that settled all patent litigation between the company  three rivers  geneva and teva and granted those three companies each a non exclusive  non sublicensable license to the company s us ribavirin patents 
these settlements do not affect three rivers  geneva s or teva s reported patent litigation with ribapharm  inc  a subsidiary of valeant pharmaceuticals international  ribapharm  relating to ribavirin patents 
that litigation was dismissed upon defendants motion for summary judgment on july  ribapharm has appealed the summary judgment decision 
ribapharm has also petitioned the fda to deny approval of the three rivers  geneva and teva products 
the fda has not acted on the ribapharm petition 
generic forms of ribavirin are expected to enter the us market in  assuming fda s approval of a generic ribavirin 
the rebetol patents are material to the company s business 
us sales of rebetol in were million 
peg intron and rebetol combination therapy for hepatitis c contributed substantially to sales in and during the fourth quarter of  a competing pegylated interferon based combination product  including a brand of ribavirin  received regulatory approval in most major markets  including the united states 
the overall market share of the intron franchise has declined sharply  reflecting this new market competition 
management believes that the ability of peg intron and rebetol combination therapy to maintain market share will continue to be adversely affected by new competition in the hepatitis c marketplace 
in october  merck schering plough pharmaceuticals announced that the fda approved zetia ezetimibe mg for use either by itself or together with statins for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels 
in march  the company announced that ezetimibe ezetrol  
table of contents as marketed in europe had successfully completed the european union eu mutual recognition procedure mrp 
with the completion of the mrp process  the eu member states as well as iceland and norway can grant national marketing authorization with unified labeling for ezetrol 
ezetrol has been launched in many international markets 
the merck schering plough partnership is also pursuing the development and marketing of a once daily tablet combining ezetimibe with simvastatin zocor  merck s cholesterol modifying medicine 
uncertainties inherent in government regulatory approval processes  including  among other things  delays in approval of new products  formulations or indications  may also affect the company s operations 
the effect of regulatory approval processes on operations cannot be predicted 
the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various national  state and local regulatory agencies and is  therefore  subject to potential administrative actions 
of particular importance is the fda in the united states 
it has jurisdiction over all the company s businesses and administers requirements covering the testing  safety  effectiveness  approval  manufacturing  labeling and marketing of the company s products 
from time to time  agencies  including the fda  may require the company to address various manufacturing  advertising  labeling or other regulatory issues  such as those noted below relating to the company s current manufacturing issues 
failure to comply with governmental regulations can result in delays in the release of products  seizure or recall of products  suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products  discontinuance of products  fines and other civil or criminal sanctions 
any such result could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and its results of operations 
additional information regarding government regulation that may affect future results is provided in part i  item i  business  in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  additional information about cautionary factors that may affect future results is provided under the caption cautionary factors that may affect future results cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of in this management s discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition 
as noted in the consent decree footnote included in the financial statements to this report  on may   the company announced that it had reached an agreement with the fda for a consent decree to resolve issues involving the company s compliance with current good manufacturing practices at certain manufacturing facilities in new jersey and puerto rico 
the us district court for the district of new jersey approved and entered the consent decree on may  under terms of the consent decree  the company agreed to pay a total of million to the us government in two equal installments of million  the first installment was paid in may and the second installment was paid in the second quarter of as previously reported  the company accrued a million provision for this consent decree in the fourth quarter of the consent decree requires the company to complete a number of actions 
in the event certain actions agreed upon in the consent decree are not satisfactorily completed on time  the fda may assess payments for each deadline missed 
the consent decree required the company to develop 
table of contents and submit for fda s concurrence comprehensive cgmp work plans for the company s manufacturing facilities in new jersey and puerto rico that are covered by the decree 
the company received fda concurrence with its proposed cgmp work plans on may  the cgmp work plans contain a number of significant steps whose timely and satisfactory completion are subject to payments of  per business day for each deadline missed 
these payments may not exceed million for  and million for each of the years  and these payments are subject to an overall cap of million 
in connection with its discussions with fda regarding the company s cgmp work plans  and pursuant to the terms of the decree  the company and the fda entered into a letter agreement dated april  in the letter agreement the company and the fda agreed to extend by six months the time period during which the company may incur payments as described above with respect to certain of the significant steps whose proposed due dates are december  the letter agreement does not increase the yearly or overall caps on payments described above 
in addition  the decree requires the company to complete programs of revalidation of the finished drug products and bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured at the covered manufacturing facilities 
the company is required under the consent decree to complete its revalidation programs for bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients by september   and for finished drugs by december  in general  the timely and satisfactory completion of the revalidations are subject to payments of  per business day for each deadline missed  subject to the caps described above 
however  if a product scheduled for revalidation has not been certified as having been validated by the last date on the validation schedule  the fda may assess a payment of percent of the net domestic sales of the uncertified product until the validation is certified 
further  in general  if a product scheduled for revalidation under the consent decree is not certified within six months of its scheduled date  the company must cease production of that product until certification is obtained 
the completion of the significant steps in the work plans and the completion of the revalidation programs are subject to third party expert certification  which must be accepted by the fda 
the consent decree provides that if the company believes that it may not be able to meet a deadline  the company has the right  upon the showing of good cause  to request extensions of deadlines in connection with the cgmp work plans and revalidation programs 
however  there is no guarantee that fda will grant any such requests 
although the company believes it has made significant progress in meeting its obligations under the consent decree  it is possible that the company may fail to complete a significant step or a revalidation by the prescribed deadline  the third party expert may not certify the completion of the significant step or revalidation  or the fda may disagree with an expert s certification of a significant step or revalidation 
in such a case  it is possible that the fda may assess payments as described above 
the company would expense any payments assessed under the decree if and when incurred 

table of contents in addition  the failure to meet the terms of the consent decree could result in delays in approval of new products  seizure or recall of products  suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products  fines and other civil or criminal sanctions 
in april  the company received notice of a false claims act complaint brought by an individual purporting to act on behalf of the us government against it and approximately other pharmaceutical companies in the us district court for the northern district of texas 
the complaint alleges that the pharmaceutical companies  including the company  have defrauded the united states by having made sales to various federal governmental agencies of drugs that were allegedly manufactured in a manner that did not comply with current good manufacturing practices 
the company and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action on july  the company is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions  including the united states  the european union eu and the eu member states 
the requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  but all include requirements for reporting adverse events that occur while a patient is using a particular drug in order to alert the manufacturer of the drug and the governmental agency to potential problems 
during pharmacovigilance inspections by officials of the british and french medicines agencies conducted at the request of the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products emea  serious deficiencies in reporting processes were identified 
the company is taking urgent actions to rectify these deficiencies as quickly as possible 
the company does not know what action  if any  the emea or national authorities will take in response to these findings 
possible actions include further inspections  demands for improvements in reporting systems  criminal sanctions against the company and or responsible individuals and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for the company s products 
as described more specifically in the legal  environmental and regulatory matters footnote included in the financial statements to this report  to which the reader of this report is directed  the pricing  sales and marketing programs and arrangements  and related business practices of the company and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory  investigative  prosecutorial and administrative entities 
these entities include the department of justice and its us attorney s offices  the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  the fda  the federal trade commission ftc and various state attorneys general offices 
many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate  including the federal and state anti kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws  have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion 
in the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred  one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings  which  if instituted and resolved unfavorably  could subject the company to substantial fines  penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies  including exclusion from government reimbursement programs  and the company also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or 
table of contents sales 
any such result could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial condition or its results of operations 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies are considered significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the company s financial statements accrual of rebates on sales of pharmaceuticals in the united states  provision for income taxes for undistributed foreign earnings and intercompany pricing matters  impairment of intangible assets  and accounting for legal and regulatory matters 
pharmaceutical products are sold to direct purchasers eg  wholesalers  retailers and certain health maintenance organizations  and the company invoices those entities when the products are shipped 
in addition  the company has commercial rebate and discount arrangements with certain indirect purchasers and other market participants eg  managed care organizations that indemnify beneficiaries of health plans for their pharmaceutical costs and pharmacy benefit managers based upon the purchase or utilization of company products 
the company also has governmental rebate obligations under certain federal and state programs 
for purposes of revenue recognition  the company at the end of each quarter estimates the applicable commercial and governmental rebates that will be paid for products sold during the quarter and nets those estimated amounts from the total direct sales 
these rebates are estimated based on terms  historical experience  trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served 
in the case of the governmental rebate programs  the company s payments involve interpretations of relevant statutes and regulations 
these interpretations are subject to challenges and changes in interpretive guidance by governmental authorities 
the result of such a challenge or change could affect whether the estimated governmental rebate amounts are ultimately sufficient to satisfy the company s obligations 
additional information on governmental inquiries focused in part on the calculation of rebates is contained in the legal  environmental and regulatory matters footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report 
in addition  it is possible that  as a result of governmental challenges or changes in interpretive guidance  actual rebates could materially exceed amounts accrued 
as of december   taxes have not been provided on approximately billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
management has determined that the assets associated with these earnings have been permanently reinvested in the company s overseas operations 
if future events require that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united states  additional tax provisions may be necessary 
also with regard to income taxes  certain of the company s consolidated subsidiaries manufacture pharmaceutical ingredients at facilities located in low tax jurisdictions 
these manufacturing subsidiaries sell the pharmaceutical ingredients to other consolidated subsidiaries for further manufacturing and final sale to customers 
taxing authorities throughout the world 
table of contents can challenge the prices charged by the manufacturing subsidiaries 
management believes its pricing is based upon sound economic facts and circumstances 
however  a successful challenge by a taxing authority  which management believes is unlikely  could result in additional income tax payments materially in excess of amounts accrued 
intangible assets representing the capitalized costs of purchased goodwill  patents  licenses and other forms of intellectual property totaled million at december  the value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific  medical and marketplace uncertainty 
for example  if a marketed pharmaceutical product were to be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons or if marketing of a product could only occur with pronounced warnings  amounts capitalized for such a product may need to be reduced due to impairment 
events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted 
management regularly reviews intangible assets for possible impairment 
as discussed in the special charges section  the company recognized asset impairment losses in for intangible assets 
asset impairment losses were recognized for an intangible asset related to a cancer therapy drug due to scientific advancements and for an intangible asset relating to the trade name of a sun care product due to marketplace competition 
management judgments and estimates are also required in the accounting for legal and regulatory matters 
in particular  the company has recognized estimated minimum liabilities in connection with certain of the government investigations into its sales and marketing activities 
see legal  environmental and regulatory matters footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
market risk disclosures the company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  from interest rates and equity prices 
the following describes the nature of these risks 
foreign currency exchange risk the company has subsidiaries in more than countries 
in  sales outside the united states accounted for approximately percent of global sales 
virtually all these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country 
as such  the company s reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates 
in  changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by percent and increased diluted earnings per common share by 
to date  management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of foreign operations using derivative financial instruments 
because the company s foreign subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in us dollars  managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover provides a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates 
the risk of adverse exchange rate change is also mitigated by the fact that the company s foreign operations are widespread 

table of contents in addition  at any point in time  the company s foreign subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
these financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short term  third party and intercompany receivables and payables 
changes in exchange rates affect these financial assets and liabilities 
for the most part  however  gains or losses arise from translation and  as such  do not significantly affect net income 
on occasion  the company has used derivatives to hedge specific short term risk situations involving foreign currency exposures 
however  these derivative transactions have not been material 
interest rate and equity price risk the only financial assets exposed to changes in interest rates and or equity prices are the debt and equity securities held in non qualified trusts for employee benefits 
these assets totaled million at december  due to the long term nature of the liabilities that these trust assets will fund  the company s exposure to market risk is deemed to be low 
the only financial obligations exposed to variability in interest expense are short term borrowings 
the company maintains a cash and cash equivalent portfolio well in excess of the amount of short term borrowings 
accordingly  the company has no net exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its financial obligations 
the company has long term debt outstanding  on which a percent decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of the debt by million 
however  the company does not expect to refund this debt 
interest rate swaps in and  the company utilized interest rate swaps as part of its international cash management strategy 
for additional information  see the financial instruments and commitments footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these swaps subject the company to a moderate degree of market risk 
the company accounts for these swaps using fair value accounting  with changes in the fair value recorded in earnings 
the fair value of these swaps was a liability of million at december   and a liability of million at december  it is estimated that a percent change in interest rate structure could change the fair value of the swaps by less than million 

table of contents cautionary factors that may affect future results cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events 
they use words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  forecast  project  intend  plan  potential  will  and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of potential future events  circumstances or future operating or financial performance 
you can also identify forward looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
in particular  forward looking statements include statements relating to future actions  ability to access the capital markets  prospective products  the status of product approvals  future performance or results of current and anticipated products  sales efforts  development programs  expenses and programs to reduce expenses  the cost of and savings from the verp  the outcome of contingencies such as litigation and investigations  growth strategy and financial results 
any or all forward looking statements here or in other publications may turn out to be wrong 
actual results may vary materially  and there are no guarantees about the performance of schering plough stock 
schering plough does not assume the obligation to update any forward looking statement 
many factors could cause actual results to differ from schering plough s forward looking statements 
these factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties  including some that are known and some that are not 
although it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors  they may include the following a significant portion of net sales are made to major pharmaceutical and health care products distributors and major retail chains in the united states 
consequently  net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors  retail chains and other trade buyers 
these fluctuations may result from seasonality  pricing  wholesaler buying decisions or other factors 
competitive factors  including technological advances attained by competitors  patents granted to competitors  new products of competitors coming to the market  new indications for competitive products or generic prescription or otc competition as schering plough s products mature and patents expire on products 
increased pricing pressure both in the united states and abroad from managed care organizations  institutions and government agencies and programs 
in the united states  among other developments  consolidation among customers may increase pricing pressures and may result in various customers having greater influence over prescription decisions through formulary decisions and other policies 
government laws and regulations and changes in laws and regulations affecting domestic and international operations including health care reform initiatives and drug importation legislation in the united states at the state and federal level and in other 
table of contents countries  as well as laws and regulations relating to trade  antitrust  monetary and fiscal policies  taxes  price controls and possible nationalization 
patent positions can be highly uncertain and patent disputes are not unusual 
an adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively impact sales of existing products or result in injunctive relief and payment of financial remedies 
uncertainties of the fda approval process and the regulatory approval and review processes in other countries  including  without limitation  delays in approval of new products 
failure to meet good manufacturing practices established by the fda and other governmental authorities can result in delays in the approval of products  release of products  seizure or recall of products  suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products  fines and other civil or criminal sanctions 
the resolution of manufacturing issues with the fda discussed in schering plough s ks  qs and ks are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties  including the timing  scope and duration of a resolution of the manufacturing issues  will depend on the ability of schering plough to assure the fda of the quality and reliability of its manufacturing systems and controls  and the extent of remedial and prospective obligations undertaken by schering plough 
difficulties in product development 
pharmaceutical product development is highly uncertain 
products that appear promising in development may fail to reach market for numerous reasons 
they may be found to be ineffective or to have harmful side effects in clinical or pre clinical testing  they may fail to receive the necessary regulatory approvals  they may turn out not to be economically feasible because of manufacturing costs or other factors or they may be precluded from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others 
efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products  whether or not scientifically justified  leading to recalls  withdrawals or declining sales 
major products such as claritin  clarinex  intron a  peg intron  rebetol capsules  remicade and nasonex accounted for a material portion of schering plough s revenues 
if any major product were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection  otc availability of the company s product or a competitive product as has been disclosed for claritin and its current and potential otc competition  previously unknown side effects  if a new  more effective treatment should be introduced  generic availability of competitive products  or if the product is discontinued for any reason  the impact on revenues could be significant 
further  such information about important new products  such as zetia  or important products in our pipeline  may impact future revenues 
unfavorable outcomes of government local and federal  domestic and international investigations  litigation about product pricing  product liability claims  other litigation and environmental concerns could preclude commercialization of products  negatively affect the profitability of existing products  materially and adversely impact schering plough s financial condition and results of operations  or contain conditions that impact business operations  such as exclusion from government reimbursement programs 
economic factors over which schering plough has no control  including changes in inflation  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents instability  disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region due to the location of manufacturing facilities  distribution facilities or customers regardless of cause  including war  terrorism  riot  civil insurrection or social unrest  and natural or man made disasters  including famine  flood  fire  earthquake  storm or diseases
