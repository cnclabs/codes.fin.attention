management overview of reportable operating segments the company is a multinational company which provides sophisticated services and related products to a variety of markets 
management defines the company s operational organizational structure into discrete divisions based on its primary product lines 
each division comprises a combination of individual district offices  which primarily offer similar types of services and serve similar types of markets 
although individual offices within a division may periodically perform services normally provided by another division  the results of those services are recorded in the office s own division 
for example  if a water resources division office performed geoconstruction services  the revenues would be recorded in the water resources division rather than the geoconstruction division 
should an office s primary responsibility move from one division president to another  that office s results going forward would be reclassified between divisions at that time 
the company s reportable segments are defined as follows water resources division this division provides a full line of water related services and products including hydrological studies  site selection  well design  drilling and well development  pump installation  and repair and maintenance 
the division s offerings include the design and construction of water treatment facilities and the manufacture and sale of products to treat volatile organics and other contaminants such as nitrates  iron  manganese  arsenic  radium and radon in groundwater 
the division also offers environmental services to assess and monitor groundwater contaminants 
effective february   the company s ground freezing services were included in the division on a prospective basis due to a change in reporting responsibility 
the division s operations rely heavily on the municipal sector as approximately of the division s fiscal revenues were derived from the municipal market 
the municipal sector has been adversely impacted by the slow us economy 
reduced tax revenues have limited spending and new development by local municipalities 
generally  spending levels in the municipal sector lag an economic recovery and are expected to remain at reduced levels for the first half of next year 
in addition to the reduced spending levels in the municipal market  the company has also experienced reduced demand for its services in the industrial markets 
the soft markets have increased the competitive challenges for the division as competitors have been very aggressive on pricing 
the division s margins have been adversely affected as the result of a focused effort to maintain market share in a difficult environment 
as the us economy begins to recover  the company expects activity levels within the water markets to improve along with pricing 
the division is also expanding its water treatment product offerings and expects to see growth in water treatment sales in fiscal mineral exploration division this division provides a complete range of drilling services for the mineral exploration industry 
its aboveground and underground drilling activities include all phases of core drilling  diamond  reverse circulation  dual tube  hammer and rotary air blast methods 
demand for the company s mineral exploration drilling services depends upon the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies  particularly with respect to gold and copper 
mineral exploration is highly speculative and is influenced by a variety of factors  including the prevailing prices for various metals that often fluctuate widely 
in this connection  the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in fiscal  the mineral exploration division experienced the first increase in worldwide exploration spending since  driven primarily by increased gold and base metals prices 
the division relies heavily on mining activity in africa as of total division revenues for fiscal were generated in africa 
the company believes this concentration of risk is mitigated by working for larger international mining companies and the establishment of permanent operating facilities in africa 
operating difficulties in africa  including but not limited to  political instability  workforce instability  harsh environment  disease and remote locations  all create natural barriers to entry in this market by competitors 
the company believes it has positioned itself as the market leader in africa and has established the infrastructure to operate effectively 
the division expects to experience continued growth next year as mining activity accelerates 
geoconstruction division this division focuses on services that improve soil stability  primarily jet grouting  grouting  vibratory ground improvement  drilled micropiles  stone columns  anchors and tie backs 
the division also manufactures a line of high pressure pumping equipment used in grouting operations and geotechnical drilling rigs used for directional drilling 
effective february   the division no longer includes the company s ground freezing services due to a change in reporting responsibility 
the geoconstruction division frequently acts as a subcontractor to heavy civil construction contractors and governmental agencies 
in many cases  circumstances outside of the company s control are inherent in a subcontractor relationship 
consequently  the division could experience delays on projects that could have a material adverse effect on the division 
the company expects the volume of large  construction type projects utilizing the company s services to improve next year in conjunction with the us economic recovery 
energy division this division primarily focuses on exploration and production of coalbed methane cbm properties in the united states 
to date it has been concentrated on projects in the mid continent region of the united states 
historically  the division has also included service businesses in shallow gas and tar sands exploration drilling  conventional oilfield fishing services and coil tubing fishing services 
during fiscal  the division s strategy shifted to focus mainly on resource development rather than providing services to external customers 
accordingly  in january  the company sold its canadian drilling unit to ensign drilling and its oilfield fishing services to smith international 
the results of operations for these units have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all years presented see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the division is now composed of the company s cbm development activities and two small  specialty energy service companies 
upon the sale of the two businesses in fiscal  the company has re positioned the division to focus mainly on exploration and production activities associated with its cbm properties 
the expansion of the company s energy segment is contingent upon significant cash investments to develop the company s unproved acreage 
as of january   the company has invested  in oil and gas related assets and expects to spend approximately  in development activities associated with its cbm efforts in fiscal the production curve for a typical cbm well is generally years 
accordingly  the company expects to earn a return on its investment through production proceeds over the next years 
however  future revenues and profits will be dependent upon a number of factors including consumption levels for natural gas  commodity prices  the economic feasibility of gas exploration and production and the discovery rate of new gas reserves 
the company expects to have approximately gross producing wells on line by the end of the first quarter of fiscal operating losses in the division are expected through the third quarter of fiscal until sufficient production volumes are generated to offset the division s level of fixed costs 
products and other this grouping has historically included the company s supply operation which distributed drilling equipment  parts and supplies  a manufacturing operation producing diamond drilling rigs  diamond bits  core barrels and drill rods christensen products and other miscellaneous operations which do not fall into the above divisions 
on january   the company sold its supply operation to boart longyear 
upon the sale  the results of operations were reclassified to discontinued operations for all years presented see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on august   the company sold its christensen products business to a subsidiary of atlas copco see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the decrease in unallocated corporate expenses was primarily the result of lower incentive related accruals for the year 
fluctuation in quarterly results the company historically has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly results arising from the timing of the award and completion of contracts  the recording of related revenues and unanticipated additional costs incurred on projects 
the company s revenues on large  long term drilling contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis for individual contracts based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
a significant number of the company s contracts contain fixed prices and assign responsibility to the company for cost overruns for the subject projects  as a result  revenues and gross margin may vary from those originally estimated and  depending upon the size of the project  variations from estimated contract performance could affect the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
many of the company s contracts are also subject to cancellation by the customer upon short notice with limited damages payable to the company 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  force majeure and other similar events can curtail company operations in various regions of the world throughout the year  resulting in performance delays and increased costs 
moreover  the company s domestic drilling activities and related revenues and earnings tend to decrease in the winter months when adverse weather conditions interfere with access to drilling sites and the ability to drill  as a result  the company s revenues and earnings in its second and third quarters tend to be higher than revenues and earnings in its first and fourth quarters 
accordingly  as a result of the foregoing as well as other factors  quarterly results should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year 
see the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
inflation management believes that the company s operations for the periods discussed have not been adversely affected by inflation or changing prices from its suppliers 
liquidity and capital resources management exercises discretion regarding the liquidity and capital resource needs of its business segments 
this includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity  to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding capital expenditures 
the company s primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash from operations  supplemented by borrowings under its credit facilities 
cash from operating activities was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash from operations and borrowings under the credit facilities in were used to fund capital spending of  during the year 
in fiscal  the company expects to continue its expansion into the production of coalbed methane gas 
capital expenditure estimates for fiscal include approximately  related to coalbed methane development and  to upgrade equipment and facilities in the company s other divisions 
as of january   the company had no material commitments outstanding for capital assets 
the company maintains an agreement the master shelf agreement whereby it can issue up to  in unsecured notes

the remaining  of notes under the master shelf agreement are available for issuance at market rates until july issuance of the notes is contingent on  among other things  compliance with financial covenants in the master shelf and credit agreements 
the company was in compliance with its financial covenants at january  and expects to remain in compliance through the foreseeable future 
the company s working capital as of january   and  was   and  respectively

excluding cash and cash equivalents  working capital as of january   and would have been   and  respectively 
working capital was also comparatively lower at january  due to  in current maturities under then existing credit facilities  which were refinanced on a long term basis in fiscal the increased working capital at january  is discussed in more detail below 
the company believes it will have sufficient cash from operations and access to credit facilities to meet the company s operating cash requirements and to fund its budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal operating activities cash from operating activities  including discontinued operations  decreased  to  for the year ended january  the decrease in cash from operations in was primarily attributable to increased working capital  primarily caused by increased receivable balances in the company s operating divisions 
the increased receivables for fiscal were primarily a result of increased balances related to layne canada due to a busier winter drilling season compared to last year  increased activity levels in the mineral exploration division  and a slowing of collections from water resources and geoconstruction division customers 
the increased receivables were also attributable to receivables from our joint interest partners on coalbed methane projects 
the increased receivable balances were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable due to increased activity levels in the minerals division  costs related to the company s pipeline construction on a cbm project in the midwest and closing accruals and lease termination liabilities associated with the sale of layne canada 
investing activities the company s capital expenditures of  for fiscal were directed primarily toward the company s expansion into coalbed methane exploration and production  including the construction of gas pipeline infrastructure near the company s development projects 
expenditures related to the company s cbm efforts totaled  during fiscal the remaining capital expenditures were directed towards expansion and upgrading of the company s equipment and facilities primarily in the water resources and mineral exploration divisions 
investing activities for fiscal also include the proceeds from the sale of businesses of  and business acquisitions of  the company sold layne canada on january   and received  upon closing 
on january   the company sold toledo oil and gas and received  upon closing 
an additional payment of  related to the sale of toledo was received in february during fiscal  the company acquired mohajir engineering group for  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition positioned the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in the coalbed methane development market 
financing activities the company s financing activities primarily related to the issuance of  in notes under the master shelf agreement  borrowings of  under the company s revolving credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options during the year 
proceeds from option exercises were unusually high in fiscal due to increases in the company s stock price and a large number of options with impending expiration dates 
the proceeds from issuance of the notes were used to pay the outstanding borrowings under the company s previous credit facilities  a prepayment penalty related to the previous loan facilities and issuance costs related to the master shelf agreement and the company s new revolving credit facility 
financing activities also include note payments related to the company s acquisition of the drillcorp assets in november see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments are summarized as follows in thousands payments expiration by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations and other commercial commitments credit facilities     operating leases     lease termination costs   mineral interest obligations drillcorp promissory note    total contractual cash obligations      standby letters of credit   asset retirement obligations total contractual obligations and commercial commitments      the company expects to meet its contractual cash obligations in the ordinary course of operations  and that the standby letters of credit will be renewed in connection with its annual insurance renewal process 
the company incurs additional obligations in the ordinary course of operations 
these obligations  including but not limited to  interest payments on debt  income tax payments and pension fundings are expected to be met in the normal course of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the company believes that the following represents the more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized on large  long term contracts using the percentage of completion method based upon materials installed and labor costs incurred 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
goodwill and other intangibles in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 which was effective for the company as of february  sfas no 
substantially changed the accounting for goodwill  requiring that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives cease to be amortized  and instead periodically tested for impairment 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of december each year 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the company s reporting units 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about the company s strategic plans with regard to its operations 
the company believes at this time that the carrying value of the remaining goodwill is appropriate  although to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s conclusions regarding impairment of the remaining goodwill could change and result in a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
other long lived assets in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  including the company s coalbed methane assets  the company performs an analysis of the anticipated future net cash flows of the related long lived assets and reduce their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
the company believes at january   that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
accrued insurance expense the company maintains insurance programs where it is responsible for a certain amount of each claim up to a self insured limit 
estimates are recorded for health and welfare  property and casualty insurance costs that are associated with these programs 
these costs are estimated based on actuarially determined projections of future payments under these programs 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the medical profession increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs to the consolidated financial statements could be required 
costs estimated to be incurred in the future for employee medical benefits  property and casualty insurance programs resulting from claims which have occurred are accrued currently 
under the terms of the company s agreement with the various insurance carriers administering these claims  the company is not required to remit the total premium until the claims are actually paid by the insurance companies 
these costs are not expected to significantly impact liquidity in future periods see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are provided using the asset liability method  in which deferred taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided as necessary 
provision for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and foreign affiliates is made only on those amounts in excess of those funds considered to be invested indefinitely see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation and other contingencies the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business  the disposition of which is expected to have no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions related to these proceedings 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s estimate of its probable liability in these matters may change 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk on variable rate debt and foreign exchange rate risk that could give rise to translation and transaction gains and losses 
the company centrally manages its debt portfolio considering overall financing strategies and tax consequences 
a description of the company s debt is included in notes of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
as of january   the  of the company s debt outstanding is fixed rate debt and  is variable rate debt 
accordingly  an instantaneous change in interest rates of one percentage point would not significantly impact the company s annual interest expense 
operating in international markets involves exposure to possible volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
currently  the company s primary international operations are in australia  africa  mexico and italy
