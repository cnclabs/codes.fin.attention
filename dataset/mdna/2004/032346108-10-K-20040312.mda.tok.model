item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview amylin pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of drug candidates for the treatment of diabetes  obesity and cardiovascular disease 
we have two first in class lead drug candidates in late stage development for the treatment of diabetes that have completed phase clinical trials  symlin pramlintide acetate and exenatide 
we are developing exenatide  including both twice daily and sustained release formulations  with our partner eli lilly and company  or lilly  pursuant to a global development and commercialization collaboration agreement signed in september the agreement provides for equal sharing of exenatide expenses and operating profits in the united states 
outside of the united states  lilly leads development and regulatory efforts and is responsible for of the development expenses and of the commercial expenses 
future operating profits from outside of the united states will be split to lilly and to us 
we have two early stage development programs for the treatment of obesity  including a phase program for ac pramlintide acetate and a phase program for ac pyy 
we are studying ac glp  in a phase program for the treatment of patients with severe congestive heart failure 
our drug candidate ac is in a phase program for the treatment of atherosclerosis related cardiovascular disease 
we maintain a focused discovery research program concentrated on peptide therapeutics and we are actively seeking to in license additional drug candidates 
since our inception in september  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
all of our revenues to date have been derived from fees and expense reimbursements under our exenatide collaboration agreement with lilly and previous symlin collaborative agreements 
we currently have no approved products and we have not received any revenues from the sale of any of our drug candidates 
we have been unprofitable since inception and expect to incur additional operating losses for at least the next few years 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we do not expect to generate positive operating cash flows for at least the next few years and accordingly  we expect that we will need to raise additional funds from outside sources 
refer to the discussion under the heading liquidity and capital resources for more detailed information regarding our anticipated future financing requirements 
research and development programs currently  our research and development efforts are focused on seven programs in various stages of development as detailed in the following table program indication development status planned milestones symlin type and insulin using type diabetes second fda approvable letter received in late discussions with fda ongoing clarify fda requirements for approval exenatide type diabetes pivotal phase trials completed submit new drug application nda  in mid exenatide lar type diabetes phase evaluation initiate phase study in first quarter of ac glp late stage congestive heart failure phase evaluation submit investigational new drug application ind  in second half of initiate additional phase study second half of ac pramlintide acetate obesity phase evaluation phase study initiated in first quarter of report phase results in second half of ac atherosclerosis phase evaluation phase evaluation ongoing ac pyy obesity preclinical evaluation ind filed with fda in late initiate phase study in first quarter of report phase results in second half of from inception through  we devoted substantially all of our research and development efforts to symlin 
beginning in  the composition of our research and development costs started to include costs for our other drug candidates  primarily exenatide and exenatide lar 
our recent research and development efforts are focused on our late stage diabetes products  symlin and exenatide  however we are building a pipeline by leveraging our experience with metabolic diseases to include programs targeted for obesity and cardiovascular disease 
the drug development process  from discovery through regulatory approval  takes on average years according to recent industry reports 
the process includes several steps defined by the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda  which allows for the initiation of the clinical evaluation in humans of a potential drug candidate 
clinical evaluation is typically comprised of three phases of study  phase  phase and phase generally  the majority of a drug candidate s total development costs are incurred during phase  as these trials are typically the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
successful completion of phase clinical testing is followed by the submission of an nda to the fda for marketing approval 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of an nda  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
following initial regulatory approval for a drug candidate  we anticipate initiating additional clinical studies aimed at expanding product labels and market potential 
the timing and costs to complete the successful development of any of our drug candidates are highly uncertain  and therefore difficult to estimate 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our development programs  please refer to the risk factors related to our business section of item i above 
our research and development expenses are comprised of salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and a portion of our facilities costs 
we charge direct internal and external program costs to the respective development programs 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs because such costs benefit multiple development programs and allow us to increase our pharmaceutical development capabilities 
these consist primarily of facilities costs and other internal shared resources related to the development and maintenance of systems and processes applicable to all of our programs 
the following table provides information regarding our research and development expenses for our major projects in millions year ended december  exenatide symlin early stage programs and research unallocated exenatide exenatide  the first in a new class of drugs called incretin mimetics  is a drug candidate for the treatment of type diabetes 
we are developing exenatide  including both twice daily and sustained release formulations  with lilly to improve glucose control in patients with type diabetes who are not achieving target levels with diet  exercise and metformin  a sulfonylurea or a combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea 
we completed our pivotal phase clinical trials of exenatide in the fourth quarter of we believe the results of these studies are sufficient to form the basis of an nda for exenatide  which is planned for submission to the fda in mid our planned development efforts for our exenatide development program include the continuation of ongoing open label clinical trials  the continuation of manufacturing scale up and the completion of the nda 
other trials planned for include studies to support regulatory filings outside of the united states and studies to increase our understanding of exenatide s potential in the united states and other markets 
we are also studying a sustained release formulation of exenatide  or exenatide lar  which is currently in a phase program 
we believe that exenatide s glucose dependent mechanism of action  in addition to its potency and long half life presents a unique opportunity for a sustained release formulation 
in early  we intend to initiate a phase dose proportionality study of exenatide using a target formulation that might allow once a week to a once a month administration of exenatide 
this sustained release formulation of exenatide is being developed in collaboration with lilly and alkermes 
the timing of material net cash inflows from our exenatide and exenatide lar development programs are dependent upon regulatory approvals  and subsequent market acceptance 
symlin symlin is a synthetic version of human amylin  a hormone co secreted with insulin by the beta cells in the pancreas 
we are studying symlin for the treatment of patients with type diabetes and insulin using patients with type diabetes 
other than insulin and insulin analogues  symlin is the first potential treatment addressing glucose control for patients with type diabetes that has completed phase clinical trials since the discovery of insulin approximately years ago 
in may  we completed a symlin dose titration study in patients with type diabetes 
data from the dose titration study formed the basis of an amendment to our symlin nda  which was submitted to the fda in june we are currently conducting two open label studies 
the first is an extension of the dose titration study and the second is an open label study initiated during to study the use of symlin in type and type patients in a standard endocrine diabetes specialist practice setting 
in december  we received a second approvable letter for symlin from the fda 
the fda requested additional clinical data to identify a patient population and method of use for symlin where there is no increased risk of significant hypoglycemia or where there is an added benefit that clearly counterbalances any potential for increases in episodes of hypoglycemia 
discussions with the fda are under way with a goal to clarify the specific requirements to obtain fda approval for symlin 
until these requirements are known  our research and development efforts for symlin will be limited to specific activities related to our interactions with the fda and continuation of the ongoing open label clinical trials discussed above 
the timing of material net cash inflows from symlin is dependent upon regulatory approvals and subsequent market acceptance 
early stage programs and research in addition to our late stage diabetes development programs  we are also studying compounds for the treatment of obesity and cardiovascular disease 
we have two compounds in our development pipeline for the treatment of obesity 
we initiated a phase study of ac pramlintide acetate for the treatment of obesity in the first quarter of we submitted an ind for our second obesity drug candidate  ac pyy  in december of and plan to begin a phase study in early we also have two drug candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
ac glp is in a phase program for the treatment of severe congestive heart failure 
this program was acquired in early we plan to submit an ind for ac and initiate a phase study in the second half of ac is our drug candidate for the treatment of atherosclerosis related cardiovascular disease and is in a phase program 
we are evaluating strategic opportunities for this drug candidate 
our internal research efforts continue to be focused on the discovery of additional peptides for the treatment of diseases 
results of operations revenues under collaborative agreements we had revenues under collaborative agreements of million in compared to million in and no such revenues in the revenues recorded in these periods consist solely of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration with lilly for exenatide  entered into in september revenues under collaborative agreements include the amortization of a portion of the million of up front payments received from lilly  recognition of a portion of the milestone payments received from lilly in december  amounts paid or payable by lilly to equalize exenatide development expenses  and amounts earned for the co promotion of humatrope 
the following table summarizes the components of revenues under collaborative agreements for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  amortization of up front payment recognition of milestone payment cost sharing and co promotion payments in september  lilly made an million non refundable payment to us  and we agreed to incur the first million of development costs following the date of the agreement 
accordingly  we recorded of the first million of us development costs for exenatide  whether incurred by us or by lilly  and we recorded as revenue approximately of these development costs through an amortization of million of the up front payment  which amortization was completed during the third quarter of the remaining million is being amortized to revenues ratably over a year period 
during the third quarter of  we reached the million level of cumulative exenatide development costs 
subsequently  lilly is responsible to fund  on an ongoing basis  of development costs in the united states and of development costs outside of the united states 
while we continue to lead exenatide development efforts in the united states  lilly is also directly incurring exenatide development expenses and makes cost sharing payments to us to equalize development costs  which are recorded as revenues under collaborative agreements in the period in which the related development expenses are incurred 
in addition to the up front payment and ongoing cost sharing payments discussed above  lilly agreed to make future milestone payments of up to million to us upon the achievement of certain development milestones related to both the twice daily and sustained release formulations of exenatide 
in december  following successful completion of our pivotal phase clinical trials for exenatide  we received a milestone payment of million from lilly 
of this amount  million was recorded as revenues under collaborative agreements and the remaining million was deferred  as it is potentially creditable against future milestones 
the majority of future development milestones relate to events in the exenatide lar development program  and we may receive up to million of future commercial milestones contingent upon the launch of the twice daily and sustained release formulations of exenatide in the united states and selected territories throughout the world 
we also recorded a small amount as revenues under collaborative agreements in for amounts earned for our co promotion of humatrope 
we recorded no such revenues in or in future periods  revenues under collaborative agreements will consist of ongoing cost sharing payments from lilly to equalize development costs  possible future milestone payments and the continued amortization of the million portion of the up front payment 
the amount of cost sharing revenue recorded will be dependent on the timing  extent and relative proportion of total development costs for the exenatide development programs incurred by us and by lilly 
the receipt and recognition as revenue of future milestone payments is subject to the achievement of performance requirements underlying such milestone payments and  for certain development milestones  the expiration of stock conversion rights associated with such payments 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our research and development expenses increased significantly on a year over year basis in both and the million increase in research and development expenses in compared to primarily reflects increased costs of million associated with our exenatide development program  including costs to complete the pivotal phase clinical trials  costs for open label extensions of these trials and costs associated with manufacturing scale up 
we also incurred increased costs of million for symlin  primarily costs associated with the completion of the dose titration study  ongoing open label clinical trials and the development of a pen delivery platform 
in addition  we incurred increased costs of million associated with our research activities and our earlier stage development programs  primarily ac and ac the million increase in research and development expenses in compared to reflects  almost exclusively  increased costs of million associated with our exenatide development program  including costs associated with the pivotal phase clinical trials and manufacturing scale up  and to a lesser extent  increased symlin costs of million associated with clinical trials that formed the basis of our nda amendment in june acquired in process research and development we recorded an expense of million in for acquired in process research and development related to the acquisition of our ac development program 
this compound is in early phase development  and no alternative future use was identified 
additional development and regulatory activities are required and product launch  if approved  is not expected in the near term 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in the years ended december   and respectively 
the million increase in  compared to is due primarily to costs associated with the continued investment in our commercial and business support organizations to support future product launches  as well as increased facilities costs required to support our growth 
the expansion of our commercial organization includes the addition of a person sales force  increased medical education activities for smylin  and growth in our managed care and other sales support functions 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to reflects primarily an increase in pre launch expenses for symlin and to a lesser extent  an increase in our number of employees and other business support costs 
other income and expense interest and other income consists primarily of interest income from investment of cash and investments 
interest and other income was million in  million in  and million in the increase in compared to reflects a million gain on early retirement of debt at a discount and higher average reserves available for investment 
the decrease in compared to primarily reflects declining market interest rates in as compared to interest and other expense consists primarily of interest expense resulting from long term debt obligations 
in we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes with a coupon rate of 
during  we repaid our outstanding indebtedness to johnson johnson incurred pursuant to the terms of an earlier collaboration agreement 
the interest expense attributable to the debt to johnson johnson through the date of repayment was a non cash expense  consisting of accrued interest added to the principal balance and the amortization of a debt discount 
interest expense in future periods will consist of interest on the convertible senior notes and the amortization of associated debt issuance costs 
interest and other expense was million in  million in and million in net loss our net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the increase in the net loss in compared to reflects the increased operating expenses  partially offset by the increases in revenues from collaborative agreement and interest and other income  discussed above 
the increase in the net loss in compared to reflects the increased operating expenses and the reduction in interest and other income  partially offset by the increase in revenues from collaborative agreement discussed above 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next few years due to ongoing expenses associated with the continuation and potential expansion of our research and development programs  exenatide  exenatide lar  and our earlier stage development programs  the planned commercialization of symlin and exenatide and related general and administrative support 
operating losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of expenses incurred and revenues recognized 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of common stock and preferred stock  debt financings  payments received pursuant to our exenatide collaboration with lilly and reimbursement of symlin development expenses through earlier collaboration agreements 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at december  the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in reflects million provided by our financing activities  partially offset by amounts used to fund our operations during the significant financing activities include million in net proceeds from a public offering of common stock in january  million in net proceeds received from a private placement of convertible senior notes in june and july  and the repayment of our indebtedness to johnson johnson of million 
we expect to use between and million of cash to fund our operating activities during this spending level assumes net cost sharing payments from lilly to equalize exenatide development and pre launch costs 
we do not expect to receive significant milestone payments from lilly in symlin activities planned for will be focused primarily on ongoing open label clinical studies and continued discussions with the fda to clarify the requirements for symlin approval 
this also assumes the maintenance of our commercial capabilities and continued progress with our earlier stage development programs 
we do not expect to generate positive operating cash flows for at least the next few years 
in december  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the sec  which allows us to sell up to million of various securities in one or more offerings in the future 
the terms of any offering will be established at the time of sale 
the sec declared this registration statement effective in february we also have a loan facility with lilly that  subject to certain defined development and regulatory events  over time could provide us up to million to fund a portion of our development and commercialization costs for exenatide 
at the end of  a small portion of this facility was available to us and we expect more to become available in any loans under this facility would be secured by some of our patents and other tangible assets and  at lilly s option  are convertible into our common stock if amounts remain outstanding for more than two years 
while we are not currently contemplating a specific source of financing  we expect that we will need to raise additional funds from outside sources to continue our research and development activities  fund operating expenses  establish manufacturing sources and inventory  pursue regulatory approvals and build sales and marketing capabilities as necessary 
the sources of outside funding available to us include public and or private offerings of common or preferred stock  debt or other securities  amounts available to us under our lilly loan facility  and revenues and expense reimbursements from collaborative agreements for one or more of our drug candidates 
the level at which we seek additional funding  the source of such funding  and the timing of any action is dependent on many factors  including but not limited to  the development status of our drug candidates  the timing of potential regulatory approvals for symlin and exenatide and prevailing market conditions 
we used cash of million  million and million from our operating activities in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our operating activities in and reflect payments received from lilly of a million milestone payment and an million up front payment  respectively 
our investing activities used million  million and provided million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
investing activities in all three years consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments  but also included purchases of laboratory and office equipment and patent additions 
financing activities provided million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts consisted primarily of proceeds from sales of common stock and the issuance of convertible senior notes  partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
during  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due june  in a private placement generating net proceeds of million 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to million shares of our common stock at per share 
under certain circumstances  the notes are redeemable in whole or in part  at our option  on or after june   at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and maturity dates as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total excludes interest payments  payable in cash semi annually  of million per year 
excludes long term obligation of million related to deferred compensation  the payment of which is subject to elections made by participants that are subject to change 
in addition  under certain license and collaboration agreements with other companies we are required to pay royalties and or milestone payments upon the successful development and commercialization of related products 
at december   we are committed to purchase approximately million of symlin inventory in the subsequent twelve month period 
if fda approval for symlin is received  our expenditures to secure commercial grade bulk drug material will increase substantially  including a commitment to purchase approximately million of additional material pursuant to an agreement with johnson johnson 
we are also obligated to purchase this material if we enter into a collaboration agreement for symlin or if there is a change in control of amylin 
if none of these events occur  we have no obligation to purchase this material from johnson johnson 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for symlin and exenatide  whether regulatory approvals for the marketing of symlin and exenatide are received  our ability to receive milestone payments pursuant to our exenatide collaboration with lilly  our ability and the extent to which we establish commercialization arrangements for symlin  our ability to progress with other ongoing and new clinical and preclinical trials and the extent of these trials  scientific progress in our other research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing or defending ourselves against patents  competing technological and market developments  changes in or new collaborative relationships  and any costs of manufacturing scale up 
since august  we have been subject to an ongoing class action lawsuit filed by certain shareholders in the united states district court for the southern district of california against us  our chairman and former chief executive officer and one director  alleging violations of the federal securities laws related to declines in our stock price 
the complaint alleges securities fraud in connection with various statements and alleged omissions to the public and to the securities markets 
we believe that the lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend ourselves and our officers and directors vigorously against the claims  although no assurance can be given that we will be successful in defending such claims 
if we are not successful in our defense of this lawsuit  we may be required to make significant payments to our stockholders 
the lawsuit is at an early stage and the extent or range of possible damages  if any  cannot yet be reasonably estimated 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory costs and patent costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our consolidated financial statements on page f 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
amounts received for upfront product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  and the expiration of stock conversion rights  if any  associated with such payments 
amounts received for equalization of development expenses are recognized in the period in which the related expenses are incurred 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
inventory we capitalize inventory costs associated with certain drug candidates prior to receipt of regulatory approval  based on management s judgment of probable future commercialization 
we would be required to expense these capitalized costs upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other factors  a decision denying approval of the drug candidate by regulatory agencies 
at december   gross capitalized inventory  all of which relates to symlin  totaled million 
additionally  at december   we are committed to purchase million of symlin inventory in the subsequent twelve month period 
our ability to recover the value of this inventory is dependent upon our ability to obtain regulatory approvals to market symlin in the united states and or other markets 
additionally  approximately million of the million of symlin inventory is in finished dosage form  the majority of which was manufactured in late our nda suggests that the finished inventory would have a thirty six month expiration period 
we evaluate the recoverability of our finished inventory in consideration of our expected regulatory timelines and estimated sales volumes 
in december  we received a second approvable letter from the fda for symlin 
as a result  our planned launch of symlin was delayed 
accordingly  we have a valuation reserve of million at december  related to our finished symlin inventory  of which million was provided for in income taxes we have net deferred tax assets relating primarily to net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
subject to certain limitations  these deferred tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods 
since we have been unprofitable since inception and the likelihood of future profitability is not assured  we have fully reserved for these deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
if we determine that we are able to realize a portion or all of these deferred tax assets in the future  we will record an adjustment to increase their recorded value and a corresponding adjustment to increase income in that same period 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
differences between actual clinical trial costs from estimated clinical trial costs have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in us government securities  asset backed securities and debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations with strong credit ratings 
these instruments have various short term maturities 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments held are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive investments 
our debt is not subject to significant swings in valuation as interest rates on our debt are fixed 
the fair value of our senior convertible notes approximates their carrying value 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
