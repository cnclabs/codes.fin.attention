item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary steiner leisure limited is a leading worldwide provider of spa services 
we sell our services and products to cruise passengers and at luxury resort and day spas primarily in the united states  the caribbean  the pacific  asia and mexico 
payments to cruise lines  resort spa owners and day spa landlords are based on a percentage of our revenues and  in certain cases  a minimum annual rental or a combination of both 
in  we completed the disposition of our discontinued day spa operations  leaving us with our two elemis flagship luxury day spas one in london  england and one in coral gables  florida 
a significant factor in our financial results are the amounts we are required to pay under our agreements with the cruise lines 
certain cruise line agreements provide for increases in percentages of revenues payable over the terms of those agreements 
these payments may also be increased under new agreements with cruise lines and land based lessors that replace expiring agreements 
in general  we have experienced increases in these payments as a percentage of revenues upon entering into new agreements with cruise lines 
an increasing amount of revenues have come from our third party retail product sales 
we distribute these products through mail order  our web sites  third party retail outlets and other channels 
we also offer post secondary degree and non degree programs in massage therapy  skin care and related areas at our schools in florida comprised of four campuses and our two schools comprised of a total of three campuses in maryland  pennsylvania and virginia 
since our revenues are generated primarily from our cruise ship and resort spa operations  our success depends to a significant extent on the success of the cruise line and resort industries 
over the past three years  the cruise line and resort industries have experienced certain declines as a result of various factors impacting the demand for vacations including  among other things  fears of terrorist attacks  such as those of september   and potential and actual armed hostilities in iraq and elsewhere  recessionary economic conditions worldwide  outbreaks of illnesses on ships and in countries where we operate resort spas as well as the adverse publicity surrounding these and other events 
in addition  increased competition for cruise ship passengers resulting from increased passengers capacities among the large cruise lines  accentuated by the foregoing factors  have caused cruise lines to discount fares in order to increase passenger counts 
passengers who are cruising sole ly due to these discounts may reflect their cost consciousness by not spending on discretionary items  such as our products and services 
the foregoing factors adversely affected our earnings in  and although it is not possible to identify the precise financial impact on us of each of these factors  these occurrences adversely impacted the travel and leisure industry in general  and the cruise and resort industries and us in particular 
in the second half of  however  our results improved following the end of formal hostilities in iraq and the absence of significant illness outbreaks aboard ships or in countries where our resort spas are located 
it is not possible to state with certainty what caused the improved results  and the cruise industry continued to offer discount ticket prices during that six month period 
we believe that a more stable international political climate as well as the absence of publicized mass illnesses affecting ships or resorts venues would lead to better results for the cruise line and resort industries in we also believe that improved results for those industries could result in improved results for us 
a significant portion of our operations are conducted on ships through entities that are not subject to income taxation 
historically  a significant amount of our income has not been subject to tax in the united states or other jurisdictions 
to the extent that our non shipboard revenues increase as a percentage of our overall revenues  the amount of our income that will be subject to tax would increase 
key performance indicators cruise industry operations 
a measure of performance we have used in connection with our periodic financial disclosure relating to our cruise line operations is that of revenue per staff per day 
in using that measure we have differentiated between our revenue per staff per day on ships with large spas and other ships we serve 
our revenue per staff per day has been affected by the increasing requirements of cruise lines that we place additional non revenue producing staff on ships with large spas to help maintain a high quality guest experience 
we also utilize  as measures of performance for our cruise line operations  our average revenue per week and our revenue per passenger per day 
resort spas 
with respect to our resort spas we measure our results primarily through average weekly revenue over applicable periods of time 
schools 
with respect to the performance of our massage therapy schools  we measure performance by the number of new student enrollments 
a new student enrollment occurs each time a new student commences classes at one of our schools 
products 
with respect to sales of our products other than on cruise ships and at our resort and day spas  we measure performance by revenues 
growth we seek to grow our business by attempting to obtain contracts for new cruise ships brought into service by our existing cruise line customers and other cruise lines and by seeking new venues for our resort spas 
we also consider growth through appropriate strategic transactions  including acquisitions and joint ventures  as well as through seeking additional channels for the distribution of our retail products 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact on our business operations and any associated risks related to these policies is discussed below under results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  beginning on page f our preparation of this form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  d isclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
cost of revenues includes cost of services  including an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard and land based spa employees  payments to cruise lines and land based spa lessors and other staff related shipboard expenses  spa facilities depreciation  as well as  with respect to our schools  directly attributable campus costs such as rent and employee wages  and cost of products  including an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard and land based spa employees  payments to cruise lines and land based spa lessors and other staff related shipboard expenses  as well as costs associated with development  manufacturing and distribution of products 
cost of revenues may be affected by  among other things  sales mix  production levels  exchange rates  changes in supplier prices and discounts  purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies  tariffs  duties  freight and inventory costs  increases in commissions payable over the term of cruise line agreements and increased amounts payable under new agreements with cruise lines and land based lessors that replace expiring agreements 
cost of products includes the cost of products sold through our various methods of distribution 
to a lesser extent  cost of products also includes the cost of products consumed in rendering services 
this amount would not be a material component of the cost of services rendered and would not be practicable to identify separately 
operating expenses include administrative expenses  salary and payroll taxes 
in addition  operating expenses include amortization of intangibles relating to our acquisitions of resort spas in property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets in question 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
for certain properties  leasehold improvements are amortized over the lease term which includes renewal periods that may be obtained at our option  that are considered significant to the continuation of our operations and to the existence of leasehold improvements the value of which would be impaired by our discontinuing use of the leased property 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset  industry practice and asset maintenance policies 
maintenance and repai r items are expensed as incurred 
goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  business combinations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 business combinations and sfas  accounting for pre acquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
all business combinations in the scope of sfas are to be accounted for under the purchase method 
sfas was effective july  our acquisitions of the mandara spa and greenhouse and c 
spa day spa chains were accounted for under the provisions of sfas the adoption of sfas with respect to acquisitions made prior to july  did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
all intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  and assigned values in connection with pre july  acquisitions meet the recognition criteria specified by sfas and  therefore  wil l continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  on january  we had recorded approximately  of amortization on these amounts for the year ended december  and would have recorded approximately  of amortization during the same period in and in lieu of amortization for and  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill and an annual impairment review thereafter 
during the second quarter of  we completed our assessment of our intangible assets and wrote off million of intangible assets 
those intangibles primarily consisted of goodwill related to our july acquisitions of the greenhouse and c 
spa day spa chains 
the write off has been accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and has been recorded effective january  we performed the required impairment tests as of january  and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
additionally  on january   the company performed the required annual impairment test and determined there was no impairment 
as of december   we had unamortized goodwill and intangibles of million 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves our estimating our actual current tax exposure together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards on january   steiner leisure adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas also amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
sfas provides more guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test  requires that a long lived asset or asset group  principally consisting of property  plant and equipment  to be disposed of other than by sale eg  abandoned be classified as held a nd used until it is disposed of  requires revision of the depreciable life of a long lived asset to be abandoned and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset or asset group as held for sale 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report beginning on page f for discussion of impairment losses recognized in in july  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf relates to sfas no 
s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by fasb in this statement is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that mee ts the definition of a liability 
therefore  sfas no eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the effective date of the sfas no 
is january   with earlier adoption encouraged 
in connection with the discontinued operations  steiner leisure early adopted sfas no 
in the effects of this adoption are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report beginning on page f in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities on interpretation of arb no 
fin  to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
in december  the fasb issued fin r to clarify certain provisions of fin and to modify the effective date of such provisions for public companies 
until now  a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a variable interest entity  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the expected losses as defined from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
based on the revised guidance  all public companies must apply the provisions of fin r to variable interests commonly referred to as special purpose entities an spe  where such interests were created prior to february   no later than periods ending after december  interests created in non spe variable interest entities after january  but before december  are subject to the provisions of the original fin in  but the provisions of fin r must be adopted no later than the first reporting period ending after march  the provisions of fin r must be applied to all variable interests created after december  upon initial involvement with the variable interest entity 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  certain selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended december  revenues services products total revenues cost of revenues cost of services cost of products total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses administrative salary and payroll taxes amortization of goodwill total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest expense other income total other income expense income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes  minority interest and equity investment provision for income taxes income from continuing operations before minority interest and equity investment minority interest and equity investment income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of taxes net income loss compared to revenues 
revenues increased approximately  or million  to million in from million in of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in services revenues and million was attributable to an increase in products revenues 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an average of seven additional spa ships in service in compared to the increase was also attributable to the improved performance of our land based spas in compared to  which reflected significantly greater impact from the terrorist attacks of september  we had an average of  shipboard staff members in service in compared to an average of  shipboard staff members in service in revenues per shipboard staff per day decreased by to in from in this decrease is attributable to an increase in the percentage of our shipboard staff represented by fitness instructors  who gener ate less revenues than other shipboard service providers  and by other non revenue generating staff 
in general  as spa ships make up an increasing percentage of the ships we serve  we expect such decreases to continue since on spa ships we utilize a greater percentage of these types of staff 
cost of services 
cost of services increased million from million in to million in cost of services as a percentage of services revenue increased to in from in these increases were due to increases in commissions allocable on cruise ships covered by agreements that provided for increases in commissions in compared to additionally  the increases were attributable to flat revenues at our massage therapy schools and a decrease in revenues at our spas in asia in due to decreases in tourism resulting from the sars illness  the aftermath of the bali  indonesia terrorist bombing and the war in iraq  in each case accompanied by an increase in fixed costs 
also  we incurred start up costs relating to the opening of our elemis day spa in coral gables  florida and relating to the opening of our mandara spa at the one only palmilla resort in los cabos  mexico in february cost of products 
cost of products increased million from million in to million in cost of products as a percentage of products revenue increased to in from in this increase was due to increases in commissions allocable to products sales on cruise ships covered by agreements which provide for increases in commissions in compared to operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million from million in to million in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in these increases were primarily attributable to the cost of additional personnel in the product manufacturing  product distribution  staff training and information technology areas in as compared to  start up costs related to the launch of our new business of distributing our products in the united states to third party day spas and costs incurred in connection with the implementation of our new inventory procurement system 
this was partially offset by a reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts at our massage therapy schools 
other income expense 
other income expense decreased million from expense of million in to expense of million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest expense as a result of a reduction in the outstanding principal amount of our term loan and the receipt of  of business interruption insurance proceeds 
these proceeds relate to damages incurred by some of our mandara resort spa properties as a result of a typhoon in guam in december provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes remained constant at million in and the provision for income taxes decreased to an overall effective rate of for from an overall effective rate of for primarily due to the income earned in jurisdictions that do not tax our income being greater than our income earned in jurisdictions that tax our income 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
the loss from discontinued operations decreased million from million in to million in this decrease was attributed to a million loss on disposal that was recorded in the fourth quarter of with respect to the disposition of most of our day spa operations which commenced in that quarter and a million loss from operations attributable to a full year of operations of those day spas in  compared to a million loss from discontinued operations in  which included the impact of only of those day spas ten of which were disposed of during the first quarter of and four of which were sold effective april  
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during the second quarter of  in accordance with sfas  we wrote off million in intangible assets 
these intangibles primarily consist of goodwill related to our july acquisitions of the greenhouse day spa and c 
spa chains 
the write off has been accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and has been recorded effective january  compared to revenues 
revenues increased approximately  or million  to million in from million in of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in services revenues and million was attributable to an increase in products revenues 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the land based operations we acquired in the third quarter of and to an average of nine additional spa ships in service in compared to the increase was also attributable to the significant decrease in travel in the weeks following the terrorists attacks of september   which abated to a significant extent in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues at our massage therapy schools due to lower enrollments 
we had an average of  shipboard staff members in service in compared to an average of  shipboard staff members in service in revenues per shipboard staff per day increase d by to in from in cost of services 
cost of services increased million from million in to million in cost of services as a percentage of services revenue increased to in from in these increases were due to increases in costs incurred in connection with our acquired operations and commissions allocable on cruise ships covered by agreements that provided for increases in commissions in compared to additionally  the increases were attributable to a decrease in revenues at our massage therapy schools in that did not affect increases in fixed costs at the schools 
cost of products 
cost of products increased million from million in to million in cost of products as a percentage of products revenue decreased to in from in this decrease was due to increased efficiency at our manufacturing facility that was partially offset by increases in commissions allocable to products sales on cruise ships covered by agreements which provide for increases in commissions in compared to operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million from million in to million in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in the decrease was due to a decrease in goodwill amortization as the result of the impact of a new accounting principle and the effect of the relatively small administrative overhead relating to the land based operations that were acquired in the third quarter of the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts at the massage therapy schools  the results of which were exacerbated by the weak economic conditions and an increase in intangible amortization of our land based operations that were acquired in the third quarter of other income expense 
other income expense increased million from expense of million in to expense of million in this increase was due to the increase in interest expense in as a result of our debt financing obligations  under the credit agreement which we entered into in connection with our july acquisitions  which was not in place during all of  and a reduction in interest income due to reduced cash balances in provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased million from million in to million in the provision for income taxes increased to an overall effective rate of for from an overall effective rate of for primarily due to the income earned in jurisdictions that tax our income increasing to a greater extent than our income earned in jurisdictions that do not tax our income and a tax benefit that was recorded in for a refund for taxes paid in prior years that did not occur in loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
the loss from discontinued operations increased million from million in to million in this increase was attributed to a million loss on disposal that was recorded in the fourth quarter of with respect to the disposition of most of our day spa operations which commenced in that quarter and a million loss from operations attributable to a full year of operations of those day spas in  compared to a partial year in as a result of the acquisition of the day spas in the third quarter of cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during the second quarter  in accordance with sfas  we wrote off million in intangible assets 
these intangibles primarily consist of goodwill related to our july acquisitions of the greenhouse day spa and c 
spa chains 
the write off has been accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and has been recorded effective january  quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data on a quarterly basis for and and the percentage of revenues represented by the line items presented 
certain cruise lines  and  as a result  steiner leisure  have experienced varying degrees of seasonality  generally resulting in the third quarter being the strongest quarter for us 
in addition  our resort spas third and fourth quarter results typically are their strongest as a result of the seasonality of a number of the resorts they serve 
the quarterly selected statements of operations data set forth below were derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of steiner leisure excludes the day spa segment  which is reported in discontinued operations which  in the opinion of our management  contain all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of those statements

additionally  the net increase in accounts receivable and inventories was lower in as both and include a full year of post acquisition results 
during the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million compared with million for the year ended december  we have incurred costs to improve our information technology systems and to build spas at various properties in both and steiner leisure had working capital of approximately million at december   compared to working capital of approximately  at december  in october  our premier resort spa division  mandara spa  entered into agreements to develop and operate luxury spa facilities at the one only palmilla  a resort in los cabos  mexico  and at the westin rio mar beach resort in puerto rico 
the build out of the palmilla spa has cost million and we estimate that the westin build out will cost approximately million 
the palmilla spa opened in february and we estimate that the westin spa will open by october we funded the palmilla build out  and anticipate funding the westin build out  from working capital 
in connection with the construction of the atlantis spa  we spent million in and million in these million in capital expenditures were to be amortized over the fifteen year term of our arrangement with the atlantis resort 
effective january   the operator of the atlantis resort exercised its option to buy out the remaining term of our lease and  as a result  effective january  we no longer offered our services and products at the atlantis spa 
in connection with that buy out we received million from the operator of the atlantis resort and did not recognize any gain or loss 
commencing in july  with our acquisition of a interest in mandara spa  we began again to offer products and services at the atlantis spa 
in october  steiner leisure entered into an agreement to build and operate a luxury spa facility at the aladdin resort and casino in las vegas  nevada 
that luxury spa opened in november the term of the lease of the facility is years with a five year renewal option if certain sales levels are achieved 
the build out of the luxury spa cost approximately million 
the build out was funded from our working capital and a term loan 
the operator of the aladdin resort and casino has filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
that resort continues to conduct its operations and we have taken steps in the bankruptcy court to protect our leasehold interest at the resort 
while the purchase of the aladdin by a group that includes  among others  starwood hotels and resorts  has been approved by the bankruptcy court  certain approvals have not yet been obtained and we cannot assure you that our operations at the aladdin resort and casino will not be adversel y affected by aladdin s bankruptcy filing 
in july  we purchased a equity interest in each of mandara spa llc and mandara spa asia limited collectively referred to as mandara spa 
effective march   we acquired an additional approximately interest in mandara spa llc for consideration of approximately million in cash 
this amount represented the funding that was required to complete the build out of certain luxury spa facilities under the mandara name 
effective december   we acquired the remaining interests in mandara spa llc and mandara spa asia in exchange for a total of  of our common shares  valued at approximately million 
mandara spa operates spas in locations worldwide  principally in asia and the pacific  the united states and the caribbean 
mandara spa also provides spa services for silversea  norwegian and orient cruise lines 
in connection with the july mandara spa acquisition  we paid million in cash including million in transaction costs  million in subordinated debt  million in common shares and assumed million of subordinated indebtedness and the selling equity holders guaranteed certain income levels for an month period 
if the income levels were not achieved  then  amounts owed on the subordinated debt would be reduced on a pro rata basis 
we issued to the selling equity holders subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of  which have an interest rate of per annum and a maturity date of january  the notes 
the notes are subordinate in right of payment to steiner s senior credit facility 
interest on the million of the notes issued to the former shareholders of mandara spa asia the mandara asia notes accrues  and is payable  quarterly 
interest on the million of the notes issued to the former members of mandara spa the mandara us notes accrues quarterly  but is payable on the maturity date 
amounts due under the notes both principal and interest must be earned by mandara spa llc and or mandara asia limited  as applicable  by generating income in the post acquisition period 
interest on the mandara us notes is not payable until the end of the earnout period 
hence  if not earned  no interest or principal will be due on these notes 
interest on the mandara asia notes accrues  and is payable  quarterly 
however  if mandara spa asia limited fails to meet the earnout threshold  all interest payments previously paid to the former shareholders of mandara spa asia limited are required to be repaid to steiner by such former shareholders 
because principal and interest due under the mandara us notes  and the repayment of principal of the mandara asia notes is not payable until after the settlement of the earnout contingency  and if the earnout were not met  the notes are cancelable and any interest payments previ ously paid to the former shareholders of mandara spa asia limited will be repaid to us 
we have not recorded any purchase price goodwill related to the notes 
as of december   in connection with the earnout  approximately million in principal representing a reduction in the original principal amount and  of interest was due under the mandara us notes and million in principal and  of interest was due under the mandara asia notes 
in we finalized the earnout and  as a result  increased the mandara us notes by approximately  in accordance with sfas  these amounts have been recorded as a component of the purchase price of mandara spa 
in connection with our acquisition of mandara spa we incurred approximately million in costs from july through march relating to the completion of the build out of certain luxury spa facilities operating under the mandara name 
in july  we purchased the assets of the greenhouse day spa chain and other related entities  which assets  collectively  constituted eleven luxury day spas located at various locations within the united states  and the greenhouse mark 
in connection with that transaction  we paid million in cash and million in common shares 
in addition  million of common shares  and  options in common shares could be earned by the sellers if certain income levels were obtained through in july  we purchased the shares of dk partners  inc  which operated six day spas located in california 
in connection with that transaction  we paid million in cash and assumed million of indebtedness 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to dispose of  or otherwise close  of those day spas 
the remaining day spa is located at a hotel and is continuing to operate as part of our resort spa operations 
in that quarter  we began negotiations with potential third party acquirers of the assets of those day spas as well as with landlords at the shopping centers and other venues where those day spas are located 
as of april   all of those day spas had been closed or otherwise disposed of pursuant to agreements with landlords and or  in some cases  agreements with third party acquirers of the spas assets  including the leases 
these transactions involved our paying to those landlords amounts representing various portions of the remaining terms of the leases involved 
in the transactions involving transfers of spa assets and assignments of the leases  we typically were required to make payments to those acquirers in consideration of their assuming both the lease in question and certain gift certificate liabilities related to the spas in question 
the lease assignments to third parties generally do not include a release from the landlords of the spas in question and  accordingly  to the extent that these third parties fail to pay rent under the leases  we would remain liable for that rent 
we would  in those instances  have a cause of action for such rental amounts against those third parties 
the total amount that we remain liable for under such assigned leases  if the assignees fail to make the payments that they are required to make  is approximately million 
our loss on disposal in connection with these discontinued operations was approximately million in and million in our loss on operations in connection with these discontinued operations is approximately million for and million in in addition  in connection with these discontinued operations  celeste dunn  the former president and chief executive officer of our steiner day spas  inc subsidiary  terminated her employment with us 
in connection with that termination  ms 
dunn received a severance payment of  and options to purchase  of our common shares 
these transactions were accounted for under the purchase method 
financing activities in order to finance these acquisitions  in july  we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a term loan of million and a revolving credit facility of up to million 
in the first quarter of  the credit agreement was amended to permit us to forego making a portion of the principal payments under the term loan during that quarter 
those principal payments were amortized over the remainder of the term of that loan  which comes due in july as a result  we have been  and will be  required to make greater principal payments than would otherwise have been the case had the principal payments for the first quarter of not been postponed 
in december we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement 
the terms and conditions of the new agreement are substantially the same as the former agreement except that the maturity date of the revolving loan is extended one year to july  borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and bear interest primarily at london interbank offered rate libor based rates plus a spread that is dependent upon our financial performance 
borrowings under the term loan were used to fund acquisitions and under the revolving facility have been used for working capital needs 
as of february   million was outstanding under the term loan and approximately million was outstanding under the revolving facility 
at february   the effective rates on the term loan and revolving facility were approximately and  respectively 
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative  negative and financial covenants  including limitations on dividends  capital expenditures and funded debt  and requirements to maintain prescribed interest expense and fixed charge coverage ratios 
as of december  and february   we were in compliance with these covenants 
other limitations on capital expenditures  or on other operational matters  could apply in the future 
effective september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to market risks from changing interest rates 
under the swap agreement  we agree to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional principal amount 
any differences paid or received on interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense over the life of each swap  thereby adjusting the effective interest rate on the underlying obligation 
we do not hold or issue such financial instruments for trading purposes 
derivatives used for hedging purposes must be designated as  and effective as  a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract 
the interest rate swap has a notional amount of million as of december  and matures on july  the interest rate swap agreement effectively converts a portion of our libor based variable rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings with a pay rate of 
we recorded gains losses of   and  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in  and  respectively 
we reclassified losses of   and  related to the interest rate swap into interest expense in  and  respectively 
in  we purchased a total of approximately million of our common shares in the open market 
the cash used to make such purchases was funded from our working capital 
these purchases were made pursuant to a share purchase program authorized by our board of directors 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payment due by period in thousands total less than one year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt minimum line commissions operating leases employment agreements spa build outs discontinued operations total these amounts represent guaranteed minimum payments committed pursuant to cruise line agreements 
included herein are the minimum guaranteed payment obligations under certain of our resort spa leases 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
we believe that cash generated from operations is sufficient to satisfy the cash required to operate our current business for the next months 
to the extent there is a significant slow down in travel resulting from terrorist attacks  the war in iraq  other hostilities  or any other reasons  cash generated from operations may not satisfy the cash required to operate our business 
in that case we would need outside financing which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
inflation and economic conditions steiner leisure does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on revenues or results of operations 
however  public demand for activities  including cruises  is influenced by general economic conditions  including inflation 
periods of economic recession or high inflation  particularly in north america where a substantial number of cruise passengers reside  could have a material adverse effect on the cruise industry upon which we are dependent 
the recent softness of the economy in north america and over capacity in the cruise industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements from time to time  including in this report and in the documents incorporated into this report by reference  steiner leisure may publish forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements reflect our current views about future events and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements include statements regarding our proposed activities pursuant to agreements with cruise lines or land based operators  our future land based activities  our ability to secure renewals of agreements with cruise lines upon their expiration  scheduled introductions of new ships by cruise lines  our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  the extent of the taxability of our income  the effects of acquisitions and new projects  our market sensitive financial instruments  our future financial results  and our ability to increase sales of our products 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements include the following our dependence on cruise line concession agreements of specified terms that are  in some cases  terminable by cruise lines with limited or no advance notice under certain circumstances  our dependence on the cruise industry and the resort industry and our being subject to the risks of those industries  including operation of facilities in countries with histories of economic and or political instability  increasing numbers of days during cruises when ships are in port  which results in lower revenues to us  reductions in revenues during periods of major renovations or closures of resorts where we operate spas  economic downturns that could reduce the number of customers on cruise ships and at resorts and that could otherwise reduce consumer demand for our products and services and the continuing effect on the economy in general and the travel and leisure segment in particular of the events of september   the hostilities in iraq  the bombings in indonesia in october and august and the threat of future terrorist attacks and armed hostilities  our dependence on a limited number of companies in the cruise industry and further consolidation of companies in the cruise industry  our obligation to make minimum payments to certain cruise lines and lessors of land based spas  irrespective of the revenues received by us from customers  increases in our payments accompanying renewals of expiring cruise line agreements and land based spa agreements  or the securing of new agreements  our dependence on the continued viability of the cruise lines we serve and the resorts where we operate our land based spas  delays in new ship introductions  a reduction in new spa ship introductions and unscheduled withdrawals from service of ships we serve  the effects of outbreaks of illnesses  such as sars  or the perceived risk of such outbreaks  on our resort spa operations in asia and in other locations  as well as on our cruise ship operations  our dependence for success on our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel  our dependence on a single product manufacturer  changes in the taxation of our bahamas subsidiaries and increased amounts of our income being subject to taxation  changing competitive conditions  including increased competition from cruise lines that desire to provide spa services themselves and competition from third party providers of shipboard spa services  our limited experience in land based operations including with respect to the integration of acquired businesses  risks relating to our non us operations  possible labor unrest or changes in economics based on collective bargaining activities  uncertainties beyond our control that could affect our ability to timely and cost effectively construct land based spa facilities  our need to seek additional financing and the risk that such refinancing may not be available on satisfactory terms  or at all  changes in laws and government regulations applicable to us and the cruise industry  product liability or other claims against us by customers of our products or services  restrictions imposed on us as a result of our credit facility  and currency risk 
these risks and other risks are detailed in the section of this report entitled certain factors that may affect future operating results 
that section contains important cautionary statements and a discussion of many of the factors that could materially affect the accuracy of our forward looking statements and or adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial position 
forward looking statements should not be relied upon as predictions of actual results 
subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law  we expressly disclaim any obligation to disseminate  after the date of this report  any updates or revisions to any such forward looking statements to reflect any change in expectations or events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statements are based 
certain factors that may affect future operating results in addition to the other information set forth  or incorporated by reference in this report  you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating steiner leisure and its business 
we depend on our agreements with cruise lines and resorts  if these agreements terminate  our business would be harmed our revenues are generated principally from our cruise ship spa operations 
under our agreements with cruise lines  we provide services and products paid for by cruise passengers 
the cruise line agreements have specific terms  ranging from one to six years with an average remaining term per ship of approximately one and one half years as of february  as of that date  cruise line agreements that expired within one year covered of the ships served by us 
these ships accounted for approximately of our revenues 
we cannot assure you that any of these agreements will be renewed after their expiration date or that any renewal will be on similar terms 
also  we cannot assure you that upon renewal  these agreements will not cause reductions in our margins 
we typically are able to begin negotiations to renew agreements that are set to expire approximately six months prior to their expiration dates 
in addition  these agreements provide for termination by the cruise lines with limited or no advance notice under certain circumstances  including  among other things  the withdrawal of a vessel from the cruise trade  the sale or lease of a vessel or our failure to achieve specified passenger service standards 
as of february   agreements for four ships provided for termination for any reason by the cruise line on days notice and  with respect to one ship  our agreement terminated on march  these five ships which are included in the ships referenced above accounted for approximately of our revenues in the year ended december  our cruise line agreements may  therefore  be terminated prior to their specified termination dates 
termination of significant cruise line agreements  or a series of other cruise line agreements  either upon completion of their terms or prior thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
some of our land based agreements also provide for termination with limited advance notice under certain circumstances  including a failure to meet specified performance standards 
in addition  negotiations with cruise lines or resort operators may result in agreements which may not be as beneficial to us as anticipated  or non renewals of agreements 
we depend on the cruise industry and their risks are risks to us our revenues are generated principally from cruise ship passengers 
therefore  the ability of the cruise industry to attract passengers is critical to our results of operations and financial condition 
according to the cruise lines industry association  the passenger volume of cruises marketed primarily to north american consumers increased from approximately million passengers in to approximately million passengers in however  the cruise industry may not continue to grow or may decrease in size in the future 
a decrease in passenger volume could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the cruise industry is subject to significant risks that could affect our results of operations 
accidents and other incidents involving cruise ships and other unscheduled withdrawals of ships from service  delays in new ship introductions  environmental violations by cruise lines  restricted access of cruise ships to environmentally sensitive regions and possible increases in fuel costs could materially adversely impact the cruise industry 
a number of cruise ships have experienced outbreaks of illnesses that have affected  at times  hundreds of passengers on a ship 
the public concern over these incidents  especially if they continue  or other negative publicity about the cruise industry  could adversely affect the cruise industry and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  industry analysts have expressed concern regarding potential over capacity of ships operated by the cruise lines 
such overcapacity could adversely affect the cruise industry a nd adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  recently  several cruise lines have been discounting their fares in order to increase their passenger counts 
passengers who are cruising solely due to these discounts may reflect their cost consciousness by not spending on discretionary items  such as our services and products 
part of the reason for our growth in revenues over recent years has been the introduction of new ships with large spa facilities 
in the next few years  the rate of introduction of these new ships will decrease 
this could adversely affect the rate of growth  if any  in revenues from our cruise ship operations 
the cruise lines operate in waters and call on ports throughout the world  including geographic regions that from time to time experience political and civil unrest and armed hostilities 
historically  such events have adversely affected demand for cruise vacations 
severe weather conditions  both at sea and at ports of embarkation  also could adversely affect the cruise industry 
the cruise industry also relies to a significant extent on airlines to transport passengers to ports of embarkation 
fears of terrorist attacks  such as those of september   and potential and actual armed hostilities such as in iraq  may cause prospective travelers to cancel their plans  including plans for cruise vacations 
in addition  any strikes or other disruptions of airline service  including of the type that followed the terrorist attacks of september  and those that could follow other terrorist attacks or armed hostilities  could adversely affect the ability of cruise passengers to reach their ports of embarkation 
cruise ships have increasingly had itineraries which provide for the ships to be in port during cruises 
when cruise ships are in port  our revenues are adversely affected 
cruise lines compete for consumer disposable leisure time dollars with other vacation alternatives such as land based resort hotels and sightseeing vacations 
in addition  public demand for vacation activities is influenced by general economic conditions 
a majority of the cruise passengers we serve reside in north america 
an economic downturn in north america  such as was recently experienced  as well as future periods of general economic recession  could have a material adverse effect on the cruise industry and could also have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the aftermath of the september  and other hostilities may adversely impact our financial results and growth both steiner leisure and the leisure industry in general have been adversely affected in the aftermath of the september  terrorist attacks on new york and washington and the hostilities in iraq 
in addition  our resort spa operations in indonesia and malaysia were adversely affected by the terrorist bombings in bali  indonesia in october and are continuing to be adversely affected by those and other terrorist attacks  including the hotel bombing in jakarta  indonesia in august domestic and international leisure travel and resort occupancy  which already had been adversely affected by the economic downturn in the united states and internationally  have decreased further and are likely to remain depressed over the near term as potential travelers reduce or avoid discretionary air and other travel in light of the increased safety concerns and anticipated travel delays 
those attacks  the threat of additional attacks and of armed hostilities inte rnationally or locally also have decreased consumer confidence  and a resulting further decline in the us and global economies could further reduce travel 
at present  it is not possible to predict either the severity or duration of such declines  but weaker cruise industry and resort performance could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on certain cruise lines  and the loss of a significant cruise line customer could harm us as a result of the consolidation of the cruise industry  the number of independent cruise lines has decreased in the past few years 
in the second half of  premier and commodore cruise lines ceased to operate 
in september  renaissance cruise line ceased its operations 
in the last few years  the parent company of carnival cruise line has acquired a number of other cruise lines and further consolidation of the cruise industry may occur 
as a result of industry consolidation  a small number of cruise lines  all of whom currently are our customers  dominate the cruise industry 
revenues from passengers of each of the following cruise companies accounted for more than ten percent of our revenues in  and  respectively carnival including carnival  costa  cunard  holland america  p o european ferries  princess  seabourn and windstar cruise lines  and  and royal caribbean including royal caribbean and celebrity cruise lines  and 
the carnival percentages are calculated as if princess and p o european ferries had been acquired by carnival effective january   in fact that acquisition was effective in january these companies also accounted for of the ships served by us as of february  if we cease to serve one of these cruise companies  or a substantial number of ships operated by a cruise company  it could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are required to make minimum payments under our agreements and face increasing payments to cruise lines and resort operators steiner leisure is obligated to make minimum payments to certain cruise lines and resort operators regardless of the amount of revenues we receive from customers 
we may also be required to make such minimum annual payments under any future cruise line or land based spa agreements we enter into with resort owners or others 
accordingly  we could be obligated to pay more in minimum payments than the amount we collect from customers 
as of december   these payments are required by cruise line agreements covering a total of ships served by us and two additional ships not yet in service 
as of december   steiner leisure guaranteed total minimum payments to cruise lines excluding payments based on minimum passenger per diems applicable to certain ships served by us of approximately million in and million in these amounts could increase under new or renewed agreements 
some of the minimum annual payments are calculated based upon minimum passenger per diems for passengers actually embarked on each cruise of the respective vessel 
these payments could significantly increase the minimum payments above 
in general  steiner leisure has experienced increases in required payments to cruise lines upon renewing  or entering into  new agreements with cruise lines 
as of december   steiner leisure guaranteed total minimum payments to resorts of approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
these amounts could increase under new or renewed agreements 
we depend on the continued viability of the ships and resorts we serve our revenues from our shipboard guests and guests at our land based resorts can only be generated if the ships and resorts we serve continue to operate 
premier  commodore and renaissance cruise lines ceased operating in and the aladdin resort and casino  where we began operating a luxury spa in december  has filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws 
the aladdin resort continues to operate and we have taken legal steps to protect our interest as the operator of the spa at that resort 
while the purchase of the aladdin by a group that includes  among others  starwood hotels resorts has been approved by the bankruptcy court  certain approvals have not yet been obtained and  accordingly  we cannot assure you of the continued viability of the aladdin resort and casino including our ability to protect our substantial investment in our build out there or of any of the other cruise lines or resorts that we serve 
to the extent that cr uise lines or resorts that we serve  or could potentially serve in the future  cease to operate  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected 
delays in new ship introductions and reduction in new spa ships could harm us our growth depends  in part  on our serving new cruise ships brought into service 
a number of cruise lines we serve have experienced in the past  and continue to experience  delays in bringing new ships into service 
in addition  there are a limited number of shipyards in the world capable of constructing large cruise ships in accordance with the standards of major cruise lines 
this may also contribute to delays in new ship construction 
such delays could have a material  adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  in recent years cruise lines have increasingly introduced larger ships with larger and enhanced facilities where we offer our services and products 
our operations on those ships have generated more revenues than on other cruise ships 
in the next few years the number of these types of ships being introduced will decrease 
this could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our key officers and qualified employees our continued success depends to a significant extent on our senior executive officers  including clive e 
warshaw  chairman of the board  leonard i 
fluxman  president and chief executive officer  and glenn j 
fusfield  chief operating officer 
in addition  as a result of our limited experience with land based spa operations  the success of our land based spas depends to a significant extent on the senior officers who run those operations 
the loss of services of any of these persons or other key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have key person life insurance policies with respect to messrs 
fluxman and fusfield and one other executive officer  but not mr 
warshaw or any of our other executive officers 
one important tool for attracting and retaining key steiner leisure management personnel and other employees of our company is the issuance of stock options or other equity incentives to such employees 
only a limited number of shares are currently available for grants to employees under our stock option and incentive plan 
recently  it has become more difficult than in the past for companies to obtain the needed shareholder approval to make additional shares available for option grants or other equity grants to employees 
to the extent we are unable to amend our option plan to make available more shares for grants to management and other key employees  our ability to attract and retain key employees could be materially  adversely affected 
our continued success is also dependent on our ability to recruit and retain personnel qualified to perform our shipboard and land based services 
shipboard employees typically are employed pursuant to agreements with terms of eight months 
land based spa employees are generally employed on an at will basis 
other providers of shipboard spa services have been competing with us for shipboard personnel 
we also compete with spas and other employers for land based personnel 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to attract a sufficient number of applicants possessing the requisite skills necessary for our business 
if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified applicants to provide our services and products  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected 
we depend on a single product manufacturer almost all of the ingredients and other materials for our elemis and la therapie beauty products are produced by a single manufacturer  pursuant to an agreement that expired in december we are currently negotiating a new agreement with this manufacturer  and are continuing to purchase its products 
however  until any such new agreement is finalized  this manufacturer is not contractually obligated to continue its relationship with us 
if this manufacturer ceased producing  for any reason  these ingredients and other materials for our products  the transition to other manufacturers could result in significant production delays 
any significant delay or disruption in the supply of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales 
possible adverse changes in the taxation of steiner leisure background steiner leisure is a bahamas international business company ibc that  directly or indirectly  owns  among other entities steiner transocean limited  our principal subsidiary and a bahamas ibc that conducts our shipboard operations  and steiner management services llc  a florida limited liability company that performs administrative services in connection with our operations in exchange for fees from steiner transocean and other subsidiaries management services 
steiner leisure also owns  directly or indirectly  the shares of additional subsidiaries in the united states  the united kingdom and other taxable jurisdictions as well as subsidiaries in jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries are not subject to tax 
steiner leisure and its bahamas ibc subsidiaries are not subject to bahamas or other income tax  except as set forth below 
steiner leisure s united states subsidiaries are subject to us income tax as a consolidated group at regular corporate rates up to 
generally  any dividends paid by our united states holding company to its parent  steiner leisure  would be subject to a us withholding tax 
steiner leisure believes that none of its other income will be effectively connected with our deemed conduct of business in the united states and  accordingly  that our remaining income will not be subject to united states federal income tax 
steiner transocean is a bahamas ibc and is not subject to bahamas tax 
a foreign corporation generally is subject to united states federal corporate income tax at a rate of up to on its united states source income and on certain of its foreign source income that is effectively connected to a business it conducts in the united states 
a foreign corporation can also be subject to a branch profits tax of imposed on its after tax earnings 
we believe that almost all of steiner transocean s income will be foreign source income  not effectively connected to a business it conducts in the united states 
this belief is based on the following factors almost all of steiner transocean s shipboard spa and salon services are being performed outside the united states and its possessions and their respective territorial waters  passage of title and transfer of ownership of almost all beauty products sold by steiner transocean takes place outside the united states  and the activities performed on behalf of steiner transocean in the united states are not a material factor in generating income for steiner transocean 
the risks to us however  all or a portion of steiner transocean s income could be subject to united states federal income tax at a rate of up to to the extent the first two activities described above were considered by the united states internal revenue service to occur in the united states  its possessions or territorial waters  if regulation or legislation is enacted that changes the way the irs views the taxability of our operations  or if the activities performed on behalf of steiner transocean in the united states were considered to be a material factor in generating steiner transocean s income 
if steiner transocean is subject to united states federal income tax at a rate of up to on its united states source income and on certain of its foreign source income that is effectively connected to a business it conducts in the united states  it would also be subject to a branch profits tax of imposed on its after tax earnings subject to united states federal income tax that are withdrawn  or considered to be withdrawn  from its united states business 
for similar reasons  certain non us jurisdictions may also assert that steiner transaction s income is subject to their income tax 
management services receives payments from steiner transocean and other subsidiaries of steiner leisure in return for certain administrative services it provides to steiner transocean and those subsidiaries 
the irs may assert that transactions between management services and steiner transocean and between our other direct and indirect subsidiaries do not contain arms length terms 
in that event  income or deductions could be reallocated among the subsidiaries in a manner that could increase the taxable income of management services 
this reallocation also could result in the imposition of interest and penalties 
management services and other us subsidiaries of ours also may be subject to additional us state and local income  franchise and other taxes 
some of our united kingdom and united states subsidiaries provide goods and or services to steiner leisure and certain of our other subsidiaries 
the united kingdom inland revenue  or united states internal revenue service authorities may assert that some or all of these transactions do not contain arms length terms 
in that event  income or deductions could be reallocated among our subsidiaries in a manner that could increase the uk or us tax on us 
this reallocation also could result in the imposition of interest and penalties 
we cannot assure you that the tax laws that we have relied on to minimize our income taxes will remain unchanged in the future 
in january  the irs proposed regulations that  if adopted  could possibly subject a portion of our shipboard income to us federal income tax 
in  steiner leisure paid tax at an aggregate rate of on its income 
the increase in our land based operations since has significantly increased  and is expected in the future to continue to increase  the amount of our non shipboard revenue 
this could result in a significant increase in the amount of our income that is subject to taxation 
in addition  such amount of income subject to tax will increase to the extent our land based income is increased relative to our shipboard income 
we face competition on ships and on land we compete with passenger activity alternatives on cruise ships and with competing providers of services and products similar to ours seeking agreements with cruise lines 
gambling casinos  bars and a variety of shops are found on almost all of the ships served by us 
in addition  ships dock in ports which provide opportunities for additional shopping as well as other activities that compete with us for passenger attention and dollars 
cruise ships also typically offer swimming pools and other recreational facilities and activities  as well as musical and other entertainment  all without additional charge to the passengers 
one cruise line we serve has announced its intention to provide shipboard spa services and products with its own personnel on two of its ships and another cruise line we serve has engaged the services of another third party spa provider for one of its new ships 
additional cruise lines could take similar actions in the future 
there are several o ther entities offering services in the cruise industry similar to those provided by us  including harding brothers  canyon ranch and other providers 
many of the resorts that we serve or may serve in the future offer recreational entertainment facilities and activities similar to those offered on cruise ships  often without additional charge to guests 
a number of these resorts also offer casino gambling 
our day spas compete with other day spa chains and individual day spas which have operations in the vicinities of our day spas  as well as with other beauty  relaxation or other therapeutic alternatives 
these include  with respect to hair and manicure and pedicure services  large  well known national chains and independently owned salons that offer these services at prices significantly lower than those charged by us 
we believe  however  that the prices charged by us are appropriate for the quality of the experience we provide to our customers 
in addition  steiner leisure is relatively new to the land based spa industry and our spas compete with spas and beauty salons owned or operated by companies that have offered land based spa s ervices longer than we have and which may enjoy greater name recognition with customers and prospective customers  than the land based spas operated by us 
in addition  a number of these spa operators may have greater resources than we do 
the post secondary education market is highly competitive 
our massage therapy schools compete with providers of similar instruction in the states in which they are located and elsewhere in the united states  including many providers with greater resources than ours 
our schools face competition from  among others  traditional public and private two year and four year colleges and universities and other proprietary schools  including those that offer distance learning programs 
some public institutions are able to charge lower tuition than our schools  due in part to government subsidies  government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions and other financial sources not available to proprietary schools such as ours 
the recent slow down in the technology sector is causing a number of our competitors who have traditionally offered instruction relating to that sector to modify their course offerings 
a number of those schools are now offering or contemplating offering programs si milar to ours 
this will increase the competition for students 
a number of these other schools have greater resources than we do 
our land based product sales compete with a variety of other brands  including those of manufacturers with greater resources than ours  and products with greater name recognition than our products  including large entities with greater resources than ours 
our land based operations face additional risks we have limited experience in land based operations in july  we made a series of acquisitions which resulted in our being the operators of the greenhouse  mandara and c 
spa land based spa chains 
in and  we acquired three massage therapy schools currently composed of a total of seven campuses located in florida and several mid atlantic states 
as a result of these acquisitions and other recent land based activities  and despite the disposition in the fourth quarter of and in early of most of our day spa operations  an increased portion of our business is now represented by land based operations 
in the future  we may decide to grow our business through other land based acquisitions that we deem appropriate 
prior to the acquisitions described above  our business almost entirely consisted of providing spa services and products on cruise ships and we had only limited experience with respect to land based operations 
our day spa operations did not prove to be beneficial to our overall result s of operations  and we may not be able otherwise to duplicate any success we have had with our shipboard operations in our land based operations 
in order to successfully conduct our land based businesses  we must effectively and efficiently integrate the businesses we have acquired 
if we are unable to successfully integrate our land based spa operations  or any other land based operations we may acquire in the future  our business and financial results could be materially  adversely affected 
the success of our land based businesses also depends on our ability to hire and retain the services of qualified personnel 
we cannot assure you that a sufficient number of highly qualified personnel will be available to us 
risks relating to our discontinued day spa operations during the last quarter of and the first four months of  we disposed of day spas  constituting most of our day spa operations 
our loss on disposal of these discontinued operations was approximately million for our loss on operations in connection with these discontinued operations was approximately million for for  the loss on disposal and loss on discontinued operations was approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
in addition  most of the agreements under which we have closed or otherwise disposed of the day spas required us to pay rent for various periods of time after the date we ceased to operate the spas involved 
also  in connection with most of the agreements relating to the disposition of day spas to third parties  we remain liable under the leases for those day spas in the event the third party lease assignees fail to pay rent under such leases 
the total amount that we remain l iable for under such assigned leases  if the assignees fail to make the payments that they are required to make is approximately million 
risks of non us operations a total of of our non united states resort spa operations are located in indonesia  thailand and malaysia 
the indonesian island of bali  where we have a number of resort spas  was the site of a terrorist attack in october jakarta  the indonesian capital  was the site of a hotel bombing in august those attacks have caused our revenues in that region to decline in and compared to and revenues are expected to remain below levels for the foreseeable future 
in addition  countries where we currently or may in the future operate spas have in the past  and may in the future experience adverse developments in the political and economic environment  varying governmental regulations  foreign currency fluctuations and potential adverse tax consequences 
such adverse developments  among other things  could prevent us from adequately supervising these operations and could materially adversely affect the financial performance of these oper ations 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
certain locations in asia where we operate our spas lack a local workforce with adequate training 
bringing in trained spa employees from elsewhere is sometimes difficult due to applicable immigration rules 
we also operate spas in the caribbean  the pacific  mexico and other locations that are subject to severe weather conditions  including hurricanes and other destructive storms 
in the fourth quarter of  guam  where we operate several resort spas  was hit by a significant typhoon 
that typhoon resulted in damage to our properties and the closing of the resorts in which they were located  causing us to suffer a loss of revenues 
similar storms or other destructive natural occurrences affecting the areas in which we have operations could materially  adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our resort spas depend on the resort hotel industry we operate luxury spas at resorts located in countries and territories 
we are dependent on the resort hotel industry for the success of our resort spas 
to the extent that consumers do not choose to stay at resorts where we operate spas  as to which we have no control  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially  adversely affected 
the hotel resort industry is subject to risks that are  in many ways  similar to that of the cruise industry  including the following risks changes in the national  regional and local economic climate including major national or international events such as the terrorist attacks of september   the october bali terrorist attack  the august jakarta terrorist attack and the hostilities in iraq  local conditions  including an oversupply of hotel properties  or a reduction in demand for hotel rooms  the attractiveness of the hotels to consumers and competition from comparable hotels  the outbreak of illnesses  such as sars  asian flu or the perceived risk of such outbreaks  in locations where we operate resort spas  the performance of the employees at the resorts we serve  possible labor unrest or changes in economics based on collective bargaining activities we anticipate that all our non management employees in the bahamas  and certain of our non management employees in mexico will be subject to collective bargaining agreements in the near future  changes in room rates at the resorts we serve  the viability of resorts we serve  reductions in resort occupancy resulting from major renovations  damage or other causes the aladdin resort has scheduled a major renovation which will adversely affect the financial position and results of operations of our spa there during the time such renovation takes place  the maintenance of the resorts we serve and changes in popular travel patterns  and acquisition by hotel chains of spa service providers to create captive in house brands and development by hotel chains of their own proprietary spa service providers  reducing the opportunity for third party spa providers 
to the extent that there are adverse changes in the foregoing conditions  this could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial conditions 
risks relating to our schools in august  we acquired a post secondary school comprised of four campuses in florida offering degree and non degree programs in massage therapy  skin care and related areas 
in april  we acquired two massage therapy schools currently comprised of a total of three campuses in maryland  virginia and pennsylvania 
we had no prior experience in operations of this type and we cannot assure you that these businesses will perform as we anticipate 
if we are unable to successfully operate these schools  or any other non spa related operations that we may acquire in the future  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected 
in the fourth quarter of  we appointed a new senior executive in our schools division 
while we believe that this new senior executive has the qualifications to successfully lead that division  she has had limited experience in her new capacity and we cannot assure you that she  in fact  will be able to successfully manage our school operations or increase their profitability 
in addition  in january  we terminated operations at our campus in winchester  virginia and we cannot assure you that we will continue to operate all of the remaining campuses for any specified period of time 
to date  only a limited number of graduates of our schools have ended up being employed by us 
we may have insufficient liquidity to take advantage of some available opportunities among other parts of our business plan  we consider land based opportunities to operate spas at resorts 
we have been required in connection with obtaining a number of resort spa leases to incur the cost of the build out of the spa facilities 
we have drawn down all available funds under the revolving credit portion of our credit facility and we are subject to restrictions on capital expenditures under our credit facility 
other limitations on capital expenditures  or on other operational matters  could apply in the future 
also  the amendment to our credit facility provided us with partial relief with respect to principal payments for the first quarter of the result of that relief is that we will be required to use a portion of our cash flow to make interest payments with respect to that unpaid principal 
additionally  our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to enable us to build out the facilities at resorts where we otherwise would like to operate spas 
therefore  we may not be able to take advantage of all otherwise favorable opportunities to operate resort spas 
generally  as long as we have certain bank loans outstanding  if we exceed our currently anticipated capital expenditures or our cash flow from operations is less than anticipated  we would need to seek concessions from our lender and or additional equity or debt financing to fund our business plan 
among other things that could cause our cash flow to be less than anticipated is the reduction in leisure travel that could result from the continued hostilities in iraq and or the continued perpetration or threats of terrorist attacks 
additional financing  including a new credit facility  may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
risks relating to build out of land based spas in connection with our agreements relating to our spas at the atlantis resort and casino  the ocean club  the aladdin resort and casino  the hilton hawaiian village resort  the mohegan sun resort  the one only palmilla resort and the westin rio mar resort  we were required to build out the spa facilities we operate at our own expense 
in connection with any other new land based resort spas that we may seek to operate in the future  we may wish  or be required  to build out the spa s facilities at our own expense 
the cost proposed cost  with respect to the westin spa to build out these large facilities has ranged from million to approximately million 
in addition  we have been required to expend amounts none more than  on the build outs of certain of our resort spas 
any land based spas we might wish to operate in the future could require build out expenditures within that range or above it  and we cannot assure you that we would ha ve available sufficient resources to take advantage of any such opportunity 
such build outs involve risks to us  including as follows the commencement of the build outs generally cannot begin until the venue owner has completed its own construction site around the premises of the proposed spa 
we have no control over that process 
the build out process  as well as weather related postponements and other factors affecting construction projects generally  could delay our spa s opening date and result in a loss of revenue to us 
if the resort owner files for bankruptcy or otherwise has financial problems prior to opening of the spa  the spa may never commence operations 
we may lose substantial funds expended on the build out to that point if we lose our rights to build out and or operate that spa as a result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding 
for example  the operator of the aladdin resort and casino  where we lease facilities and operate a luxury spa  has filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code and continues to conduct its operations 
we built out this luxury spa facility at a cost of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that our operations at the aladdin resort and casino will not be adversely affected by aladdin s bankruptcy filing 
government regulation could adversely affect us products our advertising and product labeling practices in the united states are subject to regulation by the federal trade commission and the food and drug administration  as well as various other federal  state and local regulatory authorities 
the contents of our products that are sold in the united states are subject to regulation in the united states 
we are subject to similar regulation under the laws of the united kingdom and certain european union laws 
federal  state and local regulations in the united states and non united states jurisdictions  including increasing regulation by the european union  designed to protect consumers or the environment could increase the cost of  or otherwise materially adversely affect  the advertising  manufacturing and packaging of our products 
land based spas our land based spa operations are subject to applicable regulations in the locations where such operations are conducted 
these regulations could adversely affect our ability to sell  or could increase the cost of  our services and products 
among other things  local immigration laws could impede our ability to obtain work permits needed for employees at our land based facilities 
schools our massage therapy schools are subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies 
in particular  these operations are subject to the requirements of the higher education act hea and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the department of education doe 
our schools must satisfy certain criteria in order to participate in various financial assistance programs under title iv of the hea 
any regulatory violation could be the basis for the initiation of a suspension  limitation or termination of the eligibility of steiner leisure or any of its schools to participate in such programs 
under the applicable regulations  there are three financial ratios for an institution  each of which is scored separately and which is then combined to determine the institution s financial responsibility 
if an institution s composite score is below the minimum requirement for unconditional approval but above a designated threshold level  such institution may take advantage of an alternative that allows it to continue to participate in the title iv programs for up to three years under additional monitoring procedures 
if an institution s composite score falls below this threshold level or is between the minimum for unconditional approval and the threshold for more than three consecutive years  the institution will be required to post a letter of credit in favor of the doe 
in order to operate and award degrees  diplomas and certificates and to participate in the title iv programs  a campus must be licensed or authorized to offer its programs by the appropriate state s department of education 
additionally  each institution must be accredited by an agency recognized by the doe 
all of our schools are eligible for our students to receive federal funding  including loan funds 
the financial aid and assistance programs  in which most of our schools students participate are subject to political and budgetary considerations 
there is no assurance that such funding will be maintained at current levels 
administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies 
failure by our schools to comply with applicable federal  state or accrediting agency requirements could result in the limitation  suspension or termination of the ability to participate in title iv programs or the loss of the state licensure or accreditation 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  title iv program funds would have a material adverse effect on the steiner leisure s revenues and cash flows because the schools student enrollment would likely decline significantly as a result of our students inability to finance their education without the availability of title iv program funds 
product liability and other potential claims could adversely affect us the nature and use of our products and services could give rise to product liability or other claims if a customer were injured while receiving one of our services or suffered adverse reactions following the use of our products 
adverse reactions could be caused by various factors beyond our control  including hypoallergenic sensitivity and the possibility of malicious tampering with our products 
if any of these events occurred  we could incur substantial litigation expense  receive adverse publicity and suffer a loss of sales  and  therefore  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected 
our credit facility financing could restrict our activities in december  we entered into a credit facility with a bank that provides for a term loan of million and a revolving facility of up to million  which amended our prior credit facility 
that agreement contains certain affirmative  negative and financial covenants  that could restrict us from taking actions which our management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of steiner leisure and its shareholders 
additionally  our ability to comply with these covenants could be affected by events beyond our control  and we may not be able to meet these covenants 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit facility 
upon the occurrence of such a default the outstanding principal  together with all accrued interest under our credit facility will  at the option of our lenders  become immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay amounts that become due under the credit facility  our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as security under our credit facility 
if the indebtedness under the credit facility were to be accelerated  our lender could take actions that could materially adversely affect our business and operations 
need for growth in product sales in order for us to grow  we need to find additional sources of revenue 
one possible area of growth for steiner leisure is additional emphasis on growth in sales of our products  particularly our elemis and la therapie lines 
while we believe that our elemis luxury day spas in coral gables  florida and london  england will assist us in our efforts to increase our elemis and la therapie products sales  we cannot assure you that these spas will have significant positive effects on such distribution efforts because  among other things  those spas are the only day spas in their respective countries operated under the elemis name  or that we otherwise will be able to grow our product sales 
we are not a united states company and  as a result  there are special risks our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum of association and articles of association  which are similar to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of a united states corporation  and the international business companies act  of the bahamas the ibc act 
there are very few reported judicial cases under the ibc act 
accordingly  the rights and remedies of our public shareholders in the face of actions by our management  directors or shareholders are less clearly established than would be the case with a company incorporated in the united kingdom or a united states jurisdiction 
certain of our directors and executive officers reside outside the united states 
a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of those persons are located outside the united states 
as a result  it may not be possible to effect service of process within the united states upon such persons 
it also may not be possible to enforce against them or steiner leisure judgments obtained in united states courts based on the civil liability provisions of the united states federal securities laws 
in the opinion of harry b 
sands  lobosky and company  our bahamas counsel it is unlikely that bahamian courts would entertain original actions against bahamas companies or their directors or officers based solely upon united states federal securities laws  judgments predicated upon any civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws are not directly enforceable in the bahamas  rather  a lawsuit must be brought in the bahamas on any such judgment  and in general  a judgment obtained after due trial by a court of competent jurisdiction  which is final and conclusive as to the issues in contention  is actionable in bahamian courts and is impeachable only upon the grounds of fraud  public policy and natural justice 
currency risk because we pay for the administration of recruitment and training of our shipboard personnel and the manufacturing of raw material and of our products in english pounds sterling and euros  the weakness of the us dollar against those currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 
recently  the us dollar has been weak against the pounds sterling and euro and a continuation of this weakness could materially  adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
anti takeover provisions limit shareholders ability to effect a change in management or control our articles of association include certain provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a future takeover or change in control of steiner leisure that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests 
among other things  our articles provide for a classified board of directors serving staggered terms of three years  super majority voting requirements with respect to certain significant transactions and restrictions on certain transactions with holders of or more of the voting shares of steiner leisure 
we have an authorized class of  preferred shares that may be issued in one or more series by the board of directors without further action by the shareholders on such terms and with such rights  preferences and designations as the board of directors may determine 
furthermore  our amended and restated share option and incentive plan and certain of our employment agreements provide certain rights to plan participants and our officers in the event of a change in control of steiner leisure 
in addition  certain of our cruise line agreements provide the cruise lines with rights of termination in the event of certain changes in control 
our stock price has fluctuated and could fluctuate significantly since our common shares have commenced being publicly traded  the market price of our shares has fluctuated over a wide range and may continue to do so in the future 
the market price of our common shares could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors and events  including  among other things the depth and liquidity of the trading market for our common shares  quarterly variations in our actual or anticipated operating results  changes in recommendations or estimates of our earnings or cruise industry earnings by analysts  market conditions in the travel  leisure and cruise industries  announcements or activities by our competitors  and general economic or market conditions 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies including as a result of significant national events such as the terrorist attacks of september  and their aftermath and the hostilities in iraq 
furthermore  our operating results and prospects form time to time may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
any such event could result in a material decline in the price of our common shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk steiner leisure s major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives based upon market conditions 
our objective in managing the exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  we use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes to its borrowings 
these swaps are entered into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby reducing the risk of credit loss 
the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and weighted average interest rates associated with our existing long term debt instruments  assuming our actual level of indebtedness thereafter in thousands long term debt term loan million  variable rate at december  revolving loan  variable rate at december  fixed rate note payable fixed rate subordinated notes effective september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce its exposure to market risks from changing interest rates 
under the swap agreement  we agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional principal amount 
any differences paid or received on interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense over the life of each swap  thereby adjusting the effective interest rate on the underlying obligation 
we do not hold or issue such financial instruments for trading purposes 
derivatives used for hedging purposes must be designated as  and effective as  a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract 
for every one percent increase in the applicable interest rate  our total interest expense would increase by approximately the interest rate swap has a notional amount of million as of december  and matures on july  the interest rate swap agreement effectively converts a portion of our libor based variable rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings with a pay rate of 
we recorded gains losses of   and  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in  and  respectively 
we reclassified losses of   and  related to the interest rate swap into interest expense in  and  respectively
