item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjuction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview pennsylvania real estate investment trust  a pennsylvania business trust founded in and one of the first equity reits in the united states  has a primary investment focus on retail shopping malls and power centers located in the eastern united states 
the retail properties have a total of approximately million square feet  of which we and our joint venture partners own approximately square feet 
our portfolio currently consists of properties in states and includes shopping malls  strip and power centers and four industrial properties 
we hold our interests in our portfolio of properties through our operating partnership  preit associates  lp we are the sole general partner of preit associates and  as of december   held a controlling interest in preit associates 
we consolidate preit associates for financial reporting purposes 
we hold our investments in nine of the properties in our portfolio through joint ventures with third parties 
eight of these joint ventures are classified as unconsolidated and one is consolidated 
we hold a non controlling interest in each unconsolidated joint venture  and account for them using the equity method of accounting 
under this accounting method  rather than consolidating the results of the unconsolidated joint ventures with our results  we instead record the earnings from the unconsolidated joint ventures under the income statement caption entitled equity in income of partnerships and joint ventures 
changes in our investment in these entities are recorded in the balance sheet caption entitled investment in and advances to partnerships and joint ventures  at equity 
for further information regarding our joint ventures  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we provide our management  leasing and development services through preit services  llc  which develops and manages our wholly owned properties  and preit rubin  inc pri  which develops and manages properties that we own interests in through joint ventures with third parties and properties that are owned by third parties in which we do not have an interest 
of our eight unconsolidated joint ventures  we manage one of the properties and other parties in some cases our joint venture partners manage the remaining seven properties 
one of our key strategic long term objectives is to obtain managerial control of all of our assets 
in furtherance of this objective  we reduced the total number of properties that we hold in unconsolidated joint venture form from properties as of december  to eight properties as of december  although we intend to continue to pursue this objective  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in the future 
in  we transformed our strategic focus to the retail sector by completing the following transactions o merged with crown american realty trust  which owned shopping malls and a interest in palmer park mall in easton  pennsylvania through a pre existing joint venture with us  o acquired six shopping malls in the philadelphia area from the rouse company  o acquired our partner s share in willow grove park  willow grove  pennsylvania  o acquired a acre parcel adjacent to plymouth meeting mall  plymouth meeting  pennsylvania  o disposed of our property multifamily portfolio  o issued  common shares through a public offering  o completed a million unsecured revolving line of credit  and o completed mortgage financing transactions on dartmouth mall  dartmouth  massachusetts  and moorestown mall  moorestown  new jersey 
due to the acquisitions listed above  management has devoted  and expects to continue to devote  significant attention to integrating the newly acquired properties with our existing operations 
our merger with crown poses particular challenges because it requires the integration of two large and complex real estate companies that formerly operated independently 
we expect these integration activities to impact our day to day operations and  unless our integration efforts are successful  we may be unable to realize some of the expected benefits of these acquisitions 
in addition  we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  significant expenses with respect to our integration activities for consulting  compensation and other services 
as a result of the completion of our merger with crown and other acquisition activities  we recognized expenses of million through december   and as a result of the merger we expect to incur additional expenses of approximately million in the transactions listed above expanded our retail portfolio and both strengthened our position and increased our concentration in the mid atlantic region 
in addition  we decreased our debt to market capitalization ratio  which  combined with our borrowing capacity under our new million unsecured revolving line of credit  positions us to pursue strategic opportunities as they arise 
we also announced that we intend to create a five person office of the chairman that we believe will enable the company to maximize the talent and experience of our management team to further support our growth initiatives 
a process is underway to recruit a new chief financial officer to replace mr 
glickman  who would then become our president and chief operating officer and a member of the office of the chairman 
our revenues consist primarily of fixed rental income and additional rent in the form of expense reimbursements and percentage rents rents that are based on a percentage of our tenants sales derived from our income producing retail properties 
we receive income from our joint venture real estate investments  in which we have equity interests that range from to 
we also receive income from pri derived from the management and leasing services it provides to properties owned by third parties and to properties owned by joint ventures in which we have an interest 
our net income increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales of real estate properties and interests in real estate in generated gains of million  net of minority interest  as compared to million  net of minority interest in property acquisitions caused an increase in our real estate revenues  with a corresponding increase in property operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense 
these increases were partially offset by the sale of our multifamily portfolio

critical accounting policies pursuant to the securities and exchange commission sec disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies  the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized available information including the company s past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
revenue recognition the company derives over of its revenues from tenant rents and other tenant related activities 
tenant rents include base rents  percentage rents  expense reimbursements such as common area maintenance  real estate taxes and utilities  amortization of above and below market intangibles and straight line rents 
the company records base rents on a straight line basis  which means that the monthly base rent income according to the terms of the company s leases with its tenants is adjusted so that an average monthly rent is recorded for each tenant over the term of its lease 
the difference between base rent and straight line rent is a non cash increase or decrease to rental income 
the straight line rent adjustment increased revenue by approximately million in  million in and million in the significant increase in was due to property acquisitions 
amortization of above and below market lease intangibles decreased revenue by million and million in and  respectively  as described below under intangible assets 
such amortization was not required to be recorded prior to percentage rents represent rental income that the tenant pays based on a percentage of its sales 
tenants that pay percentage rent usually pay in one of two ways  either a percentage of their total sales or a percentage of sales over a certain threshold 
in the latter case  the company does not record percentage rent until the sales threshold has been reached 
deferred revenue represents rental revenue received from tenants prior to their due dates 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area maintenance costs 
expense reimbursement payments generally are made monthly based on a budgeted amount determined at the beginning of the year 
during the year  the company s income increases or decreases based on actual expense levels and changes in other factors that influence the reimbursement amounts  such as occupancy levels 
as of december  and  the company accrued income of million and million respectively  because reimbursable expense levels were greater than amounts billed 
shortly after the end of the year  the company prepares a reconciliation of the actual amounts due from tenants 
the difference between the actual amount due and the amounts paid by the tenant throughout the year is billed or credited to the tenant  depending on whether the tenant paid too much or too little during the year 
termination fee income is recognized in the period when a termination agreement is signed and the company is no longer obligated to provide space to the tenant 
in the event that a tenant is in bankruptcy when the termination agreement is signed  termination fee income is deferred and recognized when it is received 
the company s other significant source of revenues comes from the provision of management services to third parties  including property management  brokerage  leasing and development 
management fees generally are a percentage of managed property revenues or cash receipts 
leasing fees are earned upon the consummation of new leases 
development fees are earned over the time period of the development activity 
these activities collectively are referred to as management fees in the consolidated statement of income 
there are no significant cash versus accrual differences for these activities 
real estate land  buildings and fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and or replacements  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows buildings years land improvements years furniture fixtures years tenant improvements lease term the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful life of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
if the company were to lengthen the expected useful life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over more years  and result in less depreciation expense and higher annual net income 
assessment by the company of certain other lease related costs must be made when the company has a reason to believe that the tenant may not be able to perform under the terms of the lease as originally expected 
this requires management to make estimates as to the recoverability of such assets 
gains from sales of real estate properties and interests in partnerships and joint ventures generally are recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for real estate sales  provided that various criteria are met relating to the terms of sale and any subsequent involvement by the company with the properties sold 
intangible assets the company accounts for its property acquisitions under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 

pursuant to sfas no 
 the purchase price of a property is allocated to the property s assets based on management s estimates of their fair value 
the determination of the fair value of intangible assets requires significant estimates by management and considers many factors involving the company s expectations about the underlying property and the general market conditions in which the property operates 
the judgment and subjectivity inherent in such assumptions can have a significant impact on the magnitude of the intangible assets that the company records 
sfas no 
provides guidance on allocating a portion of the purchase price of a property to intangible assets 
the company s methodology for this allocation includes estimating an as if vacant fair value of the physical property  which is allocated to land  building and improvements 
the difference between the purchase price and the as if vacant fair value is allocated to intangible assets 
there are three categories of intangible assets to be considered  i value of in place leases  ii above below market value of in place leases and iii customer relationship value 
the value of in place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases comparable to the acquired in place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental revenue during the assumed lease up period 
the value of in place leases is amortized as real estate amortization over the estimated weighted average remaining lease lives 
the company generally uses a weighted average life of seven years for this purpose 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimates of fair market lease rates for the comparable in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the value of above market lease values is amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the value of below market lease values is amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases including renewal options 
the company allocates no value to customer relationship intangibles if the company has pre existing business relationships with the major retailers in the acquired property because the customer relationships associated with the properties acquired provide no incremental value over the company s existing relationships 
the following table presents the company s intangible assets and liabilities as of december  and in thousands of dollars as of december  real estate held for non core total real estate held investment properties for investment value of in place lease intangibles     above market lease intangibles   sub total     goodwill    total intangible assets     below market lease intangibles   includes million related to properties acquired in connection with the crown merger  million related to properties acquired in connection with the acquisitions from the rouse company and million related to other acquisitions 
includes million related to properties acquired in connection with the crown merger  million related to properties acquired in connection with the acquisitions from the rouse company and million related to other acquisitions 
includes million related to properties acquired in connection with the crown merger  million related to properties acquired in connection with the acquisitions from the rouse company and million related to other acquisitions 
represents amounts recorded related to the acquisition of the non core properties in connection with the crown merger 
represents amounts recorded in connection with the acquisition of beaver valley mall in amortization expense recorded during the years ended december  and for the value of in place leases totaled million and million  respectively 
the amortization of above below market leases resulted in a net reduction in rental income of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s intangible assets will amortize in the next five years and thereafter as follows in thousands of dollars in place above below year ended december  lease intangibles market leases and thereafter   total   in accordance with sfas no 
see below  in place lease intangibles of properties held for sale are not amortized 
debt premiums debt assumed in connection with property acquisitions is marked to market at the acquisition date and the premium is amortized through interest expense over the remaining term of the debt  resulting in a non cash decrease in interest expense 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations the company generally considers assets to be held for sale when the sale transaction has been approved by the appropriate level of management and there are no known material contingencies relating to the sale such that the sale is probable within one year 
the determination to classify an asset as held for sale requires significant estimates by management about the property and the expected market for the property 
management must also determine if it will be possible under those market conditions to sell the property for an acceptable price within one year 
when assets are identified by management as held for sale  the company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price  net of selling costs of such assets 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net book value of the assets  a valuation allowance is established 
accordingly  the results of operations of operating properties classified as held for sale after january  the date on which the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
are reflected as discontinued operations 
properties that have been sold by the company for which the company has no significant continuing involvement also are reflected as discontinued operations 
asset impairment on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is considered impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
these estimates take into consideration factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
in addition  these estimates may consider a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or when a range is estimated 
the determination of undiscounted cash flows requires significant estimates by management  including the expected course of action at the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted cash flows arising from changes in the anticipated action to be taken with respect to the property could impact the determination of whether an impairment exists and whether the effects could materially impact the company s net income 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
the company conducts an annual review of goodwill balances for impairment and to determine whether any adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill are required 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company makes estimates of the collectibility of its accounts receivable related to tenant rents including base rents  straight line rentals  expense reimbursements and other revenue or income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  with respect to tenants in bankruptcy  the company makes estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims in assessing the estimated collectibility of the related receivable 
in some cases  the time required to reach an ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income 
liquidity and capital resources equity offering in august  the company issued  common shares in a public offering at per share 
the company received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million after deducting payment of the underwriting discount of per share and offering expenses 
the company used approximately million of the net proceeds for the willow grove park acquisition  approximately million for the ikea acquisition  million to repay amounts outstanding under the company s line of credit  and the remainder for working capital purposes 
credit facility on november   the company completed the replacement of its million secured line of credit with a million unsecured revolving line of credit the credit facility with an option to increase the credit facility to million under prescribed conditions 
the credit facility bears interest at a rate between and per annum over libor based on the company s leverage 
the availability of funds under the credit facility is subject to the company s compliance with financial and other covenants and agreements  some of which are described below 
completion of the credit facility was timely as the previous revolving line of credit was set to expire in december it has positioned the company with substantial liquidity to fund the company s business plan and to pursue strategic opportunities as they arise 
the credit facility has a term of three years with an additional one year extension provided that there is no event of default at that time

capital resources the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through its available working capital and net cash provided by operations 
the company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow the company to make any distributions necessary to enable the company to continue to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in addition  the company believes that net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to permit the company to pay the million of annual dividends payable on the preferred shares issued in connection with the crown merger 
the company also believes that the foregoing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund its short term liquidity needs for the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the company expects to have capital expenditures relating to leasing and property improvements in of approximately million 
the following are some of the risks that could impact the company s cash flows and require the funding of future distributions  capital expenditures  tenant improvements and or leasing commissions with sources other than operating cash flows o unexpected changes in operations that could result from the integration of the properties acquired in  o increase in tenant bankruptcies reducing revenue and operating cash flows  o increase in interest expenses as a result of borrowing incurred in order to finance long term capital requirements such as property and portfolio acquisitions  o increase in interest rates affecting the company s net cost of borrowing  o increase in insurance premiums and or the company s portion of claims  o eroding market conditions in one or more of the company s primary geographic regions adversely affecting property operating cash flows  and o disputes with tenants over common area maintenance and other charges 
the company expects to meet certain long term capital requirements such as property and portfolio acquisitions  expenses associated with acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities 
in general  when the credit markets are tight  the company may encounter resistance from lenders when the company seeks financing or refinancing for properties or proposed acquisitions 
the following are some of the potential impediments to accessing additional funds under the credit facility o constraining leverage covenants under the credit facility  o increased interest rates affecting coverage ratios  and o reduction in the company s consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda affecting coverage ratios

through december    class a units had been issued 
the company also agreed to issue additional class a units with respect to development and predevelopment properties acquired in the transaction 
a special committee of disinterested members of the company s board of trustees was appointed to determine whether the remaining  class a units for the period from january  to september  have been earned and how many class a units are payable with respect to the development and predevelopment properties 
the special committee and its independent legal and accounting advisors and the former affiliates of the rubin organization and their advisors have engaged in discussions concerning the appropriate number of class a units to be issued with respect to these matters

contingent liabilities in june and july respectively  of  a former administrative employee and a former building engineer of preit rubin  inc pri pled guilty to criminal charges related to the misappropriation of funds at a property owned by independence blue cross ibc for which pri provided certain management services 
pri provided these services from january to december the former employees worked under the supervision of the director of real estate for ibc  who earlier pled guilty to criminal charges 
together with other individuals  the former pri employees and ibc s director of real estate misappropriated funds from ibc through a series of schemes 
ibc has estimated its losses at approximately million  and has alleged that pri is responsible for such losses under the terms of a management agreement 
the company understands that ibc has recovered million under fidelity policies issued by ibc s insurance carriers 
in addition  several defendants in the criminal proceedings have forfeited assets having an estimated value of approximately million which have been or will be liquidated by the united states justice department and applied toward restitution 
the restitution and insurance recoveries result in a significant mitigation of ibc s losses and potential claims against pri  although pri may be subject to subrogation claims from ibc s insurance carriers for all or a portion of the amounts paid by them to ibc 
the company believes that pri has valid defenses to any potential claims by ibc and that pri has insurance to cover some or all of any potential payments to ibc 
the company is unable to estimate or determine the likelihood of any loss to the company 
following the company s sale of its wholly owned multifamily properties  the purchaser of those properties has made three separate claims against the company seeking unspecified damages from the company related to alleged breaches of representations and warranties under the sale agreement and an alleged breach by the company of the company s covenant to operate the multifamily properties in the ordinary course between when the sale agreement was entered into and when the transactions closed 
the company has denied liability on all three claims and intends to defend vigorously against any possible lawsuit 
litigation in april  a joint venture  of which a subsidiary of the company holds a interest  filed a complaint in the court of chancery of the state of delaware against the delaware department of transportation and its secretary alleging failure of the department and the secretary to take actions agreed upon in a settlement agreement necessary for development of the company s christiana phase ii project 
in october  the chancery court decided that the department did breach the terms of the settlement agreement and remitted the matter to the superior court of the state of delaware for a determination of damages 
the delaware department of transportation has appealed the chancery court s decision to the delaware supreme court 
the company is not in a position to predict the outcome of this litigation or its ultimate effect on the construction of the christiana phase ii project 
competition and credit risk the company s retail properties compete with other retail properties in their trade areas as well as alternative retail formats  including catalogs  home shopping networks and internet commerce 
economic factors  such as employment trends and the level of interest rates  impact retail property sales 
some of the company s properties are of the same type and are within the same market area as other competitive properties 
this results in the competition for both acquisition of prime sites and for tenants to occupy the space that the company and its competitors develop and manage 
the existence of competitive properties could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to lease space and on the level of rents it can obtain 
the company is vulnerable to credit risk if retailers that lease space from the company are unable to continue operating in its retail properties 
the company is also vulnerable to the extent that certain categories of tenants could experience economic declines 
seasonality there is seasonality in the retail real estate industry 
retail property leases often provide for the payment of rents based on a percentage of sales over certain levels 
income from such rents is recorded only after the minimum sales levels have been met 
the sales levels are often met in the fourth quarter  during the december holiday season 
the company s recent decision to concentrate on the retail sector increased the company s exposure to seasonality and is expected to result in a greater percentage of the company s cash flows being received in the fourth quarter as compared to prior years 
inflation inflation can have many effects on the financial performance of the company 
retail property leases often provide for the payment of rents based on a percentage of sales  which may increase with inflation 
leases may also provide for tenants to bear all or a portion of operating expenses  which may reduce the impact of such increases on the company 
however  during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in a lease  rent increases may not keep up with inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
as of december   the company s consolidated debt portfolio consisted of  million in fixed rate mortgage notes  million borrowed under its credit facility and million in variable rate mortgage notes 
changes in market interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable portions of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value  but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in market interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the fair value 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed debt portfolio assumes an immediate basis point move in interest rates from their actual december  levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the net financial instrument position of million at december  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the net financial instrument position of million at december  based on the variable rate debt included in the company s debt portfolio as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional million in interest annually 
a basis point decrease would reduce interest incurred by million annually 
to manage interest rate risk  the company may employ options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying exposure 
the company undertakes a variety of borrowings from lines of credit  to medium and long term financings 
to limit overall interest cost  the company may use interest rate instruments  typically interest rate swaps  to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  or even a portion of its fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
interest rate differentials that arise under these swap contracts are recognized in interest expense over the life of the contracts 
the resulting cost of funds is expected to be lower than that which would have been available if debt with matching characteristics was issued directly 
the company may also employ forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying anticipated transactions 
gains and losses are deferred and recognized in net income in the same period that the underlying transaction occurs  expires or is otherwise terminated 
mortgage notes payable  which are secured by of the company s wholly owned properties  are due in installments over various terms extending to the year with interest at rates ranging from to with a weighted average interest rate of at december  mortgage notes payable for properties classified as discontinued operations are accounted for in liabilities on assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts of the expected annual maturities and the weighted average interest rates for the principal payments in the specified period in thousands of dollars fixed rate debt variable rate debt year ended december  principal payments weighted average interest rate principal payments weighted average interest rate and thereafter  the preceding table excludes scheduled maturities for properties that are classified as held for sale 
one held for sale property has a mortgage with an outstanding balance of million and an interest rate of at december  this borrowing is expected to be repaid upon the sale of the property in two held for sale properties are included in a property pool that secures a mortgage loan with gecc that has an interest rate of 
the portion of the gecc mortgage loan that is associated with the two held for sale properties is million 
because the information presented above includes only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
the information presented herein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the hedging strategies at the time and interest rates
