san jose water company is a publicly traded investor owned water utilities 
the united states water utility industry is largely fragmented and is dominated by the municipal owned water systems 
unlike many other industries  the water utility is regulated  and provides a life sustaining product 
this makes the water utilities subject to lower business cycle risks than non regulated industries 
throughout the years  the company continued to invest in utility plant  which reflected a diligent and disciplined approach to stewardship of the water system

critical accounting policies sjw corp 
has identified accounting policies delineated below as the policies critical to its business operations and the understanding of the results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
sjw corp 
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the corporation s business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect the corporation s reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation s critical accounting policies are as follows balancing account the california public utilities commission cpuc establishes a balancing account mechanism within its regulatory regime 
a separate balancing account must be maintained for each offset expense item eg  purchased water  purchased power and pump tax 
the purpose of a balancing account is to track the under collection or over collection associated with expense changes and the revenue authorized by the cpuc to offset those expense changes 
since balances are being tracked and have to be approved by the cpuc before they can be incorporated into rates  san jose water company has not recognized the balancing account in its financial statements 
the balancing account balance varies with the seasonality of the water utility business such that during the summer months when the demand for water is at its peak  the balancing account tends to reflect an under collection  while during the winter months when demand for water is relatively lower  the balancing account tends to reflect an over collection 
had the balancing account been recognized in san jose water company s financial statements  san jose water company s retained earnings would be increased by the amount of balancing account over collection  as the case may be  or decreased by the amount of balancing account under collection  less applicable taxes 
at december   the balancing account had a net over collected balance of  which included an under collection of  accrued prior to november  and an over collection of  accrued for the period from november  through december  the net under collected balance of  as of december  included the aforementioned under collection of  and an over collection of  accrued for the period from november  through december  please also see factors that may affect future results 
accrued unbilled revenue san jose water company reads the majority of its customers meters on a bi monthly basis and records its revenue based on its meter reading results 
revenues from the meter reading date to the end of the accounting period is estimated based on historical usage patterns  production records and effective tariff rates 
the estimate of the unbilled revenue is a management estimate utilizing certain sets of assumptions and conditions which include the number of days between meter reads for each billing cycle  the customers consumption changes  and san jose water company s experiences in unaccounted for water 
actual results will differ from those estimates  which would result in operating revenue being adjusted in the period that the revision to the san jose water company s estimates is determined 
as of december  and  accrued unbilled revenue was  and  respectively 
unaccounted for water for  and approximated  and  respectively  as a percentage of production 
the estimate is based on the results of past experience  the trend and efforts in reducing the company s unaccounted for water through mains replacement and lost water reduction programs 
a change in unaccounted for water affects unbilled revenue by approximately  recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities generally accepted accounting principles for water utilities include the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities as permitted by sfas no

in accordance with sfas no 
 san jose water company records deferred costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recovered in the ratemaking process in a period different from when the costs and credits were incurred 
accounting for such costs and credits is based on management s judgments that it is probable that these costs and credits are recoverable in the future revenue of the san jose water company through the ratemaking process 
the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded by san jose water company primarily relate to the recognition of deferred income taxes for ratemaking versus tax accounting purposes 
the disallowance of any asset in future ratemaking purposes  including the deferred regulatory assets  would require san jose water company to immediately recognize the impact of the costs for financial reporting purposes 
no disallowance had to be recognized at december  and december  the net regulatory assets recorded by san jose water company were  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to recognition of asset retirement obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which was adopted on january  income taxes sjw corp 
estimates its federal and state income taxes as part of the process of preparing the financial statements 
the process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  including the evaluation of the treatment acceptable in the water utility industry and its regulatory agency 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
if actual results  due to changes in the regulatory treatment  or significant changes in tax related estimates or assumptions or changes in law  differ materially from these estimates  the provision for income taxes will be materially impacted 
pension accounting san jose water company offers a defined benefit plan  supplemental executive retirement plan and certain post retirement benefits other than pensions to employees retiring with a minimum level of service

san jose water company is regulated by the california public utilities commission cpuc 
almost all the operating revenue of san jose water company results from the sale of water at rates authorized by the cpuc 
the cpuc sets rates that are intended to provide revenues sufficient to recover operating expenses and produce a reasonable return on common equity 
san jose water company files and processes general rate applications with the cpuc on a periodic basis 
the most recent rate decision relating to san jose water company  approved in april  authorized a return on common equity in   and of 
this rate of return is within the range of recent rates of return authorized by the cpuc for water utilities 
san jose water company received a step rate increase in january totaling about to recover projected operating cost increase for additionally  san jose water company received offset rate increases in march and july  totaling about  or approximately  to recover the increased cost primarily associated with the transfer of the maintenance responsibility for approximately  fire hydrants from the city of san jose to san jose water company  as well as the increased cost of purchased water and higher pump tax charged to san jose water company by the scvwd 
on may   san jose water company filed a general rate case application with the cpuc to increase rates by  or in   or in  and  or in san jose water company is seeking these proposed increases to cover higher costs of providing water service  including higher costs of power  purchased water  pump tax  labor  security  water quality testing and reporting  and to allow for necessary improvements to the water system 
san jose water company is also requesting rate recovery of the current balance of  in its water contamination memorandum account  as well as recovery of an under collection of  accrued in its pre november  balancing account 
finally  san jose water company is requesting a rate of return on equity of for the years through a cpuc decision on the application is expected in early on september   the interim rate relief bill ab was signed into law 
the bill allows for the implementation of interim water rates in general rate cases when the cpuc fails to establish new rates in accordance with the established rate case schedule 
the interim rates would be based on a water company s existing rates increased for the amount of inflation since the last approved rate adjustment 
the bill also allows for revenue true up from the time of the implementation of the interim rates to the time of the cpuc s ultimate decision in the rate case 
in principal  this mechanism is designed to eliminate the adverse financial impact on water utilities caused by regulatory delays in general rate cases 
the bill went into effect on january  since a cpuc decision on the requested rates on the general rate case application filed with the cpuc on may  has not been issued as of december   the cpuc has allowed san jose water company an interim rate increase of approximately effective january  although the company believes that the rates currently in effect provide it with a reasonable rate of return  there is no guarantee such rates will be sufficient to provide a reasonable rate of return in the future 
there is no guarantee that the company s future rate filings will be able to obtain a satisfactory rate of return in a timely manner 
in addition  san jose water company relies on policies and regulations promulgated by the cpuc in order to  for example  recover capital expenditures  maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property  offset its production and operating costs  recover the cost of debt  maintain an optimal equity structure without over leveraging  and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non regulated operations 
if the cpuc implements policies and regulations that do not allow san jose water company to accomplish some or all of the items listed above  san jose water company s future operating results may be adversely affected 
pursuant to section of the california public utilities code  a balancing account must be kept for each expense item for which revenue offsets have been authorized ie  purchased water  purchased power and pump tax 
the purpose of a balancing account is to track the under collection or over collection associated with expense changes and the revenue authorized by the cpuc to offset those expense changes 
on november   the cpuc issued resolution w resolution implementing significant changes in the long established offset rate increase and balancing account recovery procedures applicable to water utilities 
these changes could have a significant impact on the risk profile of the water industry 
as required by the resolution  in december  the cpuc opened an order instituting rulemaking oir to evaluate existing balancing account and offset rate practices and policies 
on december   the cpuc issued an interim oir decision authorizing water utilities to recover the balancing account balances accrued prior to november  if the utility is not over earning as measured on a pro forma basis 
san jose water company had accrued an under collection of  in its balancing account prior to november  san jose water company requested rate recovery of the aforementioned under collection of  in its general rate case application filed with the cpuc on may  at this time  it is unclear whether san jose water company s ability to recover the aforementioned balancing account balance will be impacted 
this under collection of  is the component of the balance of balancing account as of december  and  respectively 
furthermore  it is uncertain how any future cpuc regulation dealing with balancing account balances accrued after november  will affect san jose water company s ability to collect such balance or to receive future offset rate relief 
for the period from november  to december   the balancing account accumulated an over collection of  at december   the balancing account  including the balances accrued prior to november   had an under collection of  on june  the cpuc issued its final oir decision d 
in which the cpuc revised the existing procedures for recovery of under collections and over collections in balancing accounts existing on or after november  as follows if a utility is within its rate case cycle and is not over earning  the utility shall recover its balancing account subject to reasonableness review  and if a utility is either within or outside of its rate case cycle and is over earning  the utility s recovery of expenses from the balancing accounts will be reduced by the amount of the over earning  again subject to reasonableness review 
utilities shall use the recorded rate of return means test to evaluate earnings for all years 
the cpuc is currently in the process of scheduling workshops to determine how these new requirements will ultimately be implemented 
as of december  san jose water company has received all its offset rate requests 
any future impact on san jose water company s ability to recover balancing account balances and receive offset rate increases cannot be determined until san jose water company s next offset rate increase request scheduled for july  changes in water supply  water supply costs or the mix of water supply could adversely affect the operating results and business of san jose water company 
san jose water company s supply of water primarily relies upon three main sources water purchased from the scvwd  surface water from its santa cruz mountains watershed  and pumped underground water 
changes and variations in quantities from each of these three sources affects the overall mix of the water supply  therefore affecting the cost of water supply 
surface water is the least costly source of water 
if there is an adverse change to the mix of water supply and san jose water company is not allowed to recover the additional or increased water supply costs  its operating results may be adversely affected 
the scvwd receives an allotment of water from state and federal water projects 
if san jose water company has difficulties obtaining a high quality water supply from the scvwd due to availability and legal restrictions  it may not be able to satisfy customer demand in its service area and its operating results and business may be adversely affected 
additionally  the availability of water from san jose water company s santa cruz mountains watershed depends on the weather and fluctuates with each season 
in a normal year  surface water supply provides of the total water supply of the system 
in a dry season with little rainfall  water supply from surface water sources may be low  thereby causing san jose water company to increase the amount of water purchased from outside sources at a higher cost than surface water and thus increasing water production costs 
in addition  san jose water company s ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations 
if new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations  the availability of surface water may be materially reduced 
a reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources  thereby increasing the water production costs and adversely affecting the operating results of san jose water company 
because the extraction of water from the groundwater basin and the operation of the water distribution system requires a significant amount of energy  increases in energy prices could increase operating expenses of san jose water company 
san jose water company continues to utilize pacific gas electric s time of use rate schedules to minimize its overall energy costs primarily for groundwater pumping 
during the winter months  typically or more of the groundwater is produced during off peak hours when electrical energy is the cheapest 
optimization and energy management efficiency is achieved through the implementation of supervisory control and data acquisition scada system software applications that control pumps based on demand and cost of energy 
in the aftermath of the attempt to deregulate the california energy market  energy costs still remain in flux  with resulting uncertainty in the company s ability to contain energy costs into the future 
fluctuations in customer demand for water due to seasonality  restrictions of use  weather and lifestyle can adversely affect operating results 
san jose water company operations are seasonal 
thus  results of operations for one quarter do not indicate results to be expected in next quarter 
rainfall and other weather conditions also affect the operations of san jose water company 
most water consumption occurs during the third quarter of each year when weather tends to be warm and dry 
in drought seasons  if customers are encouraged and required to conserve water due to a shortage of water supply or restriction of use  revenue tends to be lower 
similarly  in unusually wet seasons  water supply tends to be higher and customer demand tends to be lower  again resulting in lower revenues 
furthermore  certain lifestyle choices made by customers can affect demand for water 
for example  a significant portion of residential water use is for outside irrigation of lawns and landscaping 
if there is a decreased desire by customers to maintain landscaping for their homes  residential water demand could decrease  which may result in lower revenues 
conservation efforts  construction codes which require the use of low flow plumbing fixtures could affect water consumption 
a contamination event or other decline in source water quality could affect the water supply of san jose water company and therefore adversely affect the business and operating results 
san jose water company is subject to certain water quality risks relating to environmental regulations 
through water quality compliance programs  san jose water company continually monitors for contamination and pollution of its sources of water 
in the event of a contamination  san jose water company will likely have to procure water from more costly sources and increase future capital expenditures 
although the costs would likely be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that cpuc would approve a rate increase to recover the costs 
san jose water company is subject to litigation risks concerning water quality and contamination 
although san jose water company has not been and is not a party to any environmental and product related lawsuits  it believes such lawsuits against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years 
if san jose water company is subject to an environmental or product related lawsuit  it might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether it would be able to recover the legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties
