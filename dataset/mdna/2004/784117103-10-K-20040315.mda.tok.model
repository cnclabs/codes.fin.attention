item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in thousands  except per share data this discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated financial condition at december  and  the consolidated results of operations for the past three years  and other factors that may affect future financial performance 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data included in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
results of operations consolidated overview our operations are organized into five business segments that offer different business solutions tailored to meet the needs of particular markets 
reportable segments are private banking and trust  investment advisors  enterprises  money managers  and investments in new businesses 
the accounting policies of our business segments are the same as those used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management evaluates financial performance of our operating segments based on income from operations 
revenues and income from operations by segment for   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands private banking and trust revenues income from operations investment advisors revenues income from operations enterprises revenues income from operations money managers revenues income from operations investments in new businesses revenues loss from operations general and administrative loss from operations consolidated segment totals revenues income from operations other income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income diluted earnings per common share 
table of contents consolidated revenues increased million  or one percent  to million in compared to  but declined million  or four percent  to million in compared to the increase in our revenues in was primarily driven by the generation of new client sales in the money managers  enterprises and investments in new businesses segments 
asset based fees across all of the segments in  except private banking and trust  increased due to improved capital market conditions during the latter half of  whereas  asset based fees during were negatively affected by poor capital markets in all of our segments 
revenues in the investment advisors and enterprises segments during were impacted by the recognition of approximately million in non recurring brokerage fees 
the non recurring brokerage fees were for transition management services provided to our mutual funds during a portfolio restructuring resulting from a change in the funds sub advisors 
revenue decreased in the private banking and trust segment in both comparable periods  mainly due to the loss of several large bank clients in our fund processing business which significantly reduced total administration fees 
also  revenues in this segment were affected by a decrease in non recurring project fees for our asp solution and transaction based fees from our brokerage services 
consolidated income from operations declined million in  or two percent  after increasing million  or percent  in compared to operating margin declined to percent in after improving to percent in the decline in operating income and operating margin in was primarily attributable to increased investment spending for the development of new products and services 
a portion of this increased spending was capitalized 
in  we continued to make significant investments for the development of new products and services  but sharpened our investment priorities to better focus our efforts 
income from operations and operating margin in both comparable periods was supported by cost containment efforts and reduced discretionary spending that focused on marketing  consulting  and annual incentive compensation payments 
a portion of our personnel costs are sales commissions and non sales bonus payments that are tied to performance goals at the corporate and segment levels 
the actual amount of bonuses to be paid for the year is a function of actual performance relative to established targets 
other income includes our percentage of net earnings from our unconsolidated affiliate  realized gains and losses from available for sale securities  and interest income and expense 
other income increased million  or percent  in but decreased million  or percent  in compared to earnings from the unconsolidated affiliate increased million during due to growth in assets under management from new business and improved capital markets 
other income was negatively affected by net realized losses from available for sale securities of million in and million in diluted earnings per share in grew at a greater rate of growth as compared to net income because of a decrease in the number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share  a direct result of our stock repurchase program 
the general business climate that existed during the past few years included volatile capital markets  economic uncertainty and delayed strategic decisions by our clients and by the customers of our clients 
this resulted in reduced asset based fees due to fewer assets under management and administration  redemption of existing assets  and a reduction in the inflow of new assets 
if the economy continues to recover  we are optimistic about our ability to generate new business and cross sell our services to existing clients as they seek new alternatives to generate revenue growth while controlling costs 
however  continued adverse volatility in the capital markets could negatively affect our future revenues and earnings 
as has been the case in prior years  consolidations among our bank clients continue to be a strategic challenge for our private banking and trust segment 
the impact of bank consolidations  including recent merger announcements  could positively or negatively alter our client base and significantly affect our revenues and earnings 
we expect continued investment in initiatives related to the development of new solutions that can be leveraged across our business segments  and continued expansion of our global businesses 
we remain optimistic about the long term prospects for all of our initiatives

private banking and trust year ended december  revenues investment processing fees fund processing fees investment management fees total revenues expenses operating and development sales and marketing operating income operating margin percent of revenue operating and development sales and marketing total revenues for this segment declined million  or six percent  in  compared with  and million  or eight percent  in compared with the decrease in total revenues during and was primarily attributable to the loss of fund processing clients 
also  revenues in both comparable periods were affected by non recurring project fees and transaction based fees 
investment processing fees decreased million  or three percent  during but increased million  or two percent  in a decrease in non recurring project fees affected revenues in both comparable periods and was the primary driver for lower investment processing fees during an increase in our recurring revenues from the asp and bsp solutions served to partially offset some of this decrease 
a decrease in transaction based fees also contributed to lower revenues 

table of contents fund processing fees declined in both comparable periods primarily due to client losses which negatively impacted assets under administration and the associated asset based fee revenues 
revenues decreased million  or percent  in  compared with and million  or percent  in  compared with the decrease in fund processing fees in was also attributed to unfavorable capital markets 
operating income decreased million  or nine percent  in  compared with  and million  or four percent  in  compared with the decrease in operating income in both comparable periods was mainly due to depressed revenues  as previously mentioned  net of the decrease in direct expenses associated with these lost revenues 
margins were mainly supported by our ability to manage discretionary spending effectively  especially in the areas of marketing  consulting and annual incentive and sales compensation payments 
investment advisors year ended december  revenues expenses operating and development sales and marketing operating income operating margin percent of revenues operating and development sales and marketing revenues increased million in  or five percent  compared with  but declined million in  or four percent  compared with revenues in benefited from the recognition of approximately million in non recurring brokerage fees and an increase in asset based fees mainly due to improved capital market conditions 
the decrease in revenues in from was primarily due to a devaluation of assets under management due to poor capital market conditions 
although average assets under management increased in relative to due to market appreciation  net cash flows into our mutual funds for the year decreased due to higher than normal redemption activity 
some of the redemption activity resulted from our efforts to reposition ourselves within this business 
operating income and margins were up in each comparable period 
operating income for increased million  or ten percent  compared with  and increased million in  or percent  compared with improvements in operating income and margins in were mainly due to the increase in revenues previously described and the continuation of certain cost containment measures 
these improvements  however  were offset by higher investment spending for new products and services and the recognition of certain one time costs 
operating income and margin improvement in came mostly from cost containment measures in the areas of incentive compensation costs and marketing expenditures 

table of contents enterprises year ended december  revenues expenses operating and development sales and marketing operating income operating margin percent of revenue operating and development sales and marketing revenues increased million during  or percent  compared with after declining million in  or percent  compared with growth in revenues in was primarily driven by the generation of new client sales  million in non recurring brokerage fees  and an increase in assets under management from improved capital markets 
the decline in revenues in was mainly due to the impact of negative capital markets and the loss of two retirement solutions clients in late operating income and margins increased in both comparable periods 
operating income in grew because of the growth in revenues discussed previously coupled with the continuation of our efforts to control discretionary expenses 
the rise in operating income and margin in relative to was chiefly attributable to lower expenses in the areas of marketing and incentive compensation 
we also benefited from a decrease in technology development costs in with the completion of our treasury trading platform in money managers year ended december  revenues expenses operating and development sales and marketing operating income operating margin percent of revenue operating and development sales and marketing revenues increased million in  or percent  compared with and million in  or percent  compared with revenue growth for the past two years was primarily from sales of new business 
the alternative investment market provided the majority of our new business activity in and in this particular market  we added new clients in  and clients in better capital markets in helped boost revenues whereas poor capital markets during constricted revenue growth 

table of contents operating income increased to million in from million in operating margin declined three percentage points in relative to due to spending associated with new product offerings and enhancing our infrastructure 
a substantial portion of this spending was for increased personnel and other operating costs intended to differentiate our existing product offerings and introduce an outsourcing solution for separately managed accounts 
the increase in operating margin of five percentage points in relative to was supported by measures to control discretionary costs 
investments in new businesses year ended december  revenues expenses operating and development sales and marketing operating loss operating margin percent of revenue operating and development sales and marketing revenues increased in both comparable periods  rising million in  or percent  compared with  and million in  or eight percent  over the year over year increases in revenues are primarily due to new business activity 
most of the revenue growth came from the global institutional business in both the uk and canada  as well as  in the individual advisor and private banking distribution channels as our product offerings continue to gain market acceptance 
losses from operations increased by million in  or percent  compared with this increase in operating losses is attributable to continued investments in globalizing our business  including infrastructure expenses and increased expenditures in sales and marketing 
also  we continue to invest in new us initiatives to help ultra high net worth investors manage their wealth 
these investments include technology  marketing  and infrastructure related costs 
we expect continued investments in both our global and family wealth businesses in operating losses and margin improvement in as compared with were affected by increased revenues  a reduction in our investment spending  and some cost containment measures 
general administrative year ended december  general and administrative expenses percent of revenue general and administrative expense includes corporate overhead costs and other costs not directly attributable to any of our business segments 
compliance with existing and future regulations and responding to and complying with recent regulatory activity affecting our businesses is a key priority 
we have responded and are currently responding to various regulatory examinations and requests and are generally implementing changes and reviewing our compliance procedures 
these activities resulted in additional general and administrative costs during and may continue to result in higher general and administrative costs in 
table of contents other income other income consists of the following year ended december  equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliate net loss from investments interest income interest expense other income total other income  net equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliate includes our less than percent ownership in the general partnership lsv asset management  or lsv see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in net earnings of lsv in and was mainly due to an increase in assets under management from new business activity 
earnings in were also partially boosted by increases in performance based fees 
net loss from investments in includes a loss of million from a decline in the fair value of derivative financial instruments  whereas  included a gain of million from an increase in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
these derivative financial instruments are used to minimize the price risk associated with changes in the fair value of our seed investments in new investments being offered 
these derivative financial investments did not qualify for hedge accounting under current accounting rules 
as a result  changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments were recorded in current period earnings whereas the change in the fair value of the hedged asset will be realized upon sale in future period earnings 
management s decision to enter into derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting may cause volatility in quarterly earnings 
net loss from investments in also includes a charge of million for other than temporary declines in market value see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
net loss from investments in also includes the write off about million associated with an investment in a private technology company 
interest income is earned based upon the amount of cash invested in interest bearing accounts 
fluctuations in interest income recognized for one period in relation to another is due to changes in the average cash balances invested for the period and or changes in interest rates 
interest income was down in and due to lower interest rates despite an increase in our average cash balances 
our interest expense is directly attributable to our long term debt and other borrowings 
interest expense fluctuations result from debt transactions or changes in interest rates 
interest expense during the past three years has increased mainly due to new borrowings  net of principal payments against existing debt arrangements and lower interest rates 
a portion of our interest expense in and was capitalized because some of our debt was used for the construction of an additional building at our corporate headquarters 
income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in  percent in  and percent in the rate reduction in  compared to  was due to an increase in the amount of research and development expenditures for which we are claiming a tax credit and a reassessment of valuation allowance for capital losses 
certain expenditures associated with research and development which qualified for a tax credit reduced our tax liability and effective tax rate 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  end of year cash requirements and liquidity needs are expected to be funded through our cash flow from operations and our capacity for additional borrowing 
we currently have a credit facility that provides for borrowings of up to million 
the availability of the credit facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants set forth in the agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   our unused sources of liquidity consisted of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and the credit facility of million 
net cash provided by operating activities grew million in and million in from the prior comparable years primarily from an increase in income and favorable working capital trends through improved productivity and lower discretionary costs 
however  net cash from operating activities in both comparable periods were negatively affected by the reduced tax benefit received from stock option exercises 
net cash used in investing activities primarily includes capital expenditures and purchases and sales of available for sale securities 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  million in  and million in our capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of our corporate headquarters 
we completed the construction on our new data center in early and we also completed construction of an additional building and parking structure in purchases and sales of our mutual funds and other securities were mainly for the testing and subsequent startup of new investment programs to be offered to our clients 
purchases were approximately million in  million in  and million in sales totaled million in  million in  and million in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capitalized software development costs were million in and million in this increase was due to a higher amount of software development costs eligible for capitalization see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in financing activities primarily includes principal payments on our debt  the repurchase of our common stock and dividend payments 
principal payments on our long term debt were million in  million in and million in in  we borrowed million as a term loan from a lending institution 
our long term debt is subject to various covenants contained in each lending agreement 
currently  these covenants do not negatively affect our liquidity 
during  we replaced our million line of credit with a million credit facility 
the credit facility was generated through a syndicate of lenders and may be used for general corporate purposes  including the repurchase of our common stock see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of our common stock of up to million 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
as of february   we still had million of authorization remaining for the purchase of our common stock under this program see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash dividends paid were million or 
per share in and million or 
per share in our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 
per share on december  the dividend was paid on january  for million 
we believe our operating cash flow  available borrowing capacity  and existing cash and cash equivalents should provide adequate funds for continuing operations  continued investment in new products and equipment  our common stock repurchase program  expansion of our corporate headquarters  future dividend payments  and principal and interest payments on our long term debt 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements or transactions with structured finance and special purpose entities 
our off balance sheet commitments are generally limited to future payments under non cancelable operating leases for facilities  data processing equipment  and software and other maintenance agreements

critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
we believe that the following accounting policies require extensive judgment by our management to determine the recognition and timing of amounts recorded in our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the periods in which the related services are performed provided that pervasive evidence of an agreement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
cash received by us in advance of the performance of services is deferred and recognized as revenue when earned 
our principal sources of revenues are information processing and software servicing fees that are recurring in nature and earned based on the number of trust accounts being serviced and non recurring project fees that are determined upon contractual agreements  and asset management  administration and distribution fees calculated as a percentage of the total average daily net assets under management or administration 
the majority of our revenues are based on contractual arrangements and do not require judgment by management 
certain portions of our revenues do require management s consideration to determine the amount and timing of recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our clients to make their scheduled payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily based on an aging analysis of the total outstanding receivables balance at each balance sheet date 
other factors are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  such as historical trends  the financial condition of our clients and other factors that may be deemed appropriate 
based upon this analysis  the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted to an amount that is sufficient to cover expected losses from doubtful accounts 

table of contents investments available for sale we value our investments in marketable securities based on quoted market prices 
we review our investments in marketable securities on a quarterly basis with regard to impairment 
factors considered in determining other than temporary impairment are significant or prolonged declines in the fair value of our investments  our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period sufficient to allow the value to recover  and the financial condition of the investment 
after considering these factors  if we believe that a decline is other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value through current period earnings 
computer software development costs we utilize internally developed computer software as part of our product offering 
in the development of a new software product  substantial consideration must be given by management to determine whether costs incurred are research and development costs  or internal software development costs eligible for capitalization 
management must consider a number of different factors during their evaluation of each computer software development project that includes estimates and assumptions 
costs considered to be research and development are expensed as incurred 
after meeting certain requirements  internal software development costs are capitalized as incurred 
the recoverability of capitalized computer software development costs requires considerable judgment by management which includes  but is not limited to  an evaluation of expected future revenues and cash flows  acceptability of the product in the market  the ability to support the product in a cost effective manner  technological enhancements and any other factor deemed appropriate 
if management determines that certain software products are considered either obsolete or incapable of producing sustainable future cash flows  an impairment charge would be required 
the amount of the impairment charge would be based on estimates of the software s anticipated future cash flows compared to its book value 
income tax accounting the computation of our income tax expense requires the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations in many taxing jurisdictions around the world 
actual income tax expense can differ significantly from our estimates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on our estimated future taxable income and tax strategies 
we also recognize a liability for expected future tax contingencies 
we assess the liability based on our review of various tax issues and interpretations of tax law 
differences between our estimates and actual results could have a significant impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
the assessment of critical accounting policies is not meant to be an all inclusive discussion of the uncertainties to financial results that can occur from the application of the full range of our accounting policies 
materially different financial results could occur in the application of other accounting policies as well 
also  materially different results can occur upon the adoption of new accounting standards 
new accounting pronouncements see the discussion of new accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
our excess cash is principally invested in short term  highly liquid financial instruments  mainly money market funds  with a substantial portion of such investments having initial maturities of three months or less 
our investment portfolio also includes some long term fixed income mutual funds  principally invested in federal government agency securities 
we place our investments in financial instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
a portion of our long term debt is based upon a variable rate which renews every three months 
while changes in interest rates could decrease interest income or increase interest expense  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to changes in interest rates 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  marketable securities and trade receivables 
cash deposits are maintained with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits 
cash equivalents are principally invested in short term money market funds or placed with major banks and high credit qualified financial institutions 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to our receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and their dispersion across geographic areas 
no single customer represents greater than ten percent of total accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk we transact business in the local currencies of various foreign countries  principally canada  ireland  the united kingdom and south korea 
the total of all of our foreign operations accounts for less than ten percent of total consolidated revenues 
also  most of our foreign operations match local currency revenues with local currency costs 
due to these reasons  we do not hedge against foreign operations nor do we expect any material loss with respect to foreign currency risk 
price risk we are exposed to price risk associated with changes in the fair value of investments in marketable securities relating to the startup of new pooled investment offerings 
the length of time that funds remain invested in these new pooled investment offerings is dependent on client subscriptions 
we will redeem our investments as clients subscribe to these new investment offerings 
to provide protection against potential fair value changes for these investments  we have entered into various derivative financial instruments 
as of december   we held derivative financial instruments with a notional amount of million with various terms  generally less than two years 
changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments are recognized in current period earnings  whereas  the change in the fair value of the investment is recorded on the balance sheet in other comprehensive income 
therefore  changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument and changes in the fair value of the investment are not recognized through earnings in the same period 
we did not enter into or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during or we recorded an impairment charge of million in and million in related to other than temporary declines in the fair value of certain securities held within our investment portfolio 
also  current period earnings includes a loss of million in compared to a gain of million in relating to changes in the fair value of derivative financial instrument 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical ten percent change in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments would not be material to our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
market risk a significant portion of our revenues are based upon the market value of assets we manage or administer 
a decline in the market value of these assets as a result of changes in market conditions  the general economy or other factors will negatively impact our revenues and earnings
