overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets products that perform diagnostic testing at sites outside of traditional hospital and clinical laboratories to assist in the assessment of the risk of heart disease  diabetes and certain liver diseases and in the monitoring of therapy to treat those diseases 
our products are sold worldwide 
our primary market is the physician laboratory market  which consists of approximately  sites that are registered with the centers for medicare medicaid services cms  approximately  of which are registered to perform 
table of contents only tests that have been waived under clia 
in fiscal year  sales of our products to the physician office laboratory market represented of our revenue 
our corporate headquarters is located in hayward  california 
all of our manufacturing  research  regulatory and administrative activities are conducted at this location 
we sell our products through a worldwide network of over distributors 
we have regional sales managers who coordinate and work with our distribution partners to identify and promote sales of our products 
we also employ field technical service representatives who are responsible for field customer service and customer retention initiatives within our existing installed base of products 
recent events we have experienced recent significant developments and are monitoring certain events that may have an impact on our company  including the following in june  we announced that the german patent and trademark office granted us a patent on a new method for the measurement of hdl cholesterol in human blood 
we also filed patent applications for this new method in the united states and in europe 
we believe this new method will allow us to add new analytes to our disposable cassette format by eliminating certain interferences created using our original method 
in september  we received k clearance from the fda for our ast test 
upon receiving a clia waiver  we plan to market ast in conjunction with our alt test  which will allow health care providers to monitor both the impact of and potential side effect on the liver from lipid lowering and diabetic therapies 
in december  we entered into a settlement agreement with roche in connection with ongoing patent infringement litigation 
the settlement  which serves as the basis for the dismissal of all patent litigation between us and roche on a worldwide basis  included a lump sum payment by us to roche in the amount of million 
in addition  roche agreed to grant an irrevocable  non exclusive worldwide license to us for its patents related to hdl cholesterol 
as part of this settlement we will pay roche an ongoing royalty that will be applied to only the hdl portion of the cholesterol test cassettes we sell 
in december  provisions for cholesterol and diabetes screening were included in the federal prescription drug and medicare improvement act of implementation of the bill is not expected before january  we believe that the addition of reimbursement for screening with benefit both our health promotion and physician office market segments as more individuals will be screened for high cholesterol and diabetes and ultimately treated by a physician 
in april  we announced a market development and product distribution agreement involving a novel and proprietary system for assessing vascular endothelial dysfunction which will further broaden our portfolio of products that enable physicians to assess and monitor heart disease and diabetes 
we will invest resources to support pre launch market research and market development activities 
we will also be responsible for the sale and installation of the endo pat in early adopter sites to 
table of contents further promote recognition of the product and technology while assessing united states market development needs 
in fiscal year  our revenue growth was driven primarily by sales of our products to the physician office laboratory market  which increased over fiscal year and represented of our total revenue  up from of total revenue in fiscal year given the expected continued growth in the number of clia waived physician office labs and in our estimated installed base of ldx analyzers  we plan to devote a majority of our sales and marketing expenditures toward increasing both our penetration of this market and the utilization of single use disposable cassettes by our existing end user physician customers 
in fiscal year we plan to begin promotional awareness programs and other initiatives to enhance the sales of our cassette products  which currently represent over of our revenue 
we expect that the introduction and continued development of products which can be used on our existing ldx platform or another platform that could be clia waived and can be sold to our installed base will be an important component of our growth strategy in the physician office laboratory market 
in conjunction with providing periodic promotional incentives to our distribution partners  we have historically offered small discounts to our standard distributor pricing for large unit volume purchases 
throughout fiscal year  we experienced increasing demand by our distribution partners to offer such discounts toward the end of each quarter 
we became concerned about the future impact on end user pricing and the inefficiencies in our operations that resulted from month to month swings in shipping volume 
as a result  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we decided to reduce the amount of product we sold to our distribution partners at a discount 
in addition  we notified our distribution partners that in the future we will no longer offer any discounts of this type 
we expect that this change in business practice will have a negative impact on our revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year and may have a similar impact in the second quarter of fiscal year this strategic decision is part of a larger effort to improve the consistency and predictability of sales and the efficiency of our operations 
going forward  we believe we are in a position to capture sales from new products  strategic alliances  such as the market development and product distribution agreement with itamar  and recent favorable legislative trends 
as a result  we believe that focusing on distributor and installed base management will improve both the consistency and predictability of our sales effort and operating margins 
in fiscal year  we anticipate leveraging our installed base and current ldx platform with the introduction of three new single use test cassette products 
results of operations in the following discussion of our results of operations  results related to wellcheck have been classified as discontinued operations for fiscal year and reclassified as discontinued operations for fiscal year and fiscal year additionally  for comparative purposes certain costs have been reclassified for fiscal years and

our total revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year due primarily to increased revenue relating to the sale of single use test cassettes to the physician office laboratory market  which was attributable to the continued adoption of the atp iii guidelines for treatment of high cholesterol  the increased number of clia waived laboratories and increased growth in the use of statin drugs  all of which resulted in higher demand for our ldx analyzer and single use test cassettes 
revenue from the physician office laboratory market in fiscal year increased over fiscal year this increase was attributed to a increase in unit volume for single use test cassettes 
we expect that the physician office laboratory market  which represented of our revenue in fiscal year  will continue to be our fastest growing market for the foreseeable future 
revenue from the health promotion market decreased in fiscal year due mainly to a reduction in revenue for the gdx analyzers and related single use test cartridges 
the comparative decline related to a single large sale of gdx analyzers and other related products to a single customer during fiscal year in general  the health promotion market revenue also declined due to reduced promotional testing spending by pharmaceutical companies 

table of contents international revenue increased in fiscal year over fiscal year revenue for single use test cassettes increased while the number of cassettes sold increased 
the increase was primarily due to the impact of promotional activities related to the launch by astrazeneca plc of its statin drug crestor 
international ldx analyzer revenue decreased in fiscal year due to lower promotional equipment spending by pharmaceutical companies 
for the foreseeable future  we expect this market will continue to be effected by reduced promotional spending by pharmaceutical companies  primarily in europe 
we believe revenue from the sale of the ldx analyzer and single use test cassettes will continue to be the primary driver of our revenue growth during the next fiscal year 
during the next fiscal year  we intend to focus more of our sales and marketing efforts on customer retention  with the goal of increasing the consumption of single use test cassettes for both current and new products by our installed base 
revenue for the gdx analyzer and single use test cartridges increased in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the benefit of a full year of revenue attributed to the product  which was launched in july in fiscal year  we expect revenue from the gdx analyzer and single use test cartridges to remain flat or decrease slightly 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes direct labor  direct material  overhead and royalties 
our cost of revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in cost of revenue related primarily to additional products shipped in support of the increase in revenue in fiscal year over the prior fiscal year 
additionally  expenses associated with promotional programs tied to revenue increased in fiscal year such expenses are expected to decrease from fiscal year levels during the next fiscal year due to additional controls to limit the scope of such programs 
factory spending increased in fiscal year over fiscal year  while unit production of single use test cassettes increased 
the increase in spending is related to royalty  material scrap  warranty and product testing costs 
during fiscal year  we anticipate factory spending will continue to increase at a rate lower than the increase in unit production as we improve manufacturing efficiency through increased production and improving control of spending and material variances 
we have licensed certain technology used in some of our products 
one ongoing royalty agreement  which expires in calendar year  requires us to pay a royalty of on net sales of single use test cassettes 
in december  as part of a settlement agreement with roche  we entered into another royalty agreement that will be applied to only the hdl portion of cholesterol test cassettes we sell 
this new agreement was effective as of december  and expires on december  total royalty expense was million in fiscal year and  in fiscal year and was included in cost of revenue 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions  bonuses  expenses for outside services  marketing programs and travel expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in wages and related and travel reflects a full year impact of increased staffing related to providing additional technical service support to our installed base  which was expanded late in fiscal year  and a severance accrual for our former vice president of sales and marketing 
the increase in outside 
table of contents services related to market research and expenses related to industry specific public relations initiatives 
product marketing expenses decreased primarily due to a reduction in free product samples and lower distributor relation expenses which declined due to our refocusing of sales activities towards more direct involvement by our sales force with the distributors 
research and development 
our research and development expenses include salaries  bonuses  expenses for outside services  supplies and amortization of capital equipment 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increases in wages and related  outside services and development materials all relate to increased efforts to develop new test cassette products for use on our ldx analyzer 
we expect our costs for new product development to remain constant or increase slightly during fiscal year as we prepare new products for launch into the marketplace 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits  as well as expenses for outside professional services including information services  legal  accounting  insurance and costs associated with our board of directors 
general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in shared facilities costs was attributable to a full year in the expanded space leased for our corporate offices in hayward  california 
additionally  a larger percentage of shared facilities cost were included in the general and administrative expense in fiscal year we expect that the cost of shared facilities will remain constant or increase slightly during the next year 
insurance costs increased due to the additional policy premiums for directors and officers insurance 
outside service expenses increased due to larger expenditures for legal  accounting and consulting services during fiscal year as we continue to grow and expand into new jurisdictions and maintain profitability  we will continue to register with new state tax agencies 
while the cost of taxes and other fees paid to state agencies have not been material  we have experienced a significant increase in accounting services expense related to the administration and filing of state income tax documentation 
additionally  we have required more outside professional services to meet the increasing cost of being a public company  including additional requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of we expect that fees for these outside services will remain constant or increase in the foreseeable future 
other operating costs 
in fiscal year  other operating costs were  we had no corresponding operating costs in fiscal year these costs related to the write off of an option to purchase a patent  which we determined no longer had an economic value

interest income reflects income from the investment of cash balances and marketable securities  net of expenses 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal the decline in interest income is attributable to lower yields on securities investments 
gains from the sale of marketable securities were  during 
table of contents fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year we expect income from securities investments to remain constant unless there is a material increase in the market yield on corporate bonds 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  is primarily related to the release of the valuation allowance previously established for our deferred tax assets 
we released million of valuation allowance in fiscal year and million in fiscal year based upon projected future operating performances  we currently believe that we will be able to fully utilize the value of our net operating loss carry forward nol through reductions of taxes to be paid in future periods 
during fiscal year  the amount of valuation allowance we released was the estimated amount to be utilized during the next two fiscal years 
as of march   we had nol carryforwards of million available to reduce future taxable income for federal income tax purposes  however  we have fully consumed our nol carryforwards for california state income tax purposes 
additionally  we had research and development and other tax credit carryforwards available of million to reduce income taxes for federal income tax purposes and research and development credits of  for state income tax purposes 
as a result of a change in ownership for tax purposes which occurred in fiscal year  we have an annual limitation of approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes on the combined use of approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and the use of approximately  of federal and state tax credit carryforwards

our total revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in revenue primarily reflected an increase in unit sales of single use test cassettes 
the physician office laboratory market unit sales of single use test cassettes increased 
additionally  health promotion market unit cassettes sales increased 
these increases were offset by decreased unit cassette sales in the international market  which declined due to reduced promotional activities from large pharmaceutical companies 
domestic revenue represented of total revenue in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year international revenue represented of our total revenue in fiscal year and in fiscal year ldx analyzer unit sales decreased worldwide in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decline was mainly in the health promotion market in which unit sales decreased 
international unit sales decreased

table of contents cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes direct labor  direct material  overhead and royalties 
our cost of revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of sales was primarily related to the introduction of the gdx analyzer and test cartridges  which have a lower margin than the products we manufacture 
gross margins for ldx related products were in both fiscal years and manufacturing spending increased  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year which was consistent with the increase in production of single use test cassettes 
we have licensed certain technology used in some of our products 
a license agreement  which expires in  requires us to pay a royalty of on net sales of single use test cassettes

interest and other income  net 
interest income reflects income from the investment of cash balances and marketable securities  net of expenses 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year this decrease was primarily the result of reduced yields on cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with higher bank service fees 
realized gains from sales of marketable securities were  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year income taxes 
we have historically experienced significant operating losses and operate in an industry subject to rapid technological changes 
therefore  at march   we provided a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding its ability to generate future taxable income and the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
in  we recorded a benefit of million from the partial reversal of our valuation allowance 
based on improved operating performance  we determined that a reduction of the valuation allowance was appropriate based on estimated taxable income through of approximately million 
we recorded a  tax provision for income taxes in fiscal year and a  provision for income taxes in fiscal year which represented the estimated state income taxes payable  reduced for the use of nols and tax credit carryforwards 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations include all revenue  cost of revenue  compensation  benefits  travel and expenses for outside professional services including information services and legal expenses related to the operations of wellcheck 
the loss from discontinued operations increased  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the primary reason for the increased loss was a smaller number of consumer testing events at which wellcheck provided its testing services  which reduced the amount of billing to sponsors

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow information for the three years ended march  was as follows in thousands mar  mar  mar  cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  including employee stock option exercises  and net cash provided by operations 
from our inception to march   we have raised million in net proceeds from equity financings 
in addition to these amounts  we have available a million revolving bank line of credit agreement which was renewed in july and will expire in september while the agreement is in effect  we are required to deposit assets with a collective value  as defined in the line of credit agreement  equivalent to no less than of the outstanding principal balance 
amounts outstanding under the line of credit bear interest at either our choice of below the bank s prime rate or above the libor rate  depending on the payment schedule 
the line of credit agreement expires on september  we did not borrow under this line of credit during fiscal year as a result  there were no limitations on our deposited assets 
cash provided by used in operating activities 
the use of million of cash for operations during fiscal year was primarily attributable to increased working capital other than cash 
reductions in accounts payable and accrued payroll  and the increase in accounts receivable combined for a net million use of cash 
the reduction in trade payables related to the timing of inventory purchases and the decline in accrued payroll associated to reduced estimates for bonus and commissions 
the increase in accounts receivable related to higher sales late in the quarter over the prior year 
during the next months the balance of these accounts should remain approximately the same or increase slightly 
this was offset by net profit  which after non cash adjustments for depreciation  tax benefits  and inventory reserves generated  of cash flow 
additionally  of cash was provided by reductions to prepaid expenses and other assets 
this was attributed to the rescheduling of insurance policy renewals to into fiscal year during fiscal year million of cash was provided by operating activities 
net profit less non cash adjustments for depreciation  tax benefits  and the loss on the sale of wellcheck in total provided million  which was offset by a million use of cash for increases in inventories  account receivables and prepaid expenses 
additionally   was also consumed by decreased accrued payroll and related benefits 
cash used in investing activities 
spending on enhancements to manufacturing equipment  software  computers and leasehold improvements accounted for million of capital improvements during fiscal year additionally  we made a million net purchase of marketable securities during the year 
during fiscal year we made a net purchase of million of marketable securities and purchased million of plant  property and equipment 
during fiscal year  we intend to 
table of contents invest approximately million in capital purchases related to expansion of our manufacturing capacity  research and development  computer systems and tenant improvements 
cash provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for both fiscal year and relate to the issuance of common stock pursuant to the employee stock incentive and employee stock purchase plans 
during fiscal year we raised million and in fiscal year we raised million from the two programs 
the amount raised in the future will depend on the market value of our common stock  the prices of the incentive options and the purchase price relating to the employee stock purchase plan 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than more than no specific payments due by perid year years years years date total operating lease obligations purchase obligations other obligations total this represents the minimum payments due under lease obligations 
this represents the amount payable to certain of our officers if terminated for other than for cause 
the amount is not identified with a specific date due to the fact the amounts are only payable at termination 
we expect that cash generated from our projected revenue  existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will enable us to maintain our current and planned core operations for at least the next months 
excluding the roche settlement in fiscal year  we have achieved positive net cash provided from operations for fiscal years through and we expect to continue to generate cash from operations for the foreseeable future 
in our efforts to grow  we are seeking to acquire technologies which could complement our current product offering 
at this point  we have not found or targeted such technologies for purchase 
however  should we acquire such technologies  in connection with such acquisitions we may need to use a significant amount of cash which could cause us to need to raise funds from debt or equity offerings 
in the event that we would need additional financing for the operation of our business  we can draw upon our existing million line of credit which would require us to maintain cash and investments as collateral 
however  we may be required to finance any additional requirements through additional equity  debt financing or credit facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing or credit facilities  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors

the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is pervasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has transferred to our customers  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
provisions for discounts to customers  returns or other adjustments are recorded as a reduction of revenue and provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon analyses of historical discounts and returns 
we recognize revenue associated with 
table of contents services upon completion of the services to be performed under contract when all obligations are satisfied  and collection is reasonably assured 
if all conditions to recognize revenue are not met  we are required to defer revenue recognition 
allowance for bad debts we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for an estimated amount of losses that may result from a customer s inability to pay for product purchased 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in the past  reserves  adjustments to reserve estimates and write offs have not been significant 
inventory valuation we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using standard costs which approximates the first in  first out fifo method 
we establish provisions for excess  obsolete and unusable inventories after evaluation of historical sales  forecasted sales  product expiration and current inventory levels 
we charge to cost of revenue the increase to the provision for excess  obsolete and unusable inventory  the charge was   and  in fiscal year  fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
if the market value of our products decline  the demand for our products decline or if a significant amount of the material were to become unusable  our operating results could be adversely affected 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we continually review our deferred tax asset to determine if a valuation allowance is required  primarily based on estimates of future taxable income 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a valuation allowance and an expense in the period of the change 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and comply with the disclosure provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the pro forma disclosure of the difference between compensation expense included in net income loss and the related cost measured by the fair value method is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
if we were to include the cost of stock based employee compensation in the financial statements  our operating results would decline based on the fair value of the stock based employee compensation 
the fair market value used to determine the amount of compensation is based on several estimates including expected stock volatility  expected life of grant  expected employee turnover

factors affecting future operating results we have a history of operating losses and fluctuating operating results  which may result in the market price of our common stock declining our revenue and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our first profitable quarter was the third quarter of fiscal year  and our first profitable year was fiscal year we recorded a net profit of million for fiscal year  a net profit of million for fiscal year and a net profit of million for fiscal year the following are some of the factors that could cause our revenue  operating results and margins to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter the timing and level of market acceptance of the ldx system and the gdx system  manufacturing problems  efficiencies  capacity constraints or delays  the timing of the introduction  availability and market acceptance of new tests and products  changes in demand for our products based on changes in third party reimbursement policies  changes in government regulation and other factors  product pricing and discounts  the timing and level of expenditures associated with research and development activities  the timing  establishment and maintenance of strategic distribution arrangements and the success of the activities conducted under such arrangements  the timing of significant orders from  and shipments to  customers  competition from diagnostic companies with greater financial capital and resources  costs and timing associated with business development activities  including potential licensing of technologies or intellectual property rights  
table of contents additions or departures of our key personnel  promotional program spending by both domestic and european pharmaceutical companies  variations in the mix of products sold  and litigation or the threat of litigation 
these and other factors are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly demand for our products may cause our manufacturing operations to fluctuate in volume  increase uncertainty in operational planning and or affect cash flows from operations 
we commit to many of our expenses in advance  based on our expectations of future business needs 
these costs are largely fixed in the short term 
as a result  when business levels do not meet expectations  our fixed costs will not be recovered and we will experience losses 
this situation is likely to result in the future because of the variability and unpredictability of our revenue 
this also means that our results will likely not meet the expectations of public market security analysts or investors at one time or another  which may result in the market price of our common stock declining 
our business depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology through patents and other means and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others our success depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we have nine united states patents  one german patent and have filed patent applications relating to our technology internationally under the patent cooperation treaty and individual foreign patent applications 
the risks of relying on the proprietary nature of our technology include our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents  or  if issued  such patents may not offer protection against competitors with similar technology  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future  and the rights created under our patents may not provide a competitive advantage  competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than us and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for and obtain patents covering technologies that are more effective than ours 
this could render our technologies or products obsolete or uncompetitive or could prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products either in the united states or in international markets  the medical products industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

table of contents we may in the future become subject to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings conducted in the united states patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions 
litigation may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued to us  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  patent interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming and will likely result in substantially diverting the attention of technical and management personnel from our business operations 
we may also be subject to significant damages or equitable remedies regarding the development and sale of our products and operation of our business 
for example  in fiscal year  we entered into a settlement agreement and license agreement with roche  which settled all existing patent litigation between the parties on a worldwide basis 
the settlement included a lump sum payment by us to roche in the amount of million and the dismissal of all patent claims between the parties 
as a part of the settlement  we will pay roche an ongoing royalty and roche will grant an irrevocable  non exclusive  worldwide license to us for its patents related to hdl cholesterol 
in addition  the parties have also agreed upon a mechanism for the resolution of future patent infringement disputes 
we believe that any such dispute resolution will confirm that our hdl cholesterol test cassette  currently under development  does not infringe roche s patents 
if however  upon the resolution of any such dispute  it is ultimately determined that our new hdl cholesterol test cassette is covered by roche s patents  we will pay roche the same ongoing royalty 
we rely on trade secrets  technical know how and continuing invention to develop and maintain our competitive position 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology 
we may also be unable to adequately protect our trade secrets  or be capable of protecting our rights to our trade secrets 
we depend on technology that we license from others  which may not be available to us in the future and would prevent us from introducing new products and harm our business our current products incorporate technologies that are the subject of patents issued to  and patent applications filed by  others 
we have obtained licenses for certain of these technologies 
we may in the future be required to negotiate to obtain licenses for new products 
some of our current licenses are subject to rights of termination and may be terminated 
our licensors may not abide by their contractual obligations and  as a result  may limit the benefits we currently derive from their licenses 
we may be unable to renegotiate or obtain licenses for technology patented by others on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we also may be unable to develop alternative approaches if we are unable to obtain licenses 
our future licenses may also not be adequate for the operation of our business 
failure to obtain  maintain or enforce necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or to identify and implement alternative approaches could prevent us from introducing our products and severely harm our business 
our stock price has been highly volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors the market price of our common stock has in the past been  and in the future is likely to be  highly volatile 
for example  between march  and march   the price of our common stock  as reported on the nasdaq national market system  has ranged from a low of to a high of 
table of contents 
these fluctuations could result in substantial losses for investors 
our stock price may fluctuate for a number of reasons including quarterly variations in our operating results  litigation or threat of litigation  developments in or disputes regarding patent or other proprietary rights  announcements of technological or competitive developments by us and our competitors  regulatory developments regarding us or our competitors  changes in the current structure of the healthcare financing and payment systems  our failure to achieve  or changes in  financial estimates by securities analysts and comments or opinions about us by securities analysts or major shareholders  stock market price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for medical products and high technology companies and which are often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies  and general economic  political and market conditions 
with the advent of the internet  new avenues have been created for the dissemination of information 
we do not have control over the information that is distributed and discussed on electronic bulletin boards and investment chat rooms 
the motives of the people or organizations that distribute such information may not be in our best interest or in the interest of our shareholders 
this  in addition to other forms of investment information  including newsletters and research publications  could result in a significant decline in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  stock markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices for diagnostic product companies have been affected by these market fluctuations and such effects have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause a decline in the market price of our common stock 
securities class action litigation is often brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its stock 
this type of litigation has been brought against us in the past and could be brought against us in the future  which could result in substantial expense and damage awards and divert management s attention from running our business 
if third party reimbursement for use of our products is eliminated or reduced  our sales will be greatly reduced and our business may fail in the united states  healthcare providers that purchase products such as the ldx system and the gdx system generally rely on their patients healthcare insurers  including private health insurance plans  federal medicare  state medicaid and managed care organizations  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the product is being used 
we will be unable to successfully market our products if their purchase and use is not subject to reimbursement from government health authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors 
if this reimbursement is not available or is limited  
table of contents healthcare providers will be much less likely to use our products  our sales will be greatly reduced and our business may fail 
there are current conditions in the healthcare industry that increase the possibility that third party payors may reduce or eliminate reimbursement for tests using our products in certain settings 
these conditions include third party payors are increasingly scrutinizing and challenging the prices charged for both existing and new medical products and services  healthcare providers are moving toward a system in which employers are requiring participants to bear a greater burden of the cost of their healthcare benefits which could result in fewer elective procedures  such as the use of our products for diagnostic screening  general uncertainty regarding what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by third party payors and how that will affect the use of products such as ours  which may deter healthcare providers from adopting the use of our products  and an overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to and will continue to lead to increased pressures on the healthcare industry  both domestic and international  to reduce the cost of products and services  including products offered by us 
market acceptance of our products in international markets is also dependent  in part  on the availability of reimbursement or funding  as the case may be  within prevailing healthcare systems 
reimbursement  funding and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance 
third party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the united states or international markets  and current reimbursement or funding amounts may be decreased in the future 
also  future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors may adversely affect demand for our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
any of these events could materially harm our business 
if the healthcare system in the united states undergoes fundamental change  these changes may harm our business we believe that the healthcare industry in the united states is likely to undergo fundamental changes due to current political  economic and regulatory influences 
we anticipate that congress  state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems 
potential alternatives include mandated basic healthcare benefits  controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and medicare and medicaid spending  the creation of large insurance purchasing groups  price controls and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system 
we expect legislative debate to continue in the future and for market forces to demand reduced costs 
we cannot predict what impact the adoption of any federal or state healthcare reform measures  future private sector reform or market forces may have on our business 
any changes in the healthcare system could potentially have extremely negative effects on our business 

table of contents we depend on distributors to sell our products and failure to successfully maintain these relationships could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue to increase revenue and achieve sustained profitability  we will have to successfully maintain our existing distribution relationships and develop new distribution relationships 
we depend on our distributors to assist us in promoting market acceptance of the ldx system and the gdx system 
however  we may be unable to enter into and maintain new arrangements on a timely basis  or at all 
even if we do enter into additional distributor relationships  those distributors may not devote the resources necessary to provide effective sales and marketing support to our products 
in addition  our distributors sell products offered by our competitors 
if our competitors offer our distributors more favorable terms or have more products available to meet their needs or utilize the leverage of broader product lines sold through the distributor  those distributors may de emphasize or decline to carry our products 
in addition  our distributors order decision making process is complex and involves several factors  including end user demand  warehouse allocation and marketing resources  which can make it difficult to accurately predict total sales for the quarter until late in the quarter 
in order to keep our products included in distributors marketing programs  in the past we have provided promotional goods or made short term pricing concessions 
the discontinuation of promotional goods or pricing concessions could have a negative effect on our business 
our distributors could also modify their business practices  such as payment terms  inventory levels or order patterns 
for example  as part of our practice of providing periodic promotional incentives to our distribution partners  we have historically offered small discounts from standard distributor pricing to such partners in connection with large unit volume purchases 
throughout the course of fiscal year  we experienced increasing demand by our distribution partners to purchase at such discounts toward the end of each quarter 
we became increasingly concerned about the future impact on end user pricing and the inefficiencies in our operations that result from month to month swings in shipping volume 
as a result  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we decided to reduce the amount of product we sold to our distribution partners at a discount to their standard price  which had an adverse impact on our operating results 
if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with distributors or expand our distribution channels or we experience unexpected changes in payment terms  inventory levels or other practices by our distributors  our business will suffer 
we may be unable to accurately predict future sales through our distributors  which could harm our ability to efficiently manage our internal resources to match market demand our product sales are primarily made through our network of over domestic and international distributors 
as a result  our financial results  quarterly product sales  trends and comparisons are affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of end user customers and our distributors  and by the changes in inventory levels of our products held by these distributors 
we have only limited visibility over the inventory levels of our products held by our domestic and international distributors 
while we attempt to assist our distributors in maintaining targeted stocking level of our products  we may not consistently be accurate or successful 
this process involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties including end user customer demand  and the reaction of our distributors to our new quarterly pricing policy 
consequently  actual results could differ from our estimates 
inventory levels of our products held by our distributors may exceed or fall below the levels we consider desirable on a going forward basis  which may harm our financial results due to unexpected 
table of contents buying patterns of our distributors or our ability to efficiently manage or invest in internal resources  such as manufacturing and shipping capacity  to meet the actual demand for our products 
we may be unable to effectively compete against other providers of diagnostic products  which could cause our sales to decline the market for diagnostic products in which we operate is intensely competitive 
our business is based on the sale of diagnostic products that physicians and other healthcare providers can administer in their own facilities without sending samples to laboratories 
thus  our competition consists primarily of clinical reference laboratories and hospital based laboratories that use automated testing systems  as well as manufacturers of other rapid diagnostic tests 
to achieve and maintain market acceptance for the ldx system and the gdx system  we must demonstrate that the ldx system and the gdx system are cost effective and time saving alternatives to other rapid diagnostic tests as well as to clinical and hospital laboratories 
even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost effective and save time  physicians and other healthcare providers may resist changing their established source of such tests 
the ldx system and the gdx system may be unable to compete with these other testing services and analyzers 
in addition  companies with a significant presence in the market for clinical diagnostics  such as abbott laboratories  bayer diagnostics  beckman coulter  inc  and roche diagnostics a subsidiary of roche holdings  ltd 
have developed or are developing analyzers designed for point of care testing 
these competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than us 
these competitors also offer broader product lines than us  have greater name recognition than us and offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
in addition  several smaller companies  including polymer technology systems  inc are currently making or developing products that compete or will compete with ours 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
even if we do have such resources and capabilities  we may not employ them successfully 
our ldx system and gdx system have not yet achieved broad market acceptance in all of our target markets and if broad market acceptance does not occur  our operating results will be harmed our ldx system  including the ldx analyzer and single use test cassettes  currently accounts for substantially all of the revenue of our business 
if this revenue does not grow  our overall business will be severely harmed 
in addition  we have limited experience marketing and distributing the gdx system  and it is uncertain whether this product will achieve broad market acceptance in our target markets and generate significant revenue in the future 
for us to increase revenue  sustain profitability and maintain positive cash flows from operations  the ldx system and the gdx system must continue to and begin to gain market acceptance among healthcare providers  particularly physician office laboratories 
we have made only limited sales of the ldx system to physician office laboratories to date relative to the size of the available market 
factors that could prevent broad market acceptance of the ldx system and the gdx system include low levels of awareness of the availability of our technology in both the physician and other customer groups  the availability and pricing of other testing alternatives  
table of contents a decrease in the amount of reimbursement for performing tests on the ldx system and the gdx system 
many managed care organizations have contracts with laboratories  which require participating or employed physicians to send patient specimens to contracted laboratories  and physicians are under growing pressure by medicare and other third party payors to limit their testing to medically necessary tests 
if our ldx system does not achieve broader market acceptance and our gdx system does not achieve favorable market acceptance  our business will not grow 
even if we are successful in continuing to place our ldx analyzer at physician office laboratories and other near patient testing sites and marketing our gdx system  there can be no assurance that placement of these products will result in sustained demand for our single use test cassettes and single use test cartridges 
in addition  we must leverage our installed base of systems in order to increase the sales of our single use test cassettes and single use test cartridges 
if we are unable to increase the usage of cassettes on our current installed base  we will have to identify new customers and induce them to purchase an analyzer  which requires more time and effort and has a significantly larger purchase price than the single use test cassettes 
as a result of these many hurdles to achieving broad market acceptance for the ldx system and the gdx system  demand may not be sufficient to sustain revenue and profits from operations 
because the ldx system currently contributes the vast majority of our revenue  and we expect the gdx system to contribute a portion of our revenue in the future  we could be required to cease operations if the ldx system and the gdx system do not achieve and maintain a significant level of market acceptance 
if we do not successfully develop  acquire or form alliances to introduce and market new tests and products  our future business will be harmed we believe our business will not grow significantly if we do not develop  acquire or form alliances for new tests and products to use in conjunction with the ldx system and the gdx system 
if we do not develop market and introduce new tests and products to the market  our business will not grow significantly and will be harmed 
developing new tests involves many significant problems and risks  including research and development is a very expensive process  research and development takes a very long time to result in a marketable product  significant costs including diversion of resources may be incurred in development before knowing if the development will result in a test that is commercially viable  a new test will not be successful unless it is effectively marketed to its target market  the manufacturing process for a new test must be reliable  cost efficient and high volume and must be developed and implemented in a timely manner to produce the test for sale  
table of contents new tests must meet a significant market need to be successful  and new tests must obtain proper regulatory approvals to be marketed 
we could experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new tests and products 
for example  regulatory clearance or approval of any new tests or products may not be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
we have experienced difficulties obtaining regulatory approval for tests in the past 
because the evaluation of applications by the fda for clia waived status is not based on precisely defined  objectively measurable criteria  we cannot predict the likelihood of obtaining clia waived status for future products 
in addition  our business strategy includes entering into agreements with clinical and commercial collaborators and other third parties for the development  clinical evaluation and marketing of existing products and products under development 
these agreements may be subject to rights of termination and may be terminated without our consent 
the parties to these agreements also may not abide by their contractual obligations to us and may discontinue or sell their current lines of business 
research performed under a collaboration for which we receive or provide funding may not lead to the development of products in the timeframe expected  or at all 
if these agreements are terminated earlier than expected  or if third parties do not perform their obligations to us properly and on a timely basis  we may not be able to successfully develop new products as planned  or at all 
we face risks from failures in our manufacturing processes we manufacture all of the single use test cassettes that are used with the ldx analyzer 
the manufacture of single use test cassettes is a highly complex and precise process that is sensitive to a wide variety of factors 
significant additional resources  implementation of additional manufacturing equipment or changes in our manufacturing processes have been  and may continue to be  required for the scaling up of each new product prior to commercialization or in order to meet increasing customer demand once commercialization begins  and this work may not be completed successfully or efficiently 
in the past  we have experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields that have adversely affected gross margins and delayed product shipments 
if we do not maintain acceptable manufacturing yields of test cassettes or experience product shipment delays  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we may reject or be unable to sell a substantial percentage of test cassettes because of raw materials variations or impurities  human error  manufacturing process variances and impurities  and decreased manufacturing equipment performance 
our ldx manufacturing equipment and cassette manufacturing lines would be costly and time consuming to repair or replace if their operation were interrupted 
the interruption of our manufacturing operations or the loss of associates dedicated to the manufacturing facility could severely harm our business 
the risks involving our manufacturing lines include as our production levels have increased  we could be required to use our machinery more hours per day and the down time resulting from equipment failure could increase  
table of contents the custom nature of much of our manufacturing equipment increases the time required to remedy equipment failures and replace equipment  we have a limited number of associates dedicated to the operation and maintenance of our manufacturing equipment  the loss of whom could impact our ability to effectively operate and service such equipment  we manufacture all of our cassettes at our hayward  california manufacturing facility  so manufacturing operations are at risk to interruption from earthquake  fire  power outages or other events affecting this one location  and our new manufacturing line is operating at production capability 
our failure to maintain production levels and operate this line at production capability for an extended period would impact our ability to increase our manufacturing capacity 
our operating results may suffer if we do not reduce our manufacturing costs we believe we will be required to reduce manufacturing costs for new and existing test cassettes to achieve sustained profitability 
we currently manufacture the majority of our dry chemistry cassettes on a single production line 
a second manufacturing line is currently used for overflow production and for research and development purposes 
the complexity and custom nature of our manufacturing process increases the amount of time and money required to add an additional manufacturing line 
in addition  we may need to implement additional cassette manufacturing cost reduction programs 
failure to maintain full production levels for our new manufacturing line could prevent us from satisfying customer orders in a timely manner  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of business and a failure to reduce manufacturing costs for dry chemistry tests  which could prevent us from achieving sustained profitability 
our future results could be harmed by economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with international sales historically  a significant portion of our total revenue has been generated outside of the united states 
international revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was approximately in fiscal year and in fiscal year we anticipate that international revenue will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
our revenue is generally denominated in united states dollars  however  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and  as a result  our future revenue from international operations may be unpredictable 
we make foreign currency denominated purchases related to our gdx system in the united kingdom 
this exposes us to risks associated with currency exchange fluctuations 
to minimize this risk  we have undertaken certain foreign currency hedging transactions  however  weakening of the dollar could make the cost of the gdx system less competitive in the domestic market  resulting in less predictable domestic revenue 
in addition to foreign currency risks  our international sales and operations may also be subject to the following risks our dependency on pharmaceutical companies promotional programs as a primary source of international revenue  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
table of contents the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging nations  less effective protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  changes in tariffs and other trade protection measures  difficulties in managing international operations  and potential insolvency of international distributors and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods 
if we are unable to minimize the foregoing risks  they may harm our current and future international sales and  consequently  our business 
we depend on single source suppliers for certain materials used in our manufacturing process and failure of our suppliers to provide materials to us could harm our business we currently depend on single source vendors to provide certain subassemblies  components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products 
we also depend on a third party manufacturer for the gdx system 
any supply interruption in a single sourced material or product could restrict our ability to manufacture and distribute products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified 
we may not be successful in qualifying additional sources of supply on a timely basis  or at all 
failure to obtain a usable alternative source or product could prevent us from manufacturing and distributing our products  resulting in inability to fill orders  customer dissatisfaction and loss of business 
this would likely severely harm our business 
in addition  an uncorrected impurity or supplier s variation in material  either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process  could interfere with our ability to manufacture and distribute products 
because we are a small customer of many of our suppliers and we purchase their subassemblies  components and materials with purchase orders instead of long term commitments  our suppliers may not devote adequate resources to supplying our needs 
any interruption or reduction in the future supply of any materials currently obtained from single or limited sources could severely harm our business 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial part of our revenue sales to a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in each fiscal period 
we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue in future periods 
our top ten customers comprised of our revenue in fiscal year in fiscal year  physicians sales and service pss accounted for approximately of our total revenue  henry schein inc henry schein accounted for approximately and mckesson medical surgical mckesson accounted for of our total revenue 
in fiscal year  pss accounted for approximately of our total revenue  mckesson accounting for of our total revenue  and henry schein accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
we have experienced periods in which sales to some of our major customers  as a percentage of total revenue  have fluctuated due to delays or failures to place expected orders 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our customers  who generally purchase our products pursuant to cancelable short term purchase orders 
if we were to lose a major customer or if orders by or shipments to a major customer were to otherwise decrease or be delayed  our operating results would be harmed 

table of contents recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations will increase our costs the sarbanes oxley act of along with other recent and proposed rules from the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq require changes in our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
many of these new requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs  and make some corporate actions more difficult  such as proposing new or amendments to stock option plans  which now require shareholder approval 
these developments could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments also could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
our products are subject to multiple levels of government regulation and any regulatory changes are difficult to predict and may be damaging to our business the manufacture and sale of our diagnostic products  including the ldx system and the gdx system  is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
we are unable to commence marketing or commercial sales in the united states of any of the new tests we develop until we receive the required clearances and approvals 
the process of obtaining required regulatory clearances and approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
as a result  our new tests under development  even if successfully developed  may never obtain such clearance or approval 
additionally  certain material changes to products that have already been cleared or approved are subject to further review and clearance or approval 
medical devices are subject to continual review  and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a cleared product may result in restrictions on the product s marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market 
if we lose previously obtained clearances  or fail to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements  we may be unable to market the affected products  which would depress our revenue and severely harm our business 
in addition  any future amendment or addition to regulations impacting our products could prevent us from marketing the ldx system and the gdx system 
regulatory changes could hurt our business by increasing burdens on our products or by reducing or eliminating certain competitive advantages of the ldx system s and the gdx system s waived status 
food and drug administration clearance or approval of products such as ours can be obtained by either of two processes the k clearance process  which generally takes from four to months but may take longer  and the pre market approval process  which is a longer and more costly process than a k clearance process  involves the submission of extensive supporting data and clinical information and generally takes one to three years but may take significantly longer 
if our future products are required to obtain a pre market approval  this would significantly delay our ability to market those tests and significantly increase the costs of development 

table of contents the use of our products and those of our competitors is also affected by federal and state regulations  which provide for regulation of laboratory testing  as well as by the laws and regulations of foreign countries 
the scope of these regulations includes quality control  proficiency testing  personnel standards and inspections 
in the united states  clinical laboratory testing is regulated under the clinical laboratory improvement act of the ldx analyzer  our total cholesterol  high density lipoproteins  triglycerides and glucose tests in any combination  our alt test cassette  the gdx analyzer and ac test cartridges have been classified as waived from the application of many of the requirements under the clia 
we believe this waived classification is critical for our products to be successful in their domestic markets 
any failure of our new tests to obtain waived status under the clia will severely limit our ability to commercialize such tests 
loss of waived status for existing diagnostic products or failure to obtain waived status for new products could limit our revenue from sales of such products  which would severely harm our business 
we may face fines or our manufacturing facilities could be closed if we fail to comply with manufacturing and environmental regulations our manufacturing processes and  in certain instances  those of our contract manufacturers  are subject to stringent federal  state and local regulations governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in many things  including warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant pre market clearance or pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution 
any of these developments could harm our business 
we and our contract manufacturers are also subject to federal  state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture of healthcare products and diagnostic devices  including quality system regulations  which requires manufacturers to be in compliance with food and drug administration regulations  iso en requirements  which is an industry standard for maintaining and assuring conformance to quality standards  and other foreign regulations and state and local health  safety and environmental regulations  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
changes in existing regulations or adoption of new governmental regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products or require us to incur significant costs to comply with manufacturing and environmental regulations  which could harm our business 
although in recent times there have been signs of a general economic upturn in the united states  it is uncertain as to how strongly this upturn may impact our markets over the next year the primary customers for our products are physician office laboratories and entities conducting health promotion programs 
beginning in  a general economic downturn in the united states reduced demand for our products and our customers capital spending in most of the markets that we serve 
this general economic downturn continued through but has stabilized throughout however  it is uncertain as to how strongly this general economic upturn may impact the markets we 
table of contents serve over the next year and whether the upturn can be sustained 
overall  our customers spending decisions are still being closely scrutinized 
any future significant downturn in domestic or global economic conditions which results in the reduction of the capital spending budgets of our customers or a delay in capital equipment purchases would again likely result in a decline in demand for our products and could adversely affect our business 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions which could have an adverse impact on our business if they are unsuccessful we continue to evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and we may pursue product  technology or business acquisitions 
these acquisitions could be very costly  could result in dilution to existing investors and could result in integration problems that harm our business as a whole 
any acquisition could result in expending significant amounts of cash  issuing potentially dilutive equity securities or incurring debt or unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business 
in addition  our acquisitions may not be successful in achieving our desired strategic objectives  which could materially harm our operating results and business 
acquisitions may also result in difficulties in assimilating the operations  technologies  products  services and personnel of the acquired company or business or in achieving the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated 
these difficulties could result in additional expenses  diversion of management attention and an inability to respond quickly to market issues 
any of these results could harm us financially 
if we are successful in growing sales  our business will be harmed if we cannot effectively manage the operational and management challenges of growth if we are successful in achieving and maintaining market acceptance for the ldx system and the gdx system  we will be required to expand our operations  particularly in the areas of sales  marketing and manufacturing 
as we expand our operations  this expansion will likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain on our management  operating and financial systems and resources 
to accommodate any such growth and compete effectively  we will be required to implement and improve our information systems  procedures and controls  and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to implement and improve operational  financial and management systems or to manage our work force as required by future growth  if any  could harm our business and prevent us from improving our financial condition as a result of increased sales 
our business could be negatively affected by the loss of key personnel or our inability to hire qualified personnel our success depends in significant part on the continued service of certain key scientific  technical  regulatory and managerial personnel 
our success will also require us to continue to identify  attract  hire and retain additional highly qualified personnel in those areas 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our industry 
we may be unable to retain our key personnel or attract or retain other necessary highly qualified personnel in the future  which would harm the development of our business 

table of contents product liability and professional liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation  payment of substantial damages and an increase in our insurance rates sale and use of our products and the past performance of testing services by our formerly wholly owned subsidiary could lead to the filing of a product liability or professional liability claim 
if any of these claims are brought  we may have to expend significant resources defending against them 
if we are found liable for any of these claims  we may have to pay damages that could severely hurt our financial position 
loss of these claims could also hurt our reputation  resulting in our losing business and market share 
the medical testing industry has historically been litigious  and we face financial exposure to these liability claims if use of our products results in personal injury or improper diagnosis 
we also face the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of our products might necessitate a product recall 
we currently maintain product liability insurance and professional liability insurance for claims relating to the past performance of testing services  but there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate 
insurance is expensive and difficult to obtain  and we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability 
inability to maintain insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability could prevent or inhibit the continued commercialization of our products 
in addition  a product liability or professional liability claim in excess of relevant insurance coverage or a product recall could severely harm our financial condition 
we may need additional capital in the future to support our growth  and such additional funds may not be available to us we intend to expend substantial funds for capital expenditures and working capital related to research and development  expansion of sales and marketing activities and other working capital and general corporate purposes 
although we believe our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash flow anticipated to be generated by future operations and available bank borrowings under an existing line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future  we may still require additional financing 
for example  we may be required to expend greater than anticipated funds if unforeseen difficulties arise in expanding manufacturing capacity for existing cassettes or in the course of completing required additional development  obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  obtaining waived status under clia or introducing or scaling up manufacturing for new tests 
if we need additional capital in the future  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our existing shareholders or have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders 
if we raise additional capital through borrowings  the terms of such borrowings may impose limitations on how our management may operate the business in the future 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could prevent us from developing our products and our business 

table of contents we have made use of a device to limit the possibility that we are acquired  which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders 
to date  our board of directors has designated  shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our poison pill anti takeover plan 
the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of our company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock 
the poison pill may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
the poison pill may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation  purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the poison pill 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures our exposure to market risks is inherent in our operations  primarily to interest rates relating to our investment portfolio 
we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents  available for sale marketable securities and any future financing requirements 
interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by managing maturities in our marketable securities portfolio 
generally we hold our marketable securities until maturity 
these securities have maturity dates that do not exceed fiscal year and have predominately fixed interest rates 
we have concluded that the income on our investments would not be significantly impacted by short term changes in interest rates 
when the securities mature and the principal is reinvested  the yield will reflect the market conditions at that time 
fluctuations in short term interest rates may change the fair market value of our investments  however  as the marketable securities approach maturity  the fair value will approximate our cost basis 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exposures arising from inventory purchases and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 
our policy is to hedge of all committed purchase contracts and a lesser percentage for forecasted purchases 
as of march   we had outstanding forward contracts to purchase  for approximately  the open contracts mature at various dates through july  and hedge certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in the british pound sterling 
the unrealized gain on the forward contracts as of march  was  all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings within the next months 
there was no gain or loss recorded in the period from hedge ineffectiveness or from forecasted transactions no longer expected to occur 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 
we do not expect gains or losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results 

table of contents the following table presents the future principal cash flows or amount and related weighted average interest rates expected by year for our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments 
fiscal year total fair value in thousands cash  cash equivalents short term marketable securities weighted average interest rate long term marketable securities weighted average interest rate qualitative disclosures our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to available for sale securities will fall in value if market interest rates increase  and the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations 
we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect the operating results or cash flows to be affected to a significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and long term marketable securities portfolio
