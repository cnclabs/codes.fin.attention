item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this document 
overview the company designs  develops  markets and supports portable  software driven  d measurement systems that are used in a broad range of manufacturing and industrial applications 
the company s principal products are the faro arm and faro gage articulated arm measuring devices  the faro laser tracker  a laser based measuring device and their companion cam software  which provide for cad based inspection and factory level statistical process control 
together  these products integrate the measurement and quality inspection function with cad software to improve productivity  enhance product quality and decrease rework and scrap in the manufacturing process 
the company s products bring precision measurement  quality inspection and specification conformance capabilities  integrated with leading cad software  to the factory floor 
the company is a pioneer in the development and marketing of d measurement technology in manufacturing and industrial applications and currently holds patents 
the company s products have been purchased by approximately  customers worldwide  ranging from small machine shops to such large manufacturing and industrial companies as audi  bell helicopter  boeing  british aerospace  caterpillar  daimlerchrysler  general electric  general motors  honda  johnson controls  komatsu dresser  lockheed martin  siemens and volkswagen among many others 
in  the company made a strategic decision to target international markets 
the company established sales offices in france and germany in  great britain in  japan and spain in  italy in  and china in international sales represented   and of sales in   and  respectively 
the company expects higher percentage sales growth in the asia pacific region than other regions in and as a result of opening its china sales office  and the addition of sales personnel and the opening of a service center in its japan organization 
the company derives revenues primarily from the sale of its faro arm and faro laser tracker d measurement equipment  and its related multi faceted cam software 
going forward  the company also expects to generate revenue from the sale of its new faro gage product 
revenue related to these products is recognized upon shipment 
in addition  the company sells one  two and three year maintenance contracts and training and technology consulting services relating to its products 
the company recognizes the revenue from extended maintenance contracts proportionately  in the same manner as costs are incurred for such revenues 
the company also receives royalties from licensing agreements for its historical medical technology and recognizes the revenue from these royalties as licensees report use of the technology 
in royalties from licensing agreements were  or of total sales 
in the company began to manufacture its faro arm products in switzerland for customer orders from europe and asia 
it will begin to manufacture its faro laser tracker and faro gage products in its swiss plant by mid the production of these products for customer orders from the americas will be done in the company s headquarters in florida  and its manufacturing plant in pennsylvania 
the company expects all its existing plants to provide the necessary capacity for its growth  at least through cost of sales consists primarily of material  production overhead and labor 
since the company s ipo in it has had gross margin in the range 
the company expects to maintain gross margin at or near going forward 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions to sales and marketing personnel  and promotion  advertising  travel and telecommunications 
selling expenses as a percentage of sales dropped significantly in as compared to  to from and holding selling expenses as a percentage of sales to or less will be a long term goal of the company  although the addition of new sales personnel in asia may temporarily cause a rise in selling expenses as a percentage of sales in until these new sales people are fully trained and productive 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for administrative personnel  rent  utilities and professional and legal expenses 
the company expects general and administrative expenses to drop as a percentage of sales as higher sales should not require a proportionate increase in these expenses 
research and development expenses represent salaries  equipment and third party services 
the company has a commitment to ongoing research and development and intends to continue to fund these efforts at the level of of sales going forward 
the company has received a favorable income tax rate commitment from the swiss government as an incentive for the company to establish a manufacturing plant there 
as a result the company expects its blended consolidated tax rate to be in a range between and of consolidated taxable income for at least and accounting for wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is maintained in the currency of the respective foreign jurisdiction and  therefore  fluctuations in exchange rates may have an impact on inter company accounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company is aware of off balance sheet financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  including cross currency swaps  forward contracts  and foreign currency options see foreign exchange exposure below 
however the company does not regularly use such instruments 
during fiscal years and  the company s sales growth was adversely affected by the economic slowdown  which began in in the united states and europe 
this effect  however  was offset by sales growth resulting from the acquisition in january of spatialmetrix corporation smx  which manufactured the predecessor to the faro laser tracker  and the introduction in september and october of the latest generation of the company s traditional faro arm product 
in sales growth resulted primarily from strong customer response to the new faro arm and laser tracker products  and an increase in worldwide sales and marketing activities  including an increase in headcount from in to at the end of in the company recorded approximately million in other income as a result of recovering approximately  shares of company stock related to a positive arbitration settlement between the company and the former smx shareholders 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods presented  the percentage of sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations year ended december  statement of operations data sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling general and administrative depreciation and amortization research and development employee stock options total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income other income  net interest expense net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss compared to sales 
sales increased million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for year ended december  the increase resulted from higher unit sales of the faro arm and laser tracker products  an increase in headcount in sales and marketing from in to in  and from a average price increase on existing products on january  geographically  sales increased million or in the americas  million or in europe africa  and million  or in the asia pacific region 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  gross margin percentage increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  due to higher selling prices and efficiencies in laser tracker manufacturing plant output 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased by million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was a result of increased sales head count and higher commissions due to higher sales 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses dropped to of sales in from in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the increase in professional and legal fees  service charges and network costs 
general and administrative expenses as percentage of sales fell to of the sales in from of the sales in depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by  or  from million for the year ended december  to million in  due to a reduction in amortization of existing product technology of  offset by an increase of  in depreciation of new equipment 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due primarily to the increased subcontractor costs and materials 
the company plans to spend at least of sales on research and development 
employee stock option expenses 
employee stock option expenses increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due primarily to an increase in the price of the company s stock and the recording of expense in connection with certain stock options that are accounted for as variable options 
see also note stock compensation to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
interest income expense 
interest income decreased by  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  primarily from lower average investments and lower interest rates in interest expense increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to increased use of a credit line see liquidity and capital resources below 
other income 
other income increased by million from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due primarily to the settlement of litigation with the former shareholders of smx for million 
see also note acquisition 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased by  from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate in was of net income before income tax 
the primary reason for the relatively low tax rate was a reduction in valuation allowance of approximately million 
of that reduction  million relates to usage of net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions and million of the reduction in valuation allowance relates to domestic assets for which the company now believes are more likely than not to be realized 
the company has million in deferred tax assets remaining  which may be recognized in if the company remains consistently profitable 
see also note income taxes to the financial statements contained herein 
separate from income tax expenses  the company recorded an addition to shareholders equity of million for the income tax benefit received from the exercise of unqualified stock options by employees 
net income loss 
the results from operations increased by million from a loss of million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of the factors described above 
compared to sales 
sales increased by million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from sales of the new laser product line in geographically sales increased in all regions primarily due to sales of the new laser product line united states increased million or  europe increased million or  japan increased million or  other foreign sales increased  or 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
royalty income included in sales decreased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  gross profit 
gross profit increased by million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin was primarily a result of a one time inventory write down  recorded in the second quarter of related to the new laser product line  the impact of the new laser product line acquired in january and  to a lesser extent  the new generation arm products introduced in the third quarter of see new products above 
gross margins on sales are expected to ultimately meet or exceed the company s historic levels once both production facilities are at full production levels 
plant capacity utilization is expected to increase with additional manufacturing efficiencies expected in selling expenses 
selling expenses increased by  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was a result of higher sales commissions on higher sales in the us million and higher expenses in japan  offset largely by cost reduction measures implemented in the united states  and europe 
while an increase in total expenses was experienced in compared to  this amount represents a decrease in the percentage of sales from in to in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to administrative expenses resulting from the integration of the former smx in  professional fees unrelated to smx  a provision for doubtful accounts receivable  recorded in the second quarter of related to the recently acquired laser product line  and a shifting of personnel from research and development to administrative positions 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by  or  from million for the year ended december  to million in depreciation and amortization expenses in reflect the effect approximately  of the adoption  effective january   of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
partly offset by an increase in depreciation resulting from newly acquired assets in late see note to the consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  principally as a result of research and development expenses of the new laser tracker product line million offset in part by lower expenses for the new generation arm development in the us  and shifting of personnel to administrative positions costs in europe  see general and administrative expenses above 
interest income 
interest income decreased by  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest bearing cash balances see liquidity and capital resources below and lower interest rates prevailing in other income loss 
other income increased by  from  loss for the year ended december  to  in income for the year ended december  primarily due to foreign currency gains during the current year 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  net loss 
net loss decreased by  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to higher gross profit from increased sales and cost savings measures implemented in the us and europe  partially offset by integration expenses of the laser division and reduced income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources since  the company had financed its operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities and from the proceeds of its initial public offering of common stock approximately million 
on november  the company along with company s two co founders completed a million private placement of its common stock with various institutional investors 
in the private placement  the company sold  shares  or approximately of total shares outstanding  and the two co founders of the company  simon raab and gregory fraser  sold  shares  or approximately of their holdings  in the aggregate 
the shares were sold for per share  resulting in total proceeds before placement agent fees and other offering expenses of million and million to the company and the co founders  respectively 
on september   the company entered into a loan agreement with suntrust bank for a line of credit of million 
the company has not drawn on this line of credit 
total marketable securities cash and cash equivalents and investments at december  were million  compared to million at december  this million increase was primarily due to the million private placement on november  described above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to net cash used by operating activities of million in the million increase reflects strong growth in sales and operating income  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  taxes  and unearned revenue and the other income realized in company stock in the settlement of the smx litigation 
net cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to  in primarily due to increased net investment purchases of million 
net cash provided by the financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to a provision of million in the increase was primarily the proceeds of the million private placement of the company common stock in november we believe that our working capital  together with anticipated cash flow from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
our liquidity is not dependant upon the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to capital through special purpose entities 
on january   in connection with its acquisition of smx  the company issued  shares of faro common stock to the former shareholders 
on september  the company settled a dispute with the former smx shareholders  which resulted in approximately  shares being returned from the  initially issued in the acquisition 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company is a party to a capital lease of  and a party to automotive and other equipment with an initial term of to months and other non cancelable operating leases  including leases with related parties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements that expire on or before commitments under the lease agreements are as follows at december  payments due under capital operating year leases leases total thereafter total future minimum lease payments    critical accounting policies in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected our most subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimate in addition to any inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects on the company s financial condition 
the two accounting estimation processes discussed below are the company s process of recognizing research and development expenditures  and the allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
these estimation processes affect current assets and operating results and are therefore critical in assessing the financial and operating status of the company 
these estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on the company s operations and financial position 
research and development costs incurred in the discovery of new knowledge and the resulting translation of this new knowledge into plans and designs for new products  prior to the attainment of the related products technological feasibility  are recorded as expenses in the period incurred 
product design costs incurred in the development of products after technological feasibility is attained are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the related products  not to exceed years 
the company considers technological feasibility to be established when the company has completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish design specifications including function  features and technical performance requirements 
capitalization of product design costs ceases and amortization of such costs begins when the product is available for general release to customers 
the company periodically assesses the value of capitalized product design costs and records a reserve for obsolescence or impairment when  in the circumstances including the discontinuance or probable discontinuance of the related products from the market  it deems the asset to be obsolete or impaired 
the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory was   and  at december   and respectively 
the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory is used to determine the company s inventories at the lower of average cost or net realizable value 
since the amount of inventorial cost that the company will truly recoup through sales cannot be known with exact certainty  the company relies on past sales experience and future sales forecasts 
inventory is considered as obsolete and an allowance in an amount equal to of the average cost of such inventory is recorded if the company has withdrawn it from the market or if the company has had no sales of the product for the past months nor sales forecasted for the next months 
the company classifies as slow moving inventory those with quantities on hand greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months  and reserve such amount as is adequate to reduce the carrying value to its estimated net realizable value 
the company performs an obsolete and slow moving inventory review twice a year and writes off identified obsolete and slow moving inventory accordingly 
the company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers and adjusts their credit ratings accordingly 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for un collectable amounts based on its historical experience and any other issues it has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within its expectations  the company cannot guarantee this will continue in the future 
the allowances recorded for  and were approximately    and  respectively 
the amount written off  net of recoveries in was  which related primarily to very old receivables acquired as part of the smx acquisition 
the company reserved for these doubtful receivables in  therefore there was no income statement effect of this write off in transactions with related and other parties the company leases its headquarters from xenon research  inc xenon  all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of which is owned by simon raab  the company s president and chief executive officer  and diana raab  his spouse 
the term of the lease expires on february   and the company has two five year renewal options 
base rent under the lease was  for base rent during renewal periods will reflect changes in the us bureau of labor statistics consumer price index for all urban consumers 
foreign exchange exposure the company conducts a significant portion of its business outside the united states 
at present  a slight majority of the company s revenues are invoiced  and a significant portion of its operating expenses paid  in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  and could specifically result in foreign exchange gains and losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of the company s operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to the extent that the percentage of the company s non us dollar revenues derived from international sales increases in the future  the company s exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will increase further 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations in recent years and does not expect inflation to have a material impact on its operations in impact of recently issued accounting standards in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements eitf 
eitf addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
the consensus mandates how to identify whether goods or services or both that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately because they are separate units of accounting the guidance can affect the timing of revenue recognition for such arrangements  even though it does not change rules governing the timing or pattern of revenue recognition of individual items accounted for separately 
the final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal years beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
the company is assessing  but at this point does not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in january  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under current practice  two enterprises generally have been included in consolidated financial statements because one enterprise controls the other through voting interests 
this interpretation defines the concept of variable interests and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risks among the parties involved 
this interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applied in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when this interpretation becomes effective  the enterprise shall disclose information about those entities in all financial statements issued after january  the interpretation may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
we have completed our assessment of this interpretation and determined that we are not party to any variable interest entities as of december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  an amendment of sfas sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement was effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this standard was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities that are subject to the provisions of this statement for the first fiscal period beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
cautionary statements we discuss expectations regarding our future performance and make other forward looking statements in our annual and quarterly reports  press releases  and other written and oral statements 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available competitive  financial  and economic data and our operating plans 
they are inherently uncertain  and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations 
the following discussion of risks and uncertainties which is not exclusive  highlights some important factors to consider when evaluating our trends and future results 
our customers buying process for our products is highly decentralized  and therefore  it typically requires significant time and expense for us to further penetrate the potential market of a specific customer  which may delay our ability to generate additional revenue 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to further penetrate our customer base 
most of our customers have a decentralized buying process for measurement devices 
thus  we must spend significant time and resources to increase revenues from a specific customer 
for example  we may provide products to only one of our customers manufacturing facilities or for a specific product line within a manufacturing facility 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase the amount of sales to our existing customers 
others may develop products that make our products obsolete or less competitive 
the computer aided manufacturing measurement cam market is emerging and could be characterized by rapid technological change 
others may develop new or improved products  processes or technologies may make our products obsolete or less competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or maintain our technological advantage 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to maintain our technological advantage by developing new products and enhancing our existing products 
developing new products and enhancing our existing products can be complex and time consuming 
significant delays in new product releases  or difficulties in developing new products  could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
because our customers are concentrated in a few industries  a reduction in sales to any one of these industries could cause a significant decline in our revenues 
approximately of our sales are to manufacturers in the automotive  aerospace  and heavy equipment industries 
we are dependent upon the continued growth  viability  and financial stability of our customers in these industries  which are highly cyclical and dependent upon the general health of the economy and consumer spending 
the cyclical nature of these industries may exert significant influence on our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  the volume of orders from our customers and the prices of our products may be adversely impacted by decreases in capital spending by a significant portion of our customers during recessionary periods 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with providing products and services to our customers 
if one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the products provided by us  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our inability to protect our patents and proprietary rights in the united states and foreign countries could adversely affect our revenues 
our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary right protection for our processes and products in the united states and other countries 
we also rely upon trade secrets  technical know how  and continuing inventions to maintain our competitive position 
we seek to protect our technology and trade secrets  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees and contractors 
our employees may breach these agreements or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by inventors 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain protection of our patents  trade secrets  and other proprietary rights  we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary rights 
our patent protection involves complex legal and technical questions 
our patents may be challenged  narrowed  invalidated  or circumvented 
we may be able to protect our proprietary rights from infringement by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary processes and products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies 
litigation or other proceedings to defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could require us to spend significant time and money and could otherwise adversely affect our business 
claims from others that we infringe their intellectual property rights may adversely affect our operations 
from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights 
the number of these claims may grow 
responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms  require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products  or require us to pay damages 
any litigation or interference proceedings  regardless of their outcome  may be costly and may require significant time and attention of our management and technical personnel 
our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our annual and quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and likely will vary significantly in the future as a result of o the size and timing of customer orders  o the amount of time that it takes to fulfill orders and ship our products  o the length of our sales cycle to new customers and the time and expense incurred in further penetrating our existing customer base  o increases in operating expenses required for product development and new product marketing  o costs associated with new product introductions  such as assembly line start up costs and low introductory period production volumes  o the timing and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements  o customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements  o our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs  o start up costs associated with opening new sales offices outside of the united states  o fluctuations in revenue without proportionate adjustments in fixed costs  o the efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and fixed assets  and o adverse changes in the manufacturing industry and general economic conditions 
any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly operating results in the future 
the cam market is an emerging market  and our growth depends on the ability of our products to attain broad market acceptance 
the cam market is in an early stage of adoption 
the market for traditional fixed base coordinate measurement machines cmms  check fixtures  and other handheld measurement tools is mature 
part of our strategy is to continue to displace these traditional measurement devices 
displacing traditional measurement devices and achieving broad market acceptance of our products requires significant effort to convince manufacturers to reevaluate their historical measurement procedures and methodologies 
we market three closely interdependent products faroarms  faro laser tracker  and faro gage and related software for use in measurement and inspection applications 
substantially all our revenues currently are derived from sales of these products and software  and we plan to continue our business strategy of focusing on the portable software driven  d measurement and inspection market 
consequently  our financial performance will depend in large part on portable  computer based measurement and inspection products achieving broad market acceptance 
if our products cannot attain broad market acceptance  we will not grow as anticipated and may be required to make increased expenditures on research and development for new applications or new products 
we compete with manufacturers of portable measurement systems and traditional measurement devices  many of which have more resources than us and may develop products or technologies that will directly compete with us 
our portable measurement systems compete in the broad market for measurement devices for manufacturing and industrial applications  which  in addition to portable articulated arms and laser tracker products  consists of fixed base cmms  check fixtures  and handheld measurement tools 
the broad market for measurement devices is highly competitive 
manufacturers of handheld measurement tools and fixed base cmms include a significant number of well established companies that are substantially larger and possess substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we possess 
in the laser tracker product line  we compete primarily with leica geosystems  who is significantly larger than us and  we believe  currently the leader in this product line 
we will be required to make continued investments in technology and product development to maintain our technological advantage over our competition 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make additional investments in technology and product development or that our product development efforts will allow us to successfully compete as the industry evolves 
our competitors may develop products or technologies that directly compete with us 
for example  fixed base cmms are introducing computer aided design cad based inspection software in response to the trend toward cad based factory floor metrology 
in addition  some fixed base cmm manufacturers are miniaturizing and increasing the mobility of their conventional cmms 
these companies may continue to alter their products and devote resources to the development and marketing of additional products that compete with ours 
we derive a substantial part of our revenues from our international operations  which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations 
since  we have derived over of our sales from international operations 
we recently opened a manufacturing facility in schaufhausen  switzerland and have regional sales offices in germany  france  spain  italy  japan  and the united kingdom 
we are in the process of opening our first direct sales offices in china 
should trade relations between the united states and china deteriorate  our ability to transfer products between china and other regions of the world  including the united states  asia  and europe could be significantly impaired and our results of operations would suffer 
in our experience  entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start up expenses for market development  hiring  and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated 
as a result  initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable 
our international operations may be subject to a number of risks  including o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  o political and economic instability  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws  o longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable  o export duties  import controls  and trade barriers  o governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the united states  o burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could affect local payroll utility and other expenses  and o inability to use net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations to reduce our us income taxes 
several of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies  which may be subject to greater currency volatility  negative growth  high inflation  limited availability of foreign exchange  and other risks 
these factors may harm our results of operations and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective 
in addition  during and  several asian countries  including japan  experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation 
if such situations reoccur or occur in other regions where we operate  it may negatively impact out sales and our ability to collect payments from customers in these regions 
we rely to a large extent on the experience and management ability of our senior executive officers 
our success will depend  in part  on the services of our founders  simon raab  our chief executive officer  and gregory fraser  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
the loss or interruption of the continued full time services of these executives could have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not have employment agreements with these executives 
we may not be able to identify  consummate  or achieve expected benefits from acquisitions 
we have completed two significant acquisitions since our initial public offering in we intend to pursue access to additional technologies  complementary product lines  and sales channels through selective acquisitions and strategic investments 
we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions  obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future 
in the past  we have used our stock as consideration for acquisitions 
our common stock may not remain at a price at which it can be used as consideration for acquisitions without diluting our existing shareholders  and potential acquisition candidates may not view our stock attractively 
realization of the benefits of acquisitions often requires integration of some or all of the acquired companies sales and marketing  distribution  manufacturing  engineering  finance  and administrative organizations 
the integration of acquisitions demands substantial attention from senior management and the management of the acquired companies 
any acquisition may be subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including o the inability to assimilate effectively the operations  products  technologies  and personnel of the acquired companies some of which may be located in diverse geographic regions  o the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  o the need or obligation to divest portions of the acquired companies  and o the potential impairment of relationships with customers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate successfully any acquisitions or that any acquired companies will operate profitably  or that we will realize the expected benefits from any acquisition 
we may face difficulties managing growth 
our growth has placed significant demands on our management and operations and financial resources 
if our business continues to grow rapidly in the future  we expect it to result in o increased responsibility for existing and new management personnel  and o incremental strain on our operations  and financial and management systems 
our success under such conditions will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to operate effectively both independently and as a group 
if we are not able to manage future growth  our business  financial condition  and operating results may be harmed 
our dependence on suppliers for materials could impair our ability to manufacture our products 
outside vendors provide key components used by us in the manufacture of our products 
although we believe that alternative sources for these components are available  any supply interruption in a limited source component would harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified 
in addition  an uncorrected defect or supplier s variation in a component  either known or unknown to us  or incompatible with our manufacturing processes  could harm our ability to manufacture our products 
we may not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable period  or on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we fail to obtain a supplier for the manufacture of components of our potential products  we may experience delays or interruptions in our operations  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may experience volatility in our stock price 
the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including o developments in the industries in which we operate  o actual or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual operating results  o speculation in the press or investment community  and o announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors 
our common stock s market price may also be affected by our inability to meet analyst and investor expectations and failure to achieve projected financial results  including those set forth in this prospectus 
any failure to meet such expectations or projected financial results  even if minor  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
volatility in our stock price may result in your inability to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them 
in addition  stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and the market prices of equity securities of many companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock s market price 
in the past  securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against such companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies securities 
if any such litigation is instigated against us  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
our executive officers and directors control a significant percentage of our common stock and these shareholders may take actions that are adverse to your interests 
our executive officers and directors and entities affiliated with them  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our common stock  of which is beneficially owned by our two co founders  simon raab and gregory fraser 
as a result  these shareholders  acting together  can significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election and removal of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers  consolidations  and sales of assets 
they also could dictate the management of our business and affairs 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control or impeding a merger or consolidation  takeover  or other business combination  which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or prevent you from receiving a premium in such a transaction 
anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of florida law could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor 
our articles of incorporation  our bylaws  and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to you 
these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our shares 
because of these provisions  you might not be able to receive a premium on your investment 
these provisions include o a limitation on shareholders ability to call a special meeting of our shareholders  o advance notice requirements to nominate directors for election to our board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings  and o the authority of the board of directors to issue  without shareholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine 
the provisions described above could delay or make more difficult transactions involving a change in control of us  or our management

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange exposure the company conducts a significant portion of its business outside the united states 
at present  a slight majority of the company s revenues are invoiced  and a significant portion of its operating expenses paid  in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  and could specifically result in foreign exchange gains and losses
