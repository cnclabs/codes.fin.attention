item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the largest casino hotel operators in the united states 
we have a significant presence in nevada  new jersey and mississippi  the three largest state gaming markets in the united states 
our properties operate under the caesars  bally s  flamingo  grand casinos  hilton and paris brand names 
in order to better leverage what we believe is the best known brand name in gaming and to better position our company throughout our existing markets and future development opportunities  we changed our name from park place entertainment corporation to caesars entertainment  inc in january operational discussion our primary sources of revenue consist of casino operations  room rentals  and food and beverage sales 
we generate approximately of our net revenues from casino operations 
casino revenue is derived primarily from patrons wagering on slot machines  table games and other gaming activities 
table games generally include blackjack or twenty one  craps  baccarat and roulette 
other gaming activities include keno  poker and race and sports 
casino revenue is defined as the win from gaming activities  computed as the difference between gaming wins and losses  not the total amounts wagered 
table game volume  table game drop terms which are used interchangeably  and slot handle are casino industry specific terms that are used to identify the amount wagered by patrons for a casino table game or slot machine  respectively 
table game hold and slot hold represent the percentage of the total amount wagered by patrons that the casino has won 
hold is derived by dividing the amount won by the casino by the amount wagered by patrons 
casino revenue is recognized at the end of each gaming day 
room revenues are derived from rooms and suites rented to guests 
average daily rate is an industry specific term used to define the average amount of revenue per rented room per day 
occupancy percentage defines the total percentage of rooms occupied  and is computed by dividing the number of rooms occupied by the total number of rooms available 
room revenue is recognized at the time the room is provided to the guest 
we are focusing on  among other things  increasing the number of hotel room bookings via the internet 
food and beverage revenues are derived from food and beverage sales in the food outlets of our casino hotels  including restaurants  room service and banquets 
food and beverage revenue is recognized at the time the food and or beverage is provided to the guest 
due to the addition of new food outlets  including future outlets currently being constructed  we expect food and beverage revenue to increase over time 
other revenue is derived primarily from entertainment  retail and management fee services 
like our room revenues and food and beverage revenues  these revenues are recognized at the time the service is provided 
casino revenues vary from time to time due to general economic conditions  popularity of entertainment offerings  table game hold  slot hold  and occupancy rates in the hotels 
casino revenues also vary depending upon the amount of gaming activity as well as variations in the odds for different games of chance 
we are also using technology  such as cashless wagering on slot machines  to increase revenues and or decrease expenses 
casino revenues  room revenues  food and beverage revenues  and other revenues also vary due to general economic conditions and competition 
we believe that our operating results for the year ended december  reflect the impact of reduced consumer spending and  to a lesser extent  the military operations in iraq which began in the first quarter of and the adverse impact on travel of periodic terrorist warnings from the united states government 
the eastern region was adversely impacted by the july opening of the first new casino resort in atlantic city since in northern nevada and laughlin  the continued negative impact of the expansion of native american gaming in california and arizona resulted in impairment charges at our caesars tahoe and flamingo laughlin properties 
we are seeing indicators of economic improvement  and we expect a gradual recovery in consumer confidence and discretionary spending during substantial economic issues still remain related to the economy  consumer confidence  and continued competition from the expansion of native american gaming in california and the july opening of a new resort in atlantic city 
we continue to closely examine our cost structure through our work smart cost reduction program 
since the program was started in  we have reduced costs in targeted categories by about million 
those operational savings were offset by increased expenses in other areas such as gaming taxes  salaries  wages and benefits  and insurance costs 
financial strategy in the past  collectively  our properties have generated substantial positive cash flow  and we expect that they will continue to generate positive cash flow for the foreseeable future 
our first priority for the use of that cash flow is to reinvest in our properties through the maintenance and enhancement of existing facilities  to add new amenities to those facilities  and to invest in new developments in new markets 
our second priority is to reduce our debt leverage by using the cash flow in excess of what is reinvested in our properties and new developments to pay down debt 
our third priority for the use of cash flow is return of capital to shareholders  through share repurchases or dividends 
only to the extent that we have sufficient excess cash flow after reinvestment in our properties and reduction of debt will we be able to make meaningful returns of capital to shareholders

casino consolidated casino revenues decreased one percent or million to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december  this decrease consisted of a million decline in the western region and a million decline in the eastern region 
caesars palace was the only property in the western region to record an increase in casino revenue compared to the prior year 
the increased table game and slot volumes at caesars palace were principally driven by additional guest traffic due to the  seat colosseum and new food and beverage venues 
the revenue increase at caesars palace was achieved despite a one percentage point decline in the table game hold percentage in as compared to the prior year 
paris bally s recorded a decline in casino revenues of million due to lower table game and slot volumes as well as a decline in the table game hold percentage of percentage points 
this decline in volumes is a result of the temporary closing in the first quarter of of the monorail that ran between bally s las vegas and mgm grand on the south end of the strip and our decision to consolidate high end table game play at caesars palace 
the monorail brought approximately  guests a day through bally s las vegas 
a new and expanded monorail is expected to begin operations in march in the eastern region  our casino revenue decline was attributable to increased competition added to that market during several competitors have added new hotel rooms and casino space  and the borgata  a new  room casino resort  opened in july the borgata is the first new resort to open in the atlantic city market since as a result of the capacity increases by others in the market  both table game and slot volumes were down in as compared to the table hold percentage was slightly higher in our consolidated casino operating margin decreased to percent for the year ended december  compared to percent for the year ended december  the decrease in casino margin was attributable to the decline in revenues noted above  an increase in gaming taxes at our indiana property which went into effect july  increase in certain other taxes in new jersey and nevada which went into effect in the second half of the year  and increased employee benefits costs across all regions 
rooms average daily rate occupancy percentage year ended december  year ended december  western region eastern region mid south region consolidated room revenues increased five percent or million to million for the year ended december  compared to million recorded for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to the western region  especially our las vegas properties  where room revenues increased due to higher average daily rates 
the most significant improvements in room revenues were seen at paris bally s and flamingo las vegas 
our consolidated room operating margin for the year ended december  was percent compared to percent for the year ended december  the decline is a result of increased employee benefits costs across all regions 
food and beverage consolidated food and beverage revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to increases at our western region properties 
the most significant increases were at our las vegas properties where we opened a new restaurant and nightclub and expanded our buffet at paris bally s  added two new food outlets at caesars palace  and added two new restaurants at flamingo las vegas 
paris bally s also experienced improvements in banquet revenue due to increased convention business compared to the prior year 
our consolidated food and beverage operating margin decreased to percent for the year ended december  compared to percent in the prior year 
this decrease is due to an increase in salaries wages and employee benefits especially at our las vegas properties due to new union contracts that became effective during we also experienced a slight increase in our costs of sales 
other consolidated other revenues include retail sales  entertainment sales  telephone  management fee income and other miscellaneous income at our casino hotels 
consolidated other revenues increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase came primarily from caesars palace which was attributable to entertainment offerings at the new colosseum and business interruption income from the forum shops developer related to the expansion that is currently underway 
consolidated other expenses include costs associated with selling  general  administrative  property operations  retail  entertainment  telephone and other miscellaneous costs at our casino hotels 
consolidated other expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to increased salaries wages and employee benefits costs as well as increases in other expenses such as insurance and real estate taxes 
depreciation and amortization consolidated depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for comparable period of depreciation expense for the current year decreased due to certain short lived assets becoming fully depreciated before being replaced 
this was especially true at our caesars indiana property which celebrated its year anniversary in the asset write down at the flamingo laughlin also contributed approximately million to this decrease 
impairment losses and other due to the continued proliferation of native american gaming in arizona and southern california  the laughlin  nevada market has suffered substantially increased competition 
because of the increased competition  flamingo laughlin has experienced a decline in its operating results 
in accordance with sfas no 
 due to this decline in operations and lower future expectations  we determined the carrying value of flamingo laughlin s long lived assets exceeded their fair market value 
we engaged an independent company to assist in determining the fair value of the flamingo laughlin s long lived assets 
the fair value was determined by a combination of a discounted cash flow model  a guideline company method  and similar transaction method 
based on this analysis  the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeded the fair value by million 
accordingly  an impairment loss was recognized during the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we completed the annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
the company engaged an independent company to assist in the valuation of properties with a significant amount of assigned goodwill 
the fair value of the operating entities was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow model  a guideline company method using valuation multiples and similar transaction method 
based on this analysis  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million at caesars tahoe in the fourth quarter of the impairment resulted from a decline in operations at caesars tahoe  as well as lower future expectations attributable to the increased competition from native american gaming in northern california

those agreements must be executed before construction can begin  and the management contract  which we estimate will be for a term of seven years  is subject to approval by the national indian gaming commission the nigc and other regulators 
preliminary plans call for a hotel and casino complex  with more than  square feet of gaming space 
the casino could open as early as big sandy band of western mono indians in january  we reached a preliminary agreement with the big sandy band of western mono indians to develop and manage a casino resort on tribal lands near fresno  california 
preliminary plans for the project call for development of a casino resort on more than acres miles northeast of fresno in the san joaquin valley in central california 
included in the acreage is a acre parcel of tribal land where the gaming portion of the facility will be located 
the casino resort would become the second to directly serve the fresno metropolitan area which has a population of approximately million 
the casino property would initially include to hotel rooms  more than  square feet of gaming space  at least  slot machines  approximately gaming tables  restaurants  retail shops  and meeting and entertainment facilities 
the big sandy tribe currently operates the mono wind casino in auberry  california  about miles northeast from the site of the proposed casino project 
a management agreement for the casino resort  which we estimate will be for a term not greater than seven years  requires the approval of the nigc 
in addition  the big sandy tribe would have to amend its existing compact with the state of california  or negotiate a new compact for the new casino project 
the project also is dependent on other regulatory approvals and contingencies 
saint regis mohawk tribe we entered into an agreement in april with the saint regis mohawk tribe the tribe in hogansburg  new york in which we paid million for the exclusive rights to develop a class ii or class iii casino project with the tribe in the state of new york 
in november  the parties entered into a definitive management agreement for the company to manage a casino to be located at kutsher s country club in thompson  new york  which agreement was subject to the approval of the nigc 
the nigc gave comments to the tribe and the company regarding the management agreement s conformity with federal laws  regulations and policies pertaining to such agreements 
as a result of these comments and in order to further the approval process of the nigc  the company and the tribe entered into on november   a first amended and restated management agreement and a first amended and restated development agreement the amended agreements 
the amended agreements provide  among other things  that the company will manage the casino for seven years for a management fee equal to percent of net total revenue  as defined  and that the exclusive right for casino development in the state of new york has been modified to provide for mutual non compete protections within a mile zone from the sullivan county location 
the term of the amended agreements is seven years from the commencement of casino operations 
additionally  we will receive a development fee of million for its services in developing and constructing the casino facility and the tribe will assume the funding of the parking garage construction  which is estimated to cost approximately million 
the amended agreements are subject to final approval by the nigc 
we have entered into a definitive agreement  as amended  to acquire approximately acres of the kutsher s resort hotel and country club in sullivan county  new york  for approximately million  with an option to purchase the remaining  acres for million 
upon approval of the bureau of indian affairs the bia  the acre parcel will be transferred to be held in trust for the saint regis mohawk tribe 
all of the agreements and plans relating to the development and management of this project are contingent upon various regulatory and governmental approvals  including execution of a compact between the saint regis mohawk tribe and the state of new york  and receipt of approvals from the bia  nigc and local planning and zoning boards 
there is no guarantee that the requisite regulatory approvals will be received 
other from time to time we become aware of potential acquisition or development opportunities and we may at any time be negotiating to engage in transactions or developments both domestically and internationally 
additionally  we regularly evaluate all of our assets within our portfolio and have and will continue to consider disposition of assets that  in our opinion  do not represent the best use of our capital 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with cash on hand and availability under our various credit facilities  will be adequate to fund our capital spending that we are reasonably likely to make over the foreseeable future 
to the extent that our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate or that our various credit instruments are not extended or renewed in adequate amounts  we may be required to reduce or suspend our capital spending activities 
borrowings at december   we had approximately billion in long term indebtedness outstanding 
of this amount  approximately billion is borrowed under nine separate bond issues maturing at various dates from july to may the remaining billion is drawn under our credit facilities 
we have two principal credit facilities  collectively known as the credit facilities 
the first is a day revolving facility expiring in august  with total availability of approximately million 
at december   amounts borrowed under the day revolving facility were million 
the second facility is a two year extension of our five year revolving facility which was terminated on december  the two year extension will expire in december maximum availability under this facility is approximately billion  of which approximately million is a term loan and the balance is a revolver 
if prepaid  the availability of the term loan component is permanently reduced 
amounts paid down under the revolver may be reborrowed 
at december   amounts borrowed under the term loan and the revolver were million and million  respectively 
the credit facilities contain financial covenants including a maximum leverage ratio total debt divided by ebitda  as defined in the credit facilities of to and a minimum interest coverage ratio ebitda  as defined in the credit facilities  divided by interest expense of to as of december  the maximum leverage ratio remains at to for the quarterly testing periods ending march  and june   and then adjusts to to for the quarterly testing periods ending september  through march   to for the quarterly testing period ending june   and to thereafter 
the interest coverage ratio remains to for all quarterly testing periods 
we are required to compute our actual leverage and interest coverage ratios on a rolling twelve month basis as of the end of each calendar quarter 
if we are not in compliance with the required covenant ratios  an event of default would occur  which if not cured  could cause the entire outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities to become immediately due and payable as well as trigger the cross default provisions of other debt issues 
as of december   we were in compliance with the applicable covenants 
borrowings under the credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate and may be obtained  at our option  as libor advances for varying periods  or as base rate advances  each adjusted for an applicable margin as further described in the credit facilities 
we have historically borrowed using libor advances and expect to continue doing so for the foreseeable future 
we pay a margin over libor which is a function of both our leverage ratio and our credit rating 
this margin is adjusted quarterly 
prior to september  our senior debt rating from moody s investment services was bal and from standard poor s was bbb 
in september  standard poor s announced its decision to lower our senior debt credit rating to bb 
as a result of this action  the company s effective all in borrowing cost of libor advances under the credit facilities increased to libor plus basis points from basis points 
as of december   our effective all in borrowing cost of libor advances under the credit facilities was libor plus basis points 
the maximum all in borrowing costs for libor loans is under credit facilities plus or minus pre determined discounts based on our leverage ratios 
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities was percent at december  and percent at december  currently our senior debt is rated ba by moody s investment services and bb by standard poor s 
if our debt rating was lowered by one level  the annual interest on our credit facilities would increase by approximately million per year based on outstanding borrowings of billion at december  we have established a commercial paper program 
to the extent that we incur debt under this program  we must maintain an equivalent amount of credit available under our credit facilities 
we have not borrowed under this program since in a program designed for short term borrowings at lower interest rates than under our credit facilities  we have entered into an uncommitted line of credit with a lender whereby we can borrow up to million for periods of ninety days or less 
at december  and  we had no borrowings outstanding under this agreement  which expires july borrowings bear interest at current market rates 
interest rates on amounts borrowed under these agreements during the year ranged from percent to percent  and during the rates ranged from percent to percent 
in april  we issued million of percent senior notes due through a private placement offering to institutional investors 
these notes were subsequently exchanged for notes registered under the securities act of  as amended 
the notes are redeemable at any time prior to their maturity at the make whole premiums described in the indenture governing such notes 
the notes are unsecured obligations  rank equal with our other senior indebtedness and are senior to all of our junior indebtedness 
in august  our issue of million percent senior notes matured and were retired using borrowings under the credit facilities 
our indebtedness contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains customary events of default  including without limitation  payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency and cross defaults to other material indebtedness 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
in january  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission registering up to billion in debt or equity securities 
the terms of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration will be determined by market conditions at the time of issuance 
in november  million of percent senior notes were issued and in september  million of percent senior subordinated notes were issued under this shelf registration statement 
availability under the shelf registration statement at december  was approximately million 
interest rate swaps pursuant to our risk management policy  management may engage in actions to manage our interest rate risk position 
during  we entered into four interest rate swaps representing million notional amount with members of our bank group to manage interest expense 
the interest rate swaps have converted a portion of our fixed rate debt to a floating rate fair value hedges 
under the agreements  we receive a fixed interest rate of percent and pay a variable interest rate based on a margin above libor on the million notional amount 
the interest rate swaps mature in the net effect of the interest rate swaps resulted in a reduction in interest expense of million for the year ended december  these interest rate swaps meet the shortcut criteria under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which permits the assumption of no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship between the swap and the underlying hedged asset or liability 
as such  there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments 
instead  the fair value of the instrument is recorded as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded other long term assets of million as of december   representing the fair value of the interest rate swaps and a corresponding increase in long term debt  as these interest rate swaps are considered highly effective under the criteria established by sfas no 
share repurchases our board of directors has approved the repurchase of up to million shares under a common stock repurchase program 
we repurchased no shares during the year ended december  cumulatively  through december   we had repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock at an average price of resulting in million shares remaining available under the stock repurchase program 
the amount and timing of any additional purchases will depend on market conditions and our financial position 
we currently expect that excess free cash flow will be used primarily to reinvest in our properties and reduce debt outstanding 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 
we have investments in joint ventures and other unconsolidated affiliates which are caesars gauteng  conrad punta del este  casino windsor and the margaritaville caf collectively  joint ventures 
except for conrad punta del este  we have not guaranteed financing related to any of the investments 
we have guaranteed the repayment of a million bank loan to conrad punta del este  which we satisfied by providing a million letter of credit 
there are no other provisions in our agreements with the joint ventures that are unusual or subject us to risks different than if we retain full ownership of such entities 
we have not entered into arrangements which cause us to have a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity 
currently  we have no guarantees  such as performance guarantees  keep well agreements or indemnity agreements other than letters of credit  that are material to the company and or performance under the guarantee is likely to occur 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million 
we are not engaged in derivatives except for traditional interest rate swaps used to effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations which we record as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
we also enter into other purchase commitments and other executory contracts that are not recognized as liabilities until services are performed or goods are received 
additionally  we enter into contracts for goods and services such as food  inventory and entertainment 
such liabilities are recorded as liabilities when so incurred and we expect that such contracts will generate revenue in excess of such liabilities 
however  such liabilities are not material to the company as a whole 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  amounts in millions payments due by period less than year years years more than years total long term debt    operating leases other purchase obligations employment contracts capital expenditure commitments other other long term obligations as noted in the selected new projects section  we are currently constructing a new hotel tower at caesars palace and a new parking garage at caesars atlantic city both of which will be completed in the combined budget for these projects was million of which million has been incurred as of december  the table above reflects commitments related to these projects of million 
includes million for open purchase orders in saint regis mohawk tribe as part of our planned development with the saint regis mohawk tribe we have entered into a definitive agreement  as amended  to acquire approximately acres of the kutsher s resort hotel and country club in sullivan county  new york  for approximately million  with an option to purchase the remaining  acres for million 
upon approval of the bureau of indian affairs  we will be required to exercise this option and the acre parcel will be transferred to be held in trust for the saint regis mohawk tribe 
there are no amounts related to this project in the above table due to the uncertainty in the timing of payments 
hilton hotels retirement plan pursuant to the employee benefits and other employment matters allocation agreement by and between hilton hotels corporation and the company dated as of december   the company shall retain or assume  as applicable  all liabilities and excess assets  if any  related to the hilton hotels retirement plan based on the ratio of accrued benefits of hilton employees and the company s employees 
based on this ratio the company s share of any benefit or obligations would be approximately percent of the total 
the hilton hotels retirement plan is a defined benefit plan that provides benefits based on years of service and compensation  as defined 
since december   employees have not accrued additional benefits under this plan 
the plan is administered by hilton hotels corporation 
hilton hotels corporation has informed the company that as of december   the plan benefit obligations exceed the fair value of the plan assets by million  however  no contributions to the plan were required during and no contributions will be required for other in addition to the items noted above  other significant uses of our cash include interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations  income taxes  and uncommitted capital expenditures 
cash paid for interest was million and million for and  respectively 
cash paid for taxes was million and million for and  respectively 
we expect our cash interest and tax payments to be similar to prior years 
our uncommitted capital expenditures plan was previously discussed under liquidity 
baluma holdings  sa over the past several years  we have provided capital in the form of loans to baluma holdings  sa holdings  the ultimate parent of baluma  sa baluma  the entity that owns the conrad punta del este the resort  in punta del este  uruguay 
two promissory notes the baluma loans  aggregating million in principal  matured on july  the principal  together with certain accrued and unpaid interest  was not repaid 
the baluma loans are secured by a first priority lien on all the assets comprising the resort and on the stock of baluma 
baluma is heavily indebted  and a restructuring of baluma s debt is needed 
in october  the board of directors of baluma agreed to restructure the indebtedness owed to us by exchanging the baluma loans together with accrued and unpaid interest for percent convertible preferred stock of baluma 
such restructuring is conditioned upon  among other things  holders of baluma s million of publicly traded subordinated notes agreeing to extend the maturity of such notes and certain other amendments 
in addition  after the restructuring  we will have five of the seven seats on baluma s board of directors 
we intend to continue to operate the resort pursuant to the management agreement 
if the restructuring occurs as proposed  we will have the ability to exercise significant influence over the management of baluma  and accordingly would be required to consolidate baluma s results of operations 
the proposed restructuring is expected to be completed in the net amount of the company s investments in baluma at december  and was million and million  respectively 
regulation and taxes the gaming industry is highly regulated and we must adhere to various regulations and maintain our licenses to continue our operations 
the ownership  management  and operation of gaming facilities are subject to extensive federal  state  provincial  tribal and or local laws  rules  and regulations  which are administered by the relevant regulatory agency or agencies in each jurisdiction 
these laws  rules  and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  but generally concern the responsibility  financial stability  and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations 
the regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the gaming industry provides a significant source of tax revenue for the states  counties  and municipalities in which we operate 
occasionally  proposals are made by federal and state legislators to amend tax laws affecting the gaming industry 
changes in such laws  if any  would have a material effect on our results of operations 
the general economic downturn has increased the need for state and local governments to fund budget deficits in many of the states where we have operations 
in partial response  several state legislatures  including nevada and new jersey  increased existing taxes and or enacted new taxes on businesses operating within the state  and in some cases specifically targeted additional tax measures at hotel casinos during we cannot predict if or when new tax proposals will be enacted 
critical accounting policies a summary of our critical accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions 
significant among those estimates are the useful lives and potential impairment of long term assets  the adequacy of our allowance for uncollectible receivables  and the amount of litigation and self insurance reserves 
these estimated amounts are based on our best judgments using both historical information and known trends in our company and in our industry 
because of the uncertainty inherent in any estimate  it is possible that the actual results could differ from the initial estimates  and the differences could be material 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered to be the most significant 
long lived assets we have a significant amount of capital invested in our property and equipment which is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we use judgment in determining if or when assets have been impaired and the estimated useful lives of assets 
the accuracy of these estimates affects whether or not an impairment exists  and the depreciation expense recognized in our results of operations 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which we believe represents the useful life of each category of asset 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying values of our long lived assets are reviewed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assets are grouped at the property level when estimating future cash flows for determining whether an asset has been impaired 
management assesses the possibility of an asset impairment by using the estimates of future cash flows which are affected by current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
our analysis of cash flows represents our best estimates at the time of the review 
however  changes in these assumptions  due to actual market conditions that cause less favorable results than our estimates  may result in impairments in the future 
goodwill and other intangible assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that requires an annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
as of december  we have goodwill of million recorded on our balance sheet 
we completed our implementation analysis and recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter of we also completed our annual review of impairment during the fourth quarter of  and determined that goodwill at caesars tahoe had been further impaired 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the annual evaluation of goodwill requires the estimates of future operating results for each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
if these estimates change in the future due to operating results  trends  the effect of demand  competition or other economic factors  we may be required to record additional impairments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we allow for an estimated amount of receivables that may not be collected 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts using a specific formula applied to aged receivables as well as a specific review of large account balances 
in determining specific reserves  historical experience is considered  as are customer relationships  aging of the balance  and the customer s financial condition 
while we believe that our current reserves are adequate and reasonable  changes in the economy or future terrorist activities could impact the ability of our customers to pay and additional reserves could be required 
litigation reserves the company assesses its exposures to loss contingencies including legal matters and provides for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimate  operating results would be impacted 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation  and employee medical insurance coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
in estimating these costs  we consider our historical claims experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
while we believe our current reserves are adequate and reasonable  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
loyalty club program we offer to our guests the opportunity to earn points redeemable for cash and complimentary rooms and food and beverage based on their level of gaming and non gaming activities while at our properties 
an accrual is recorded as points are earned based upon expected redemption rates and  in the case of complimentaries  the estimated cost of the complimentary to be provided 
if our guests increase their redemption levels above what is currently expected based on historical trends  increases in our reserve would be required 
income taxes we provide for income taxes on united states federal  state and foreign source income derived from activities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
as a matter of course  we are subject to examination by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
the internal revenue service is currently examining our tax returns for the years ended december   and while we believe our tax return positions comply with applicable tax law  the internal revenue service or other taxing authorities may assert that one or more of our tax return positions is inconsistent with the tax laws of their jurisdiction 
if  as a result of any examination of our tax returns  a tax return position is ultimately not respected by an examining authority  we may be required to adjust our income tax liabilities and related tax provisions 
as of december  we had deferred tax assets that totaled million and deferred tax liabilities that totaled billion 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
during  we adopted sfas no 
which did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities revised december  clarifying fin and exempting certain entities from the provisions of fin r 
generally  application of fin r is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december   and  for other types of variable interest entities for periods ending after march  fin r addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that either do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or the company will hold a significant variable interest in  or have significant involvement with  an existing variable interest entity 
the adoption of fin r for provisions effective during did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes associated with our long term debt 
we attempt to limit the impact of changes in interest rates to our debt portfolio by having an appropriate mix of variable and fixed rate debt 
beginning in  we are utilizing  on a selective basis  interest rate swaps to manage our relative levels of fixed and floating rate debt 
we evaluate our exposure to interest rate risk by monitoring interest rates in the market place and do not use interest rate swaps for trading purposes 
as of december   we had four interest rate swap agreements which swap the fixed interest payments on our million senior notes due to a variable interest rate based on a margin above six month libor 
these swaps are designated as fair value hedges 
including the debt subject to the interest rate swaps  at december   billion of our total debt outstanding is subject to variable rate interest 
a hypothetical basis point percent change in the interest rate index on which our floating rate debt is based would result in an annual expense change of approximately million based on our debt balance at december  the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair market value of our long term debt and interest rate swaps amounts in millions thereafter total fair market long term debt fixed rate debt   average interest rate floating rate debt  average interest rate interest rate swaps fixed to variable average pay rate average received rate
