overview dialysis corporation of america provides dialysis services  primarily kidney dialysis treatments through outpatient dialysis centers  including a owned ohio affiliate and one unaffiliated dialysis center which it manages  to patients with chronic kidney failure  also know as end stage renal disease or esrd 
we provide dialysis treatments to dialysis patients of seven hospitals and medical centers through acute inpatient dialysis services agreements with those entities 
we provide homecare services  including home peritoneal dialysis through method ii services  the latter relating to providing patients with supplies and equipment 
the following table shows the number of in center  home peritoneal and acute inpatient treatments performed by us through the dialysis centers we operate  including the two centers we manage  one in which we have a ownership interest  and those hospitals and medical centers with which we have inpatient acute service agreements for the periods presented year ended december  in center    home peritoneal    acute    treatments by the two managed centers included in center treatments of   and  respectively  for  and  no home peritoneal treatments  and acute treatments of  and  respectively  for  and we also provide ancillary services associated with dialysis treatments  including the administration of epo for the treatment of anemia in our dialysis patients 
epo is currently available from only one manufacturer  and no alternative drug has been available to us for the treatment of anemia in our dialysis patients 
if our available supply of epo were reduced either by the manufacturer or due to excessive demand  our revenues and net income would be adversely affected 
the manufacturer of epo increased its price in early  and could implement further price increases which would adversely affect our net income 
this manufacturer has developed another anemia drug that could possibly substantially reduce our revenues and profit from the treatment of anemia in our patients 
esrd patients must either obtain a kidney transplant or obtain regular dialysis treatments for the rest of their lives 
due to a lack of suitable donors and the possibility of transplanted organ rejection  the most prevalent form of treatment for esrd patients is hemodialysis through a kidney dialysis machine 
hemodialysis patients usually receive three treatments each week with each treatment lasting between three and five hours on an outpatient basis 
although not as common as hemodialysis in an outpatient facility  home peritoneal dialysis is an available treatment option  representing the third most common type of esrd treatment after outpatient hemodialysis and kidney transplantation 
approximately of our medical service revenues are derived from medicare and medicaid reimbursement with rates established by cms  and which rates are subject to legislative changes 
over the last two years  medicare reimbursement rates have not increased 
dialysis is typically reimbursed at higher rates from private payors  such as a patient s insurance carrier  as well as higher payments received under negotiated contracts with hospitals for acute inpatient dialysis services 
the following table shows the breakdown of our revenues by type of payor for the periods presented year ended december  medicare medicaid and comparable programs hospital inpatient dialysis services commercial insurers and other private payors our medical service revenues are derived primarily from four sources outpatient hemodialysis services  home peritoneal dialysis services  inpatient hemodialysis services and ancillary services 
the following table shows the breakdown of our medical service revenues in thousands derived from our primary revenue sources and the percentage of total medical service revenue represented by each source for the periods presented year ended december  outpatient hemodialysis services    home peritoneal dialysis services  inpatient hemodialysis services    ancillary services    the healthcare industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal and state authorities 
there are a variety of fraud and abuse measures to combat waste  including anti kickback regulations and extensive prohibitions relating to self referrals  violations of which are punishable by criminal or civil penalties  including exclusion from medicare and other governmental programs 
unanticipated changes in healthcare programs or laws could require us to restructure our business practices which  in turn  could materially adversely affect our business  operations and financial condition 
see item  business government regulation 
we have developed a corporate integrity program to assure that we provide the highest level of patient care and services in a professional and ethical manner consistent with applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
among the different programs is our compliance program  which has been implemented to assure our compliance with fraud and abuse laws and to supplement our existing policies relating to claims submission  cost report preparation  initial audit and human resources  all geared towards a cost efficient operation beneficial to patients and shareholders 
see item  business corporate integrity program 
dialysis corporation of america s future growth depends primarily on the availability of suitable dialysis centers for development or acquisition in appropriate and acceptable areas  and our ability to manage the development costs for these potential dialysis centers while competing with larger companies  some of which are public companies or divisions of public companies with greater numbers of personnel and financial resources available for acquiring and or developing dialysis centers in areas targeted by us 
additionally  there is intense competition for qualified nephrologists who would serve as medical directors of dialysis facilities  and be responsible for the supervision of those dialysis centers 
there is no assurance as to when any new dialysis centers or inpatient service contracts with hospitals will be implemented  or the number of stations  or patient treatments such center or service contract may involve  or if such center or service contract will ultimately be profitable 
it has been our experience that newly established dialysis centers  although contributing to increased revenues  have adversely affected our results of operations in the short term due to start up costs and expenses and a smaller patient base 
results of operations the following table shows our results of operations in thousands and the percentage of medical service revenue represented by each line item for the periods presented year ended december  medical service revenue    interest and other income total revenues    cost of medical services    selling  general and administrative expenses    provision for doubtful accounts interest expense total cost and expenses    income before income taxes  minority interest and equity in affiliate earnings   income tax provision income before minority interest and equity in affiliate earnings   minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries equity in affiliate earnings loss net income   compared to medical service revenues increased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year with the increase largely attributable to a increase in total dialysis treatments performed by us from  in to  in this increase reflects increased revenues of approximately  for our pennsylvania dialysis centers  decreased revenues of  for our new jersey centers reflecting termination of our two new jersey acute care contracts during  increased revenues of  for our georgia centers  revenues of approximately  for our new maryland center  revenues of approximately  for our new ohio center  and a decrease in consulting and license income of approximately  interest and other income increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this includes an increase in interest income of  an increase in management fee income of  pursuant to management service agreements with our owned toledo  ohio affiliate and an unaffiliated georgia center with which we entered a management services agreement effective september  an increase in miscellaneous other income of  and an increase in rental income of cost of medical services sales as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the preceding year which increase is primarily attributable to costs for treatments at new dialysis centers prior to medicare approval of those centers for which there were no corresponding medical service revenues  increases in the cost of epo as a percentage of epo sales revenues  and increases in the cost of professional liability insurance 
the cost of our professional liability insurance coverage increased by  or for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
while a portion of this increase is attributable to our new centers and overall increase in treatments  a substantial portion of the cost increase relates to the general market conditions for professional liability coverage of reduced availability and higher costs for this coverage 
continued cost increases for professional liability coverage could adversely impact our earnings 
approximately of our medical services revenues for the year ended december  was derived from the administration of epo to our dialysis patients compared to for the preceding year 
this drug is only available from one manufacturer in the united states which raised the price for its product in january  continued price increases for this product without our ability to increase our charges would increase our costs and thereby adversely impact our earnings 
we cannot predict the timing  if any  or extent of any future price increases by the manufacturer  or our ability to offset any such increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses  those corporate and facility costs not directly related to the care of patients  including  among others  administration  accounting and billing  increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this increase reflects operations of our new dialysis centers in ohio and maryland  and increased support activities resulting from expanded operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of medical services revenues increased to approximately for the year ended december   compared to for the preceding year  including patient treatment expenses of new centers incurred prior to medicare approval for which there were no corresponding medical service revenues 
provision for doubtful accounts decreased approximately  largely as a result of medicare bad debt recoveries of approximately  during compared to approximately  for the preceding year 
without the effect of the medicare bad debt recoveries the provision would have amounted to of sales for the year ended december  compared to for the preceding year 
this change reflects our collection experience with the impact of that experience included in accounts receivable presently reserved  plus recovery of accounts previously considered uncollectible from our medicare cost report filings 
the provision for doubtful accounts is determined under a variety of criteria  primarily aging of the receivables and payor mix 
accounts receivable are estimated to be uncollectible based upon various criteria including the age of the receivable  historical collection trends and our understanding of the nature and collectibility of the receivables  and are reserved for in the allowance for doubtful accounts until they are written off 
although operations of additional centers have resulted in additional revenues  certain of these centers are still in the developmental stage and  accordingly  their operating results adversely impact our overall results of operations until they achieve a patient count sufficient to sustain profitable operations 
we experienced same center growth in total treatments of approximately in  and same center revenues grew approximately in fiscal management continues to search for ways to operate more efficiently and reduce costs through process improvements 
in addition  we are reviewing technological improvements and intend to make capital investments to the extent we are confident such improvements will improve patient care and operating performance 
interest expense decreased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year  reflecting lower interest rates on variable rate debt and reduced average borrowings by us 
minority interest represents the proportionate equity interests of minority owners of our subsidiaries whose financial results are included in our consolidated results 
the increase in minority interest resulted from financial improvements of the related subsidiaries 
equity in affiliate earnings represents our proportionate interest in the earnings of our owned ohio affiliate 
the prime rate was at december  and at december  accrued compensation of  was bonused to the board of directors relating to the exercise of a portion of their outstanding stock options  amounting to an aggregate of  shares acquired at exercise prices ranging from to 
compared to medical service revenues increased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this increase reflects increased revenues of our pennsylvania dialysis centers of approximately  including revenues of  for our new pennsylvania facility which commenced operations in january  decreased revenues of  for our new jersey centers reflecting a reduction in patients at one of our new jersey facilities and termination of our two new jersey acute care contracts  and increased revenues of  for our georgia centers  two of which became operational during which contributed  additional revenues in and another being acquired in april for which revenues amounted to  and a decrease in consulting and license income of approximately  interest and other income decreased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this includes a decrease in interest from our parent of  for the year ended december  compared to the preceding year  consisting of interest on a note receivable and an advance receivable  primarily due to our parent s repayment of the note  a decrease in other interest income of  primarily due to a decrease in average interest rates  an increase in management fee income of  pursuant to a management services agreement with our owned toledo  ohio affiliate and an unaffiliated georgia center with which we entered a management services agreement effective september  a decrease in miscellaneous other income of  and an increase in rental income of cost of medical services sales as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the preceding year as a result of decreases in both supply costs and payroll costs as a percentage of sales 
we receive approximately of our medical services revenues from the administration of epo to our patients 
this drug is only available from one manufacturer in the united states which raised its price for the product in january  continued price increases for this product without our ability to increase our charges would increase our costs and thereby adversely impact our earnings 
we cannot predict the price increases  if any  or the extent of such by the manufacturer  or our ability to offset any such increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses  those corporate and facility costs not directly related to the care of patients  including  among others  administration  accounting and billing  increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this increase reflects operations of our new dialysis center in pennsylvania  the georgia center acquired in april and a full year s operations for the two georgia centers opened during  and increased support activities resulting from expanded operations 
although selling  general and administrative expenses increased  as a percent of medical service revenues these expenses remained relatively constant amounting to for the year ended december   and for the preceding year 
provision for doubtful accounts increased approximately  largely as a result of increased sales revenues 
the provision remained relatively constant amounting to of sales for the year ended december  and for the preceding year 
the provision for doubtful accounts is determined under a variety of criteria  primarily aging of the receivables and payor mix

although operations of additional centers have resulted in additional revenues  some are still in the developmental stage and  accordingly  their operating results will adversely affect results of operations until they achieve a sufficient patient count to sustain profitable operations 
the company experienced same center growth in total treatments of approximately in same center revenues grew in fiscal the company made an acquisition in may of a facility in georgia that added to revenue 
management continues to search for ways to operate more efficiently and reduce costs through process improvements and improve our bottom line 
we are reviewing technological improvements as well  and will make the capital investment if we are confident such improvements will improve patient care and operating performance 
interest expense increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year primarily as a result of additional equipment financing agreements with the increase tempered to some extent by decreased interest rates 
the prime rate was at december  and at december  accrued compensation of approximately  was bonused to the board of directors on a pro rata basis for exercise of a portion of their options  amounting to  shares at exercise prices ranging from to  representing approximately of the directors aggregate options and approximately of all outstanding options 
liquidity and capital resources working capital totaled approximately  at december   which reflected a decrease of  during the current year 
included in the changes in components of working capital was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  which included net cash provided by operating activities of  net cash used in investing activities of  including additions to property and equipment of  acquisition payments to a minority member in two of our subsidiary dialysis centers to acquire an aggregate of of such member s interest in each of such subsidiaries   for the acquisition of a georgia dialysis center   in loans to physician affiliates  and  distributions received from our owned ohio affiliate  and net cash used in financing activities of  including an increase in advances to our parent of  debt repayments of   in capital contributions by a subsidiary minority member  distributions to subsidiary minority members of   for the repurchase of shares of our common stock and  of receipts from the exercise of stock options

our easton  maryland building has a mortgage to secure a development loan for our vineland  new jersey subsidiary  which loan is guaranteed by us 
this loan had a remaining principal balance of  at december  and  at december  in april   we obtained a  five year mortgage on our building in valdosta  georgia  which had an outstanding principal balance of approximately  at december  and  at december  see item  properties and note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have an equipment financing agreement for kidney dialysis machines for our facilities  which had an outstanding balance of approximately  at december   and  at december  there was no additional equipment financing during see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we opened centers in cincinnati  ohio and chevy chase  maryland in february  and acquired a center in georgia in april  we ceased operations at our homerville  georgia center during as a result of that center not performing up to expectations 
we opened three new centers in the first quarter of  one each in pennsylvania  virginia and south carolina  and we are in the process of constructing a new center in maryland 
capital is needed primarily for the development of outpatient dialysis centers 
the construction of a station facility  typically the size of our dialysis facilities  costs in the range of  to  depending on location  size and related services to be provided  which includes equipment and initial working capital requirements 
acquisition of an existing dialysis facility is more expensive than construction  although acquisition would provide us with an immediate ongoing operation  which most likely would be generating income 
we presently plan to expand our operations primarily through construction of new centers  rather than acquisition 
development of a dialysis facility to initiate operations takes four to six months and usually up to months or longer to generate income 
we consider some of our centers to be in the developmental stage since they have not developed a patient base sufficient to generate and sustain earnings 
we are seeking to expand our outpatient dialysis treatment facilities and inpatient dialysis care and are presently in different phases of negotiations with physicians for the development of additional outpatient centers 
such expansion requires capital 
we have been funding our expansion through internally generated cash flow 
our future expansion may require us to seek outside financing 
while we anticipate that financing will be available either from a financial institution or our parent company  medicore  which is currently providing us with equipment financing  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategy or that adequate financing will be available to support our expansion

critical accounting policies and estimates in december   the sec issued a cautionary advice to elicit more precise disclosure in this item  md a  about accounting policies management believes are most critical in portraying the company s financial results and in requiring management s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments and estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  the most significant of which include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and determining the recoverability of our long lived assets 
the basis for our estimates are historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  given the available information at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized net of contractual provisions 
contractual provisions are the difference between our gross billed revenues and what we expect to collect 
we receive payments through reimbursement from medicare and medicaid for our outpatient dialysis treatments coupled with patients private payments  individually and through private third party insurers 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from the medicare ersd program  which outpatient reimbursement rates are fixed under a composite rate structure  which includes the dialysis services and certain supplies  drugs and laboratory tests 
certain of these ancillary services are reimbursable outside of the composite rate 
medicaid reimbursement is similar and supplemental to the medicare program 
our acute inpatient dialysis operations are paid under contractual arrangements  usually at higher contractually established rates  as are certain of the private pay insurers for outpatient dialysis 
we have developed a sophisticated information and computerized coding system  but due to the complexity of the payor mix and regulations  we sometimes receive more or less than the amount expected when the services are provided 
we reconcile any differences at least quarterly 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our patients or their insurance carriers to make required payments 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
changes in general economic  business and market conditions could result in an impairment in the ability of our patients and the insurance companies to make their required payments  which would have an adverse effect on cash flows and our results of operations 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated based on actual collection experience 
we use a combination of percentage of sales and the aging of accounts receivable to establish an allowance for losses on accounts receivable 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the carrying value of deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which could result in additional income tax expense 
long lived assets we state our property and equipment at acquisition cost and compute depreciation for book purposes by the straight line method over estimated useful lives of the assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
these computations are complex and subjective 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this impairment test requires the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment changes for these assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas effective january   and are required to analyze goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis 
impact of inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our operations 
a substantial portion of our revenue is subject to reimbursement rates established and regulated by the federal government 
these rates do not automatically adjust for inflation 
any rate adjustments relate to legislation and executive and congressional budget demands  and have little to do with the actual cost of doing business 
see operations medicare reimbursement  government regulation  and risk factors under item  business 
therefore  dialysis services revenues cannot be voluntary increased to keep pace with increases in nursing and other patient care costs 
increased operating costs without a corresponding increase in reimbursement rates may adversely affect our earnings in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not consider our exposure to market risks  principally changes in interest rates  to be significant 
sensitivity of results of operations to interest rate risks on our investments is managed by conservatively investing funds in liquid interest bearing accounts of which we held approximately  december  interest rate risk on debt is managed by negotiation of appropriate rates for equipment financing and other fixed rate obligations based on current market rates 
there is an interest rate risk associated with our variable rate mortgage obligations  which totaled approximately  at december  on march   we issued a demand promissory note to our parent  medicore  for up to  of financing for equipment purchases at an interest rate of over the prime rate 
variable rate debt may result in higher costs to us if interest rates rise 
we have exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
assuming a relative decrease in rates on our year end investments in interest bearing accounts and a relative increase in rates on our year end variable rate mortgage debt would result in a negative annual impact of approximately  on our results of operations 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently use interest rate derivatives
