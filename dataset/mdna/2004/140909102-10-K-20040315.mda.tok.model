we operate in three business segments 
the paperboard segment manufactures recycled uncoated and clay coated paperboard and collects recycled paper and brokers recycled paper and other paper rolls 
the tube  core and composite container segment produces spiral and convolute wound tubes  cores and cans 
the carton and custom packaging segment produces printed and unprinted folding carton and set up boxes and provides contract manufacturing and packaging services 
our business is vertically integrated to a large extent 
this means that our converting operations consume a large portion of our own paperboard production  approximately in the remaining of our paperboard production is sold to external customers in any of the four recycled paperboard end use markets tube  core and composite containers  folding cartons  gypsum wallboard facing paper and other specialty products 
these integration statistics do not include volume produced or converted by our owned  unconsolidated  joint ventures premier boxboard limited and standard gypsum  llp 
as part of our strategy to optimize our operating efficiency  each of our mills can produce recycled paperboard for more than one end use market 
this allows us to shift production among mills in response to customer or market demands 
recovered fiber  which is derived from recycled paper stock  is our most significant raw material 
historically  the cost of recovered fiber has fluctuated significantly due to market and industry conditions 
for example  our average recovered fiber cost per ton of paperboard produced increased from per ton in to per ton in  an increase of  before dropping to per ton in recovered fiber cost per ton averaged and during and  respectively 
we raise our selling prices in response to increases in raw material costs 
however  we often are unable to pass the full amount of these costs through to our customers on a timely basis due to supply and demand in the industry  and as a result often cannot maintain our operating margins in the face of dramatic cost increases 
we experience margin shrinkage during all periods of cost increases due to customary time lags in implementing our price increases 
we cannot give assurance that we will be able to recover any future increases in the cost of recovered fiber by raising the prices of our products 
even if we are able to recover future cost increases  our operating margins and results of operations may still be materially and adversely affected by time delays in the implementation of price increases 
see part i  item  risk factors our business and financial performance may be harmed by future increases in raw material costs 
excluding raw materials and labor  energy is our most significant manufacturing cost 
energy consists of electrical purchases and fuel used to generate steam used in the paper making process and to operate our paperboard machines and all of our converting machinery 
in  the average energy cost in our mill system was approximately per ton compared to per ton in  a decline 
in energy costs averaged per ton  an increase of from until the last few years  our business had not been significantly affected by energy cost increases  and we historically have not passed increases in energy costs through to our customers 
consequently  we have not been able to pass through to our customers all of the energy cost increases we have incurred 
as a result  our operating margins have been adversely affected 
although we continue to evaluate our energy costs and consider ways to factor energy costs into our pricing  we cannot give assurance that our operating margins and results of operations will not continue to be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
see part i  item  risk factors our operating margins may be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
historically  we have grown our business  revenues and production capacity to a significant degree through acquisitions 
based on the difficult operating climate for our industry and our financial position over the last three years  the pace of our acquisition activity  and correspondingly  our revenue growth  has slowed as we have focused on conserving cash and maximizing the productivity of our existing facilities 
during the third quarter of  we acquired certain operating assets excluding accounts receivable of smurfit stone s industrial packaging group 
in addition  during the first quarter of we completed the purchase of our venture partner s interest in caraustar northwest  llc located in tacoma  wa 
see liquidity and capital resources acquisitions 
we are a holding company that currently operates our business through subsidiaries 
we also own a interest in two joint ventures with temple inland  inc we account for these interests in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
critical accounting policies our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves forming estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from financial results reported based on management s current estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue and the related account receivable when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ownership has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
generally  we recognize revenue when we ship our manufactured products or when we complete a service and title and risk of loss passes to our customers 
provisions for discounts  returns  allowances  customer rebates and other adjustments are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
accounts receivable 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we periodically monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
during the second quarter of one of our significant carton customers  spalding sports  filed chapter bankruptcy unexpectedly  and we were required to write off uncollectible accounts receivable of million  net of the million recovery recorded in the third quarter of inventory 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management reviews inventory at least quarterly to determine the necessity of write offs for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
we reserve for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on management s judgment of future realization 
these reviews require management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the write offs required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
goodwill 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this pronouncement requires us to perform a goodwill impairment test at least annually 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
evaluating the impairment of goodwill also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows  which also require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in conditions may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important that could initiate an impairment review include the following significant operating losses recurring operating losses significant declines in demand for a product produced by an asset capable of producing only that product assets that are idled or held for sale assets that are likely to be divested the impairment review requires management to estimate future undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset or group of assets and sum the estimated future cash flows 
if the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  then we must estimate the fair value of the asset 
if the fair value of the asset is below the carrying value  then the difference will be written off 
estimating future cash flows requires management to make judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of the asset or group of assets may materially affect our asset values and results of operations 
impairment costs of million were recorded in related to assets held for sale 
the costs represent the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value 
self insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and health care costs  subject to specific retention levels 
consulting actuaries and administrators assist us in determining our liability for self insured claims 
our self insured workers compensation liability is estimated based on actual claims as established by a third party administrator  increased by factors that reflect our historical claim development 
the developed claim  net of amounts paid  represents the liability that we record in our financial statements 
our self insured health care liability is estimated based on our actual claim experience and multiplied by a time lag factor 
the lag factor represents an estimate of claims that have been incurred and should be recorded as a liability  but have not been reported 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses carried forward and state tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have a material negative impact on our statement of operations and our balance sheet 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan the pension plan 
the pension plan provides benefits to be paid to all eligible employees at retirement based primarily on years of service with the company and compensation rates in effect near retirement 
our policy is to fund benefits attributed to employees services to date as well as service expected to be earned in the future 
during september  the maximum deductible contribution of million was made to the pension plan relating to the plan year 
based on our current estimate of future funding requirements  we do not expect to make a contribution during the year ended december  during  we adopted a supplemental executive retirement plan serp  which provides benefits to certain named participants based on average compensation 
the serp covers certain executives of the company commencing upon retirement 
the serp was unfunded at december  the determination of our pension benefit obligation and expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the weighted average discount rate  the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets and the weighted average rate of compensation increase 
the following table is a summary of the significant assumptions we used to determine our projected benefit obligation as of december  weighted average discount rate weighted average rate of compensation increase the following table is a summary of the significant assumptions to determine net periodic pension expense for the years ended december  weighted average discount rate weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets weighted average rate of compensation increase in developing the weighted average discount rate  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including estimated timing of obligation payments and yields for long term bonds that received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate  determined on this basis  was lowered from at december  to at december  based on analysis of the rating and maturity of the long term bonds  the timing of payment obligations and the input from our actuaries  we concluded that a discount rate of is appropriate and reflects the yield of a portfolio of high quality bonds that has the same duration as the plan obligations 
future actual pension expense and benefit obligations will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to populations participating in our pension plans 
a change in the discount rate would result in a change in the december  projected benefit obligation of approximately million and estimated net pension expense of approximately thousand 
in developing our weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets  we evaluated such criteria as return expectations by asset class and long term inflation assumptions 
our expected weighted average rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of equity and fixed income 
we regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that the expected weighted average rate of return of for december  is appropriate 
a change in the weighted average expected rate of return would change estimated net pension expense thousand 
the investment performance during  combined with the million contribution  decreased our under funded status of the pension plan and the serp plan by approximately million in while we believe that the assumptions we have used are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension plan and serp liability 
we also provide postretirement medical benefits at certain of our subsidiaries 
our net periodic postretirement benefit cost for medical costs was approximately thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at december  and were determined using a weighted average discount rate of and  respectively 
the rate of increase in the costs of covered health care benefits is assumed to be in  decreasing each year to by the year increasing the assumed health care costs trend rate by one percentage point would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately thousand and would have increased net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately thousand for the year ended december  depreciation 
management is required to make estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of long lived assets 
these estimates can significantly affect depreciation expense and accordingly  both results of operations and the asset values reflected on the balance sheet 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed  with the assistance from independent professional valuation advisors  a comprehensive review of the remaining estimated useful lives of our machinery and equipment 
as a result of this review  we revised our estimate of the useful lives for production machinery and equipment from an average of approximately years to an average of approximately years 
we believe that the change more appropriately reflects the useful lives of the assets 
the effect of this change in estimated useful lives has been accounted for on a prospective basis 
the estimated impact of this change was a decrease in depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of of approximately million and a decrease of million in results of operations the following table shows volume  gross paper margins and related data for the periods indicated 
the volume information shown below includes shipments of unconverted paperboard and converted paperboard products 
tonnage volumes from our business segments  excluding tonnage produced or converted by our unconsolidated joint ventures  are combined and presented along end use market lines

total paperboard tonnage for was nearly flat  increasing only from likewise  tons sold from paperboard mill production increased by only in total tonnage converted increased in the positive effects on tonnage were primarily related to higher internal conversion by our tube  core and composite container segment 
the higher conversion was primarily driven by the tube and core plants acquired in september higher internal conversion by our other specialty converting operations  primarily the partition plants that were acquired in september of these improvements were largely offset by a decrease in internal conversion by our folding carton operations due to weak demand 
a decrease in sales of unconverted paperboard to the gypsum wallboard facing paper end use market 
this decrease was primarily due to the transfer of volume from our buffalo paperboard mill  which was closed in march  to our owned  unconsolidated  premier boxboard joint venture 
including the volume from premier boxboard  gypsum volume increased to thousand tons in compared with thousand tons for the same period in the decision to stop serving certain customers in conjunction with idling one of the two coated recycled paperboard machines at our rittman  ohio facility 
a decrease in sales of unconverted paperboard to the folding carton end use market due to weak demand in that end use market 
sales 
our consolidated sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the following table presents sales by business segment in thousands for the year ended december  change change paperboard tube  core and composite container carton and custom packaging total paperboard segment sales for the paperboard segment decreased primarily due to lower sales from our coated paperboard mill operations 
these decreases were partially offset by sales from acquisitions and higher selling prices 
tube  core and composite container segment sales for the tube  core and composite container segment increased primarily due to acquisitions and higher selling prices 
carton and custom packaging segment sales for the carton and custom packaging segment declined due to a decrease in volume  lower selling prices and lower contract packaging sales 
gross profit margin 
gross profit margin for decreased to of sales from in this margin decrease was due primarily to the following costs to consolidate and reconfigure operations 
higher energy  insurance and pension costs 
higher inventory write offs and lower selling prices in the carton and custom packaging segment 
these factors were partially offset by lower depreciation expense and higher gross paper margins in the paperboard segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of from the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was the result of the following selling  general and administrative expenses associated with acquired locations 
higher pension and insurance costs 
higher expense related to uncollectible accounts receivable 
cost of idling one of the two coated recycled paperboard machines at our rittman  ohio facility 
costs of consolidating operations  including the downsizing and the eventual closure of the ashland carton facility 
these increases were partially offset by reductions through savings initiatives  including facility closures 
restructuring and impairment costs 
in march  we announced the permanent closure of our buffalo paperboard mill located  in lockport  new york 
we recorded a charge of approximately million in connection with this closure 
the majority of the buffalo mills sales were transferred to our other paperboard mills and our premier boxboard joint venture 
in june  we initiated a plan to permanently close our ashland  ohio carton facility 
we recorded a charge of million in connection with this closure 
we restructured this facility in december  however  due to severe margin pressure and excess industry capacity  the aggressive downsizing undertaken in december was unsuccessful so the facility was permanently closed 
in december  we recorded a thousand asset impairment charge related to the closing of the hendersonville tube and core facility located in hendersonville  north carolina  a thousand asset impairment charge related to the closing of the jacksonville tube and core facility located in jacksonville  florida and a thousand asset impairment charge related to the closure of the halifax recycling plant located in roanoke rapids  north carolina 
in june  we recorded a thousand noncash  pretax restructuring charge related to the permanent closure of our camden and chicago paperboard mills  which were shut down in and  respectively 
the thousand charge represents a revised estimate of fixed asset disposals at these mills 
in we recorded an additional thousand asset impairment charge and an additional thousand related to other exit costs 
in december  we initiated a plan to restructure our carton plant in ashland  ohio to serve a smaller  more focused carton market and recorded a pretax charge to operations of approximately million

equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates was million in  an improvement of million over this increase was primarily due to improved operating results for premier boxboard limited  our paper mill joint venture with temple inland 
the improved results were due primarily to an increase in gross paper margins and volume and lower depreciation expense 
standard gypsum s results declined slightly in compared to primarily due to increased raw material and energy costs  which were partially offset by increased volume and lower depreciation expense 
benefit for income taxes 
the effective rate of income tax benefit for the year ended december  was compared with for the same period last year

benefit for income taxes 
the effective rate of income tax benefit for the year ended december  was compared with for the effective rates for both periods are different from the statutory rates due to permanent tax adjustments net loss 
for the reasons discussed above  net loss was million in  or net loss per common share compared with a net loss of million  or net loss per common share in liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources and risks 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility  described below 
downturns in operations can significantly affect our ability to generate cash 
factors that can affect our operating results and liquidity are discussed further in this annual report under risk factors in part i  item in  we generated million in cash from operations  which is million lower than although the timing or certainty of the following events cannot be assured  we believe that our existing cash and liquidity position will be strengthened through the sale of the real estate at our chicago  illinois and baltimore  maryland paperboard mills and internal cost reduction initiatives 
we believe that our cash on hand at december  of million and borrowing availability under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the year ended december  additionally  based on our historical ability to generate cash  we believe we will be able to meet our long term cash requirements 
however  if we are unable to generate cash at historic levels our ability to generate cash sufficient to meet long term requirements is uncertain 
the following are factors that could impact our future ability to generate cash from operations continued contraction in domestic demand for recycled paperboard and related packaging products that our industry experienced in and substitution of paperboard packaging products by alternative products such as flexible packaging and plastics 
continued export of domestic manufacturing operations to countries where the costs of manufacturing are lower 
significant unforeseen adverse conditions in our industry or the markets we serve 
although we believe that our liquidity will be sufficient to meet expected needs for the foreseeable future  we could require additional funds from external sources 
the availability of liquidity from borrowings is primarily affected by our continued compliance with the terms of the agreement governing our senior credit facility  including the payment of interest and compliance with various covenants and financial maintenance tests 
we were in compliance with the covenants under our senior credit facility during absent further material deterioration of the us economy as a whole or the specific sectors on which our business depends see part i  item  risk factors our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by downturns in industrial production  housing and construction and the consumption of durable and nondurable goods  we believe it is likely that we will be in compliance with our covenants under the senior credit agreement during borrowings 
at december  and  total debt consisting of current maturities of debt and long term debt  as reported on our consolidated balance sheets was as follows in thousands senior credit facility senior subordinated notes senior notes senior notes other notes payable mark to market value of interest swap agreements realized interest rate swap gains total debt net of original issuance discounts and accumulated discount amortization 
as described below under interest rate swap agreements  realized gains resulting from unwinding interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of debt and will be accreted as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt 
effective june   we completed a refinancing of our senior credit facility 
the new facility provides for a revolving line of credit of million and is secured primarily by a first priority security interest in our accounts receivable and inventory 
the facility matures in june borrowing availability is subject to borrowing base requirements established by eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the facility includes a subfacility of million for letters of credit  usage of which reduces availability under the facility 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility  however  an aggregate of million in letter of credit obligations were outstanding 
availability under the facility at december  was limited to million after taking into consideration outstanding letter of credit obligations and minimum borrowing availability requirements 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option  either the base rate which is the prime rate most recently announced by bank of america  na  the administrative agent under the facility plus a margin of or the adjusted eurodollar interbank offered rate plus a margin of 
the undrawn portion of the facility is subject to a facility fee at an annual rate of 
outstanding letters of credit are subject to an annual fee equal to the applicable margin for eurodollar based loans 
the facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability and our subsidiaries ability to create liens  merge or consolidate  dispose of assets  incur indebtedness and guarantees  pay dividends  repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness  make certain investments or acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  make capital expenditures in excess of million per year or change the nature of our business 
the facility also contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant  which applies only in the event borrowing availability falls below million or suppressed availability falls below million

see subsequent events regarding the unwind of the million interest rate swap in march off balance sheet arrangements joint venture financings 
as noted above  we own a interest in two joint ventures with temple inland  inc standard gypsum  lp and premier boxboard limited llc 
because we account for these interests in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting  the indebtedness of these joint ventures is not reflected in the liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheets 
standard gypsum manufactures gypsum wallboard  and premier boxboard is a low cost recycled paperboard mill that produces a lightweight gypsum facing paper along with containerboard grades 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for summarized financial information for these joint ventures 
standard gypsum is the obligor under reimbursement agreements pursuant to which direct pay letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately million were originally issued for its account in support of industrial revenue bond obligations 
standard gypsum replaced these letters of credit in october with new direct pay letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  issued by a replacement lender 
we are severally obligated for of standard gypsum s obligations for reimbursement of letter of credit drawings  interest  fees and other amounts 
the other standard gypsum partner  temple inland  has guaranteed of standard gypsum s obligations 
as of december   the outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately million  for one half of which we are obligated approximately million 
if either joint venture partner had defaulted under its support arrangements  our total obligation would have been million at december  as of december   our obligation with respect to these letters of credit is supported by a letter of credit in the face amount of million  issued in favor of the standard gypsum lender 
this letter of credit was issued under our senior credit facility and expires on october  the letter of credit may be drawn in the event of a default under the standard gypsum reimbursement agreement  and such a default would be triggered by  among other things  our failure to renew or extend this letter of credit 
in the event we are unable to renew  extend or otherwise replace this letter of credit  the lender under the standard gypsum facility would be entitled to draw under the letter of credit to satisfy our support obligations  and we would then be obligated to reimburse our senior lenders for the amount of such drawing 
premier boxboard is the borrower under a credit facility  the aggregate principal amount of which was reduced from million to million pursuant to an amendment completed on march  pursuant to this amendment  the maturity date of the facility was shortened from june  to january  on december   an additional amendment was completed that extended the maturity date of the facility to january  we are severally obligated for of premier boxboard s obligations for reimbursement letter of credit drawings  interest  fees and other amounts 
temple inland has guaranteed of premier boxboard s obligations 
as of december   the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the facility was approximately million including a thousand undrawn letter of credit  for one half of which we are obligated approximately million 
if either joint venture partner had defaulted under its support arrangements  our total obligation would have been million at december  our obligation is supported by a letter of credit in the face amount of million  issued in favor of the premier boxboard lenders 
this letter of credit was issued in june under our new senior credit facility in replacement of a guarantee agreement  and expires in january any reductions of outstanding loans under the premier boxboard credit facility may not be reborrowed and will permanently reduce the commitments 
the reduction of the commitments under this credit facility eliminates availability for borrowings unless we are able to reduce outstandings under the facility  and effectively requires us to fund premier boxboard s operations from its internal cash flow and from any cash contributions that we and our joint venture partner are permitted to make 
if we are not able to fund premier boxboard s operations in this manner  its performance could be adversely affected 
further  if we are unable to refinance this facility prior to january   the entire facility would become immediately due and payable and the lenders under the premier boxboard facility would be entitled to draw under the letter of credit to satisfy our support obligations 
in the event that we were called upon to reimburse drawings under either or both of our joint venture letter of credit support obligations  we believe that we would be able to satisfy such obligations by having our senior lenders treat these reimbursement obligations as revolving credit loans under our senior credit agreement 
the full million of these letter of credit obligations and other letter of credit obligations outstanding as of december  has already been included in determining the million in borrowing availability under our senior credit facility as of december  our cash on hand is also a potential source of repayment of some or all of these reimbursement obligations 
however  we can give no assurance that we will be able to obtain  on a timely basis  the renewals  extensions or refinancings necessary to avoid being called upon to satisfy either or both of our joint venture support obligations  or that we will be able to reimburse our senior lenders in the event of drawings under one or both of the letters of credit 
any resulting acceleration and default in repayment of these support obligations could cause defaults and acceleration under our senior subordinated notes  our senior notes and our senior notes 
in addition to the general default risks discussed above with respect to the joint ventures  a substantial portion of the assets of premier boxboard are pledged as security for million in outstanding principal amount of senior notes under which premier boxboard is the obligor 
these notes are guaranteed by temple inland  but are not guaranteed by us 
a default under the premier boxboard credit facility would also constitute an event of default under these notes 
in the event of default under these notes  the holders would also have recourse to the assets of premier boxboard that are pledged to secure these notes 
thus  any resulting default under these notes could result in the assets of premier boxboard being utilized to satisfy creditor claims  which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operations of premier boxboard and  accordingly  our interest in premier boxboard 
further  in such an event of default  these assets would not be available to satisfy obligations owing to unsecured creditors of premier boxboard  including the lenders under the credit facility  which might make it more likely that our guarantee of the premier boxboard credit facility would be the primary source of repayment under the facility in the event premier boxboard cannot pay 
additional contingencies relating to our joint ventures that could affect our liquidity include possible additional capital contributions and buy sell triggers which  under certain circumstances  give us and our joint venture partner either the right  or the obligation  to purchase the other s interest or to sell an interest to the other 
in the case of both standard gypsum and premier boxboard  neither joint venture partner is obligated or required to make additional capital contributions without the consent of both partners 
with regard to buy sell rights  under the standard gypsum joint venture  in general  either party may purchase the other s interest upon the occurrence of certain purported unauthorized transfers or involuntary transfer events such as bankruptcy 
in addition  under the standard gypsum joint venture  either i in the event of an unresolved deadlock over a material matter or ii at any time  either party may initiate a russian roulette buyout procedure by which it names a price at which the other party must agree either to sell its interest to the initiating party or to purchase the initiating party s interest 
under the premier boxboard joint venture  in general  mutual buy sell rights are triggered upon the occurrence of certain purported unauthorized or involuntary transfers  but in the event of certain change of control or deadlock events  the buy sell rights are structured such that we are always the party entitled  or obligated  as the case may be  to purchase 
we generally consider our relationship with temple inland to be good with respect to both of our joint ventures and currently do not anticipate experiencing material liquidity events resulting from either additional capital contributions or buy sell contingencies with respect to our joint ventures during however  in light of the recent amendments to the premier boxboard credit facility  as described above  we could be required to fund premier boxboard s operations with additional cash contributions to the extent it is unable to fund operations with internally generated cash 
we cannot give assurance that material liquidity events will not arise with respect to our joint ventures  and the occurrence of any such events could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total total does not include certain obligations under purchase orders as discussed below 
purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  purchase obligations are defined as agreements for purchase of goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on caraustar and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transactions 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
cash from operations 
cash generated from operations was million for the year ended december   compared with million in the decrease in compared to the same period in was due primarily to lower operating results  partially offset by a reduction in working capital 
the reduction in working capital is the result of management initiatives to reduce inventory  lengthen payment terms to vendors to be more consistent with industry averages and improve collections of accounts receivable 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million in versus million in aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million are anticipated for to conserve cash  we intend to limit capital expenditures for to cost reduction  productivity improvement and replacement projects 
acquisitions 
in april  we acquired the remaining of the outstanding stock of design tubes company limited design tubes  toronto  ontario  canada in consideration for shares of a subsidiary exchangeable at the holder s option for no additional consideration for approximately thousand shares of our common stock  valued at million 
we originally acquired our minority interest in design tubes in november and accounted for our ownership using the equity method 
design tubes manufactures paperboard tubes and also produces paper tube manufacturing equipment for companies throughout north america 
goodwill in the amount of million was recorded in the connection with the design tubes acquisition 
on september   we acquired certain operating assets excluding accounts receivable of the smurfit industrial packaging group  a business unit of jefferson smurfit corporation us  for approximately million  and assumed million of indebtedness outstanding under certain industrial revenue bonds 
the acquisition was funded with cash on hand 
goodwill and intangible assets of approximately million were recorded in conjunction with the smurfit industrial packaging group acquisition 
smurfit industrial packaging group operations included paper tube and core plants  uncoated recycled paperboard mills and partition manufacturing plants 
these facilities are located in states across the us and in canada 
dividends 
in february  we announced that we would suspend future dividend payments on our common stock until our earnings performance and cash flow performance improve 
as described under liquidity and capital resources  our debt agreements contain certain limitations on the payment of dividends and currently preclude us from doing so 
inflation raw material and energy cost changes have had  and continue to have  a material negative effect on our operations 
we do not believe that general economic inflation is a significant determinant of our raw material and energy cost increases or that it has a material effect on our operations 
subsequent events on january   we announced the closure of the cedartown paperboard mill located in cedartown  georgia 
all of the paperboard produced at this facility had been consumed internally by our converting operations 
the paperboard production will be transitioned to our other paperboard mills 
this closure is not expected to have a significant impact on our operations and is expected to improve operating results and capacity utilization 
in march  we unwound one of our two million interest rate swap agreements related to our senior subordinated notes and received approximately thousand from the bank counter party 
the thousand gain will be recorded as a component of debt and will be accreted to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

this pronouncement requires recording costs associated with exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a liability has been incurred 
under previous guidance  certain exit costs were accrued upon management s commitment to an exit plan  which was generally before an actual liability had been incurred 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  and are accounting for exit and disposal activities initiated during in accordance with this pronouncement 
the adoption of this statement has resulted in the accrual of liabilities as incurred
