item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  market and sell integrated classroom based  print and online products and services to students  parents  educators and educational institutions 
we operate our businesses through three divisions 
our test preparation services division provides classroom based and princeton review online test preparation courses and tutoring and admissions counseling services and receives royalties from our independent franchisees who provide classroom based courses under the princeton review brand

however  as revenue from our newer businesses has grown  we returned to profitability and were profitable for the year ended december  during this period  the percentage of our revenue derived from our newer businesses has also increased from in to in in order to sustain and increase profitability we will need to continue to grow the percentage of revenue we derive from these newer businesses  while effectively controlling costs

 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of we have performed the required tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and  based on the results  have not recorded any charges related to the adoption of and subsequent conformity with sfas no 
our results do not reflect the provisions of sfas no 
had we adopted sfas no 
on january  and ceased to amortize goodwill and territorial marketing rights at such date  our historical net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share would have been as follows year ended december  in thousands  except per share data reported net loss goodwill amortization  net of tax territorial marketing rights amortization  net of tax adjusted net loss reported basic and diluted net loss per share goodwill amortization territorial marketing rights amortization adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
in most instances  sfas no 
will require gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under fasb statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
this provision of sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we adopted sfas no 
as of january  accordingly  we reclassified the million loss on extinguishment of debt previously classified as an extraordinary item in to conform to the provisions of sfas no 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses revenue recognition on arrangements encompassing multiple elements that are delivered at different points in time  defining criteria that must be met for elements to be considered to be a separate unit of accounting 
if an element is determined to be a separate unit of accounting  the revenue for the element is recognized at the time of delivery 
we recognize revenue in accordance with eitf in january  the fasb released interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that all primary beneficiaries of variable interest entities vie consolidate that entity 
fin is effective immediately for vies created after january  and to vies to which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to vies in which an enterprise holds a variable interest it acquired before february  in december  the fasb published a revision to fin fin r to clarify some of the provisions of the interpretation and defer to the effective date of implementation for certain entities 
under the guidance of fin r  entities that do not have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities are required to apply the provisions of the interpretation in financial statements for periods ending after march  we do not have any arrangements with variable interest entities that require consolidation of their financial information into our financial statements 
fin is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements or liquidity 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which requires that certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  including mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  be classified as a liability 
any amounts paid or to be paid to holders of these financial instruments in excess of the initial measurement amount shall be reflected in interest cost 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise shall be effective at the beginning of a company s first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of a nonpublic entity  in which case sfas no 
shall be effective for existing or new contracts for periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the estimates  methods and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies significantly impact the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make subjective and difficult judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances  which impacts bad debt write offs  recoverability of goodwill  which impacts write offs of goodwill  valuation of non marketable equity securities  which impacts gains losses on equity securities when we record impairments  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating margin when we impair assets or accelerate their depreciation  and recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on certain contracts 
however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we review our aged receivables monthly 
this review includes discussions with our customers and their account representatives  the customers payment history and other factors 
based on these reviews we may increase or decrease our allowance for bad debt if we determine there is a change in the collectability of our accounts receivable 
goodwill 
in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill as of the beginning of  we completed a goodwill impairment review for the reporting units that have substantially all of our recognized goodwill 
according to our accounting policy  we also performed an annual review during the fourth quarter of and  and found no impairment 
we will perform a similar review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses our estimates of revenue for the reporting units  driven by assumed market growth rates as well as appropriate discount rates 
these estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses 
we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future if our admissions services division s products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if we fail to achieve our assumed revenue growth 
non marketable equity securities 
our ability to recover our investments in private  non marketable equity securities and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute their business plans and how well their products are accepted  as well as their ability to obtain funding to continue operations and to grow 
in the equity market environment of recent periods  their ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers and private sales  has been significantly constrained 
under our accounting policy  the carrying value of a non marketable investment is the amount paid for the investment unless it has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
the impairment analysis for non marketable securities requires significant judgment 
this analysis includes assessment of each investee s financial condition  its projected results and cash flows  the business outlook for its products and technology  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or other parties 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
during  we recorded impairments of non marketable equity investments of  no impairment was recorded in long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
income taxes 
in determining income for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as of december   we believe that all of our recorded deferred tax assets will ultimately be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 
seasonality in results of operations we experience  and we expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our revenue because the markets in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuations based on the scheduled dates for standardized admissions tests and the typical school year 
these fluctuations could result in volatility or adversely affect our stock price 
we typically generate the largest portion of our test preparation revenue in the third quarter 
the electronic application revenue recorded in our admissions services division is highest in the first and fourth quarters  corresponding with the busiest times of year for submission of applications to academic institutions 
our k services division may also experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue  but we are not yet able to predict the impact of seasonal factors on this business with any degree of accuracy 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our portfolio of marketable securities includes primarily short term money market funds 
the fair value of our portfolio of marketable securities would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due primarily to the short term nature of the portfolio 
our outstanding long term debt bears interest at fixed rates 
we do not currently hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
revenue from our international operations and royalty payments from our international franchisees constitute an insignificant percentage of our revenue 
accordingly  our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is minimal
