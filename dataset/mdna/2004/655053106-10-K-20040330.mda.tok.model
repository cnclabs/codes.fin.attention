critical accounting policies a summary of the critical accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follow below 
property  plant and equipment 
the company s automotive operations are highly capital intensive 
property  plant and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is provided for using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from to years for buildings and improvements and to years for machinery and equipment 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
the company capitalizes interest cost associated with construction in progress 
capitalized interest costs in and were million and million  respectively 
the company periodically reviews the realization of long lived assets  based on an evaluation of remaining useful lives and the current and expected future profitability and cash flows related to such assets 
land is carried at acquisition cost 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
because the company operates in different geographic locations  including several state and local tax jurisdictions  the nature of the company s tax provisions and the evaluation of the company s ability to use all recognized deferred tax assets are complex 
in assessing the ability to realize such deferred tax assets  the company reviews the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the projections of taxable income in future periods and the effectiveness of various tax planning strategies in making assessments 
the consideration of these matters requires significant management judgment in determining deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
while it is believed that the appropriate valuations of deferred tax assets has been made  unforeseen changes in tax legislation  regulatory activities  operating results  financing strategies  organization structure and other related matters may result in material changes in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowances

at adoption and at june and june  the company determined that goodwill was not impaired

in march  the company completed the sale of the logistics operations for approximately million in cash and notes 
on january  the company completed the sale of the distribution business for approximately million in cash 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management makes these estimates based on an analysis of accounts receivable using available information on our customers financial status and payment histories 
historically  with the exception of million of bad debt expense recorded in related to the national steel bankruptcy and million in related to the rouge steel bankruptcy  bad debt losses have not been significant or have not differed materially from the company s estimates 
the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was million and  respectively 
inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the interest expense of floating rate indebtedness and by increasing the cost of labor  fuel  equipment and raw materials 
the company does not believe that inflation has had any material effect on its business over the past three years
