table of contents overview autonation  inc is the largest automotive retailer in the united states 
as of december   we owned and operated new vehicle franchises from dealerships located in major metropolitan markets in states  predominantly in the sunbelt region of the united states 
our stores  which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets  sell different brands of new vehicles 
the core brands of vehicles that we sell  representing approximately of the new vehicles that we sold in  are manufactured by ford  general motors  daimler chrysler  toyota  nissan  honda and bmw 
we offer a diversified range of automotive products and services  including new vehicles  used vehicles  vehicle maintenance and repair services  vehicle parts  extended service contracts  vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products 
we also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources 
we believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by  among other things  reducing operating expenses  leveraging our market brands and advertising  improving asset management and sharing and implementing best practices across all of our stores 
the automotive retailing industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation characterized by periods of oversupply of new vehicles and weak consumer demand 
we believe that many factors affect industry wide sales of new vehicles and retailers gross profit margins  including  among other factors  consumer confidence in the economy  the level of manufacturers excess production capacity  manufacturer incentives and consumers reaction to such offers  intense industry competition  interest rates and the level of personal discretionary spending 
for the years ended december  and  we had net income from continuing operations of million and million  respectively  and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of and  respectively 
our results of operations in benefited from an internal revenue service irs settlement which resulted in the recognition of an income tax benefit of million and the leveraging of our cost structure 
additionally  our earnings per share benefited from our repurchase of outstanding shares 
during  we experienced a decrease in new vehicle volume due to lower consumer demand in certain markets in which we operate and for certain brands sold by us 
we experienced downward pressure on our new vehicle gross profit margins during  which we believe was largely due to manufacturers excess production capacity and intense competition in the industry 
while we anticipate that the new vehicle market will remain intensely competitive in and that manufacturers will look to reduce incentives offered to consumers  we expect that an improving economic environment will stabilize both new vehicle volumes and margins 
however  the level of retail sales and gross profit for is very difficult to predict 
also  benefited from increased finance and insurance revenue and gross profit due to increased product penetration and lower interest rates 
significantly higher interest rates in may negatively impact finance and insurance revenue and gross profit 
the following factors have impacted our financial condition and results of operations in and may cause our reported financial data not to be indicative of our future financial condition and operating results income taxes in  we entered into a settlement agreement with the irs with respect to certain transactions entered into in and  whereby we agreed to make certain payments to the irs through march as a result of the settlement  we recognized an income tax benefit of million from the reduction of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities 
in july  we made a million prepayment of the initial amount due march interest expense in related to the irs settlement totaled million 
see further discussion under the heading non operating income expense income tax benefit from irs settlement 
additionally  in  we recorded net income tax benefits totaling million related to favorable adjustments and the resolution of various income tax matters 
share repurchases during  we acquired million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
as of december   we have board authoriza 
table of contents tion for approximately million of additional repurchases 
our revolving credit facilities and the indenture for our senior unsecured notes contain restrictions on our ability to make share repurchases 
see further discussion under the heading financial condition 
accounting for manufacturer allowances as of january   we adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
the adoption of eitf resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change totaling million after tax to reflect the deferral of certain allowances  primarily floorplan assistance  into inventory cost 
see further discussion under the heading new accounting pronouncements 
real estate impairment in  we recognized a million pre tax real estate impairment charge related to three underperforming franchised new vehicle stores that currently operate in converted used vehicle megastores 
see further discussion under the heading other losses gains 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual outcomes could differ from those estimates 
set forth below are the policies that we have identified as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations or that involve significant estimates 
for detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
intangible and long lived assets our policies related to intangible assets determine the valuation of intangible and long lived assets  which is a significant component of our consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  these policies affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur 
intangible assets consist primarily of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired  using the purchase method of accounting 
acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
our principal identifiable intangible assets are rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers 
we generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future  and  when the agreements do not have indefinite terms  anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost 
we believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for the foreseeable future and have indefinite lives 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually at june or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the related underlying business 
we estimate the depreciable lives of our property  plant and equipment and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if  based on market conditions  the values of these assets should be adjusted 
although we believe our property  plant and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued  the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is from the sales of new and used vehicles and commissions from related finance and insurance products 
we recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided 
we recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed  the vehicle has been delivered and payment has been received or financing 
table of contents has been arranged 
revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for i loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and ii vehicle protection products sold 
an estimated liability for chargebacks against revenue recognized from sales of finance and vehicle protection products is established during the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
we may also participate in future underwriting profit  pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  that would be recognized over the life of the policies 
rebates  holdbacks  floorplan assistance and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as offsets to the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program  whichever is later 
in the future  should changes in conditions cause us to determine that these criteria have not been met  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
other additionally  significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements including allowances for doubtful accounts  used vehicles and parts inventory valuations reserves  reserves for self insurance programs  reserves for legal proceedings  and reserves for estimated tax liabilities

the average increase in revenue per unit was attributable to a shift in mix to more expensive trucks and luxury vehicles 
the decrease in volume is primarily due to lower consumer demand in certain markets in which we operate and for certain brands sold by us 
in  although we continued to benefit from high levels of manufacturer consumer incentive programs introduced during the fourth quarter of  we experienced volume decreases consistent with industry declines of retail unit sales 
we experienced downward pressure on our new vehicle gross profit margins during  which we believe was largely due to manufacturers excess production capacity and intense competition in the industry 
while we anticipate that the new vehicle market will remain intensely competitive in and that manufacturers will look to reduce incentives offered to consumers  we expect that an improving economic environment will stabilize both new vehicle volumes and margins 
however  the level of retail sales and gross profit for is very difficult to predict 
gross profit in decreased compared to primarily due to same store sales declines partially offset by the impact of acquisitions 
same store sales in decreased in large part due to volume decreases as well as slight margin compression

wholesale revenue decreased in compared to as a result of fewer trade ins due to decreased new vehicle volume and improved management of our used vehicle inventory 
the revenue per vehicle retailed decrease reflects lower prices as a function of our shift in inventory to lower cost units  which is part of our used vehicle market strategy due to the highly competitive new vehicle market 
the decrease in used vehicle revenue in compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in volume  which was in large part caused by continued strong manufacturer incentives and zero percent financing for new vehicles as well as a more restrictive financing environment for used vehicles 
the decrease in used vehicle revenue was also caused by a decrease in the number of units wholesaled in due to an overall decline in new and used vehicle sales 
used vehicle total gross profit increased slightly in primarily due to increased wholesale gross profit 
used vehicle gross profit related to wholesale was positively impacted by our used vehicle market strategy resulting in fewer vehicles being wholesaled 
in  we are continuing to focus on comprehensive training of used vehicle personnel as well as implementing across all of our stores a web based used vehicle inventory tool that enables our stores within each of our markets to communicate with each other to optimize their used vehicle inventory supply  mix and pricing 
the decrease in used vehicle gross profit in compared to was the result of pricing pressures from manufacturer new vehicle incentives and an oversupply of used vehicles in the marketplace

total parts and service revenue and gross profit remained relatively flat in compared to this was driven by improved pricing on customer paid work offset by decreases in warranty repair orders  wholesale parts and our collision repair business 
significant decreases in domestic warranty repair orders offset import and luxury increases realized in in  we will remain focused on improving customer pay revenue and gross profit through initiatives that include implementing a standardized service process  optimizing our pricing for commonly performed vehicle services and repairs for like brand vehicles within each of our markets and using our standardized marketing communications with our customers

these matters are expected to be resolved within the next two years 
seasonality our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  demand for cars and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the united states where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions 
accordingly  we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters 
however  revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by other factors unrelated to season  such as automotive manufacturer incentives programs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
at december   fixed rate debt  primarily consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes  totaled million and had a fair value of million 
interest rate derivatives may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate  based upon market conditions 
interest rate risk at december  and  we had variable rate floorplan notes payable totaling billion and billion  respectively 
based on these amounts at december  and  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million and million  respectively  change to our annual floorplan interest expense 
our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to floorplan notes payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance which in some cases is based on variable interest rates 
net of floorplan assistance  at december  and  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million and million  respectively  change to our net inventory carrying costs 
at december  and  we had other variable rate debt outstanding totaling million and million  respectively 
based on the amounts outstanding at december  and  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million and million change to interest expense  respectively 
hedging risk we comply with statement of financial accounting standards nos 
  and collectively sfas pertaining to the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
sfas requires us to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value 
in accordance with sfas  we reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our balance sheet 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
all of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges 
during the year ended december   we entered into a series of interest rate hedge transactions  consisting of a combination of forward starting swaps  and cap and floor options collars with a notional value of million  designed to convert certain floating rate floorplan notes payable and mortgage notes to fixed rate debt 
we have million in notional swaps  which start in and effectively lock in a rate of  and million in notional collars that cap floating rates to a maximum rate no greater than 
all of our hedges mature over the next three years

as of december   all of our derivative contracts were determined to be highly effective  and no ineffective portion was recognized in income 
we had no outstanding derivatives at december
