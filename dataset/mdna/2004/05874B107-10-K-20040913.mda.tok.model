introduction operating under the name bally gaming and systems  we are a worldwide leader in designing  manufacturing and distributing traditional and nontraditional gaming machines  having marketed over  gaming machines during the past five years  and computerized monitoring systems for gaming facilities 
we also own and operate a dockside casino in vicksburg  mississippi  which has approximately table games and approximately gaming devices casino operations 
further information about our business units is contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the business section 
sources of revenue we recognize revenue from the following sources sales of gaming machines  operation of wide area progressive systems and lease of gaming machines  sales of computerized monitoring systems and related recurring hardware and software maintenance revenue  and from casino operations 
revenue from sales of gaming machines is generally recognized at the time products are shipped and title has passed to the customer 
games placed with customers on a trial basis are not recognized as revenue until the trial period ends and the customer accepts the games 
the company sells gaming equipment on normal credit terms generally  net and offers financing to qualified customers for periods generally between and months 
our gaming operations division earns revenues from recurring revenue sources that consist of the operation of wide area progressive jackpot systems and revenues from gaming machines placed in a casino on a daily lease or rental basis 
revenue from these sources is recognized based on the contractual terms of the participation or rental agreements and is generally based on a share of money wagered  a share of the net winnings  or on a fixed daily rental rate basis 
in fiscal year  bally gaming and systems responded to a proposal by the new york lottery to provide vlt devices at race tracks in the state of new york 
through the competitive bidding process  we were awarded approximately of the initial vlt s to be installed 
the financial model for this market requires the manufacturer to build  deploy and maintain the vlt s in return for a share of the net win from the vlt s 
the first games were installed at the saratoga race track in january  and have since been followed by installations at three additional tracks 
sdg was also a successful bidder in the new york lottery vlt market  having been awarded approximately of the units 
the successful sdg proposal was accomplished in the period before sdg was acquired by alliance  and the combined share for bally and sdg in this market is currently approximately revenue from sales of computerized monitoring systems is recognized in accordance with the aicpa s statement of position sop software revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
in accordance with the provisions of sop and eitf  the contracts for the sale of computerized monitoring units are considered to have multiple elements because they include hardware  software  installation  supervision  training  and post contract customer support 
accordingly  revenues from the sale of systems are deferred and begin to be recognized at the point when the system is deemed to be functionally operational  and the residual method is used to recognize revenue for the remaining elements as they are delivered  each having vendor specific objective evidence of relative fair values 
post contract customer support revenues are recognized over the period of the support agreement generally one year 
in accordance with industry practice  we recognize gaming revenues in our casino operations as the net win from gaming machine operations  which is the difference between coins and currency deposited into the machines and payments to customers 
components of expenses our most significant expenses are cost of sales  research and development expenses  advertising and promotional expenses and administrative expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with division unit leaders and by centralizing functions such as finance  accounting  legal  human resources and management information systems 
we also use our market presence and purchasing power to negotiate favorable rates with vendors and suppliers 
our research and development costs are driven by the development cycle for hardware which vary between a few months for minor revisions to more than a year for major design changes or for changes made by various slot manufacturers with which systems product must communicate and be physically integrated 
software development results in i periodic product releases that include new features that extend and enhance casino enterprise systems  ii periodic maintenance releases that enable casino operators to correct problems or improve the usability of the system  and iii documentation needed to install and use the system 
depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets historically have been significant factors in determining our overall profitability 
based on intangible assets currently held by us and the preliminary allocation of the aggregate purchase price of acquisitions completed during the year ended june   we expect the total amortization expense incurred will continue to increase 
basis of presentation our results include the accounts of alliance gaming corporation  and its wholly owned and partially owned  controlled subsidiaries 
overall consolidated operating results increase decrease rev rev rev vs vs dollars in millions  except earnings per share revenues gross profit income from operations income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income diluted earnings loss per share continuing operations discontinued operations net income fiscal vs fiscal revenues from continuing operations increased primarily due to the following acquisition of sdg which contributed million in revenues including million in game sale revenues  and million from its gaming operations 
decrease in bally gaming new unit sales revenues of million primarily due to weaknesses in the european markets particularly in russia  partially offset by stronger domestic unit sales 
the reduced sales in europe are due to a variety of factors including changes in certain sales executives who cover this area  and poor performance of certain product features which were more successful in domestic markets 
although we are expending significant resources to improve the product offerings in the non domestic markets  there can be no assurance that we will be able to return to historical unit sales levels in those markets 
increase in gaming systems revenue of million driven by strong growth in both hardware and software sales driven by strong sales to certain multi property operators 
given the size of the investments by casino operators in such systems  there can be no assurances that such sales to multi property operators will continue at such levels in the future 
increase in gaming operations revenue which contributed an incremental million driven by the larger installed base of recurring revenue games 
gross profit improved due to increases in higher margin system sales and gaming operations sales 
income from operations as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily as a result of higher research and development costs

other income expense and taxes increase decrease rev rev rev vs vs dollars in millions interest income interest expense minority interest refinancing charge miscellaneous  net total other income expense provision for income taxes tax rate fiscal year other expense increased to million from million in the fiscal year primarily as a result of refinancing our debt in september which resulted in a charge of million 
this charge was offset by a reduction in interest expense of million as a result of the refinancing 
our effective income tax rate in fiscal was 
in fiscal  we reversed the reserves against our net operating loss carry forwards  and recorded a one time tax benefit of million 
liquidity and capital as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition we had net working capital of approximately million excluding assets and liabilities of discontinued operations  an increase of approximately million from june   which is explained in the working capital section below 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at june   include approximately million of cash utilized in our casino operations that is held in vaults  cages or change banks 
additionally  pursuant to various state gaming regulations  we maintain certain cash accounts to ensure availability of funds to pay wide area progressive jackpot awards  which totaled approximately million at june  in addition  we purchase us treasury strip securities for the benefit of jackpot winners who elect to receive annual instalment payments 
these securities are presented as restricted long term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  and totaled million and million as of june  and  respectively 
in september  we completed a refinancing of our senior bank credit facility  which now consists of a million term loan later increased to million  and a million revolving credit facility the refinancing 
proceeds from the term loan were used to repay our existing bank term loans totaling approximately million  repay million of our senior subordinated notes and to pay transaction fees and expenses 
the new term loan has a per year mandatory principal amortization  with a year maturity and bears interest at libor plus later reduced to 
the revolving credit facility commitment decreases ratably over the year term of the commitment to a balloon and bears interest at libor plus 
the bank loan contains certain financial and operational covenants  however there are no borrowing base requirements 
as of june  we are in compliance with the covenants 
our new credit facility contains a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and certain of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other distributions  enter into certain acquisitions  repurchase equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  issue or sell equity interests of our subsidiaries  engage in mergers or consolidations  or engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates and otherwise restrict corporate activities 
there can be no assurance that such restrictions will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 
in addition  the bank credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with such ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the bank credit facility 
in the event of any such default  the lenders under the credit facility could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facility  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay such borrowings 
if we were unable to repay any such borrowings when due  the lenders could proceed against our collateral 
if the indebtedness under the bank credit facility were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
our obligation to make principal and interest payments on outstanding indebtedness  and to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing borrowings under the bank credit facility  will have several important effects on our future operations including the following i the portion of our cash flow from operations which will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness will not be available for other purposes  ii the bank facility borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates  iii we may be more vulnerable to downturns in our business or in the general economy and may be restricted from making acquisitions  introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities  and iv our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate or other purposes may be impaired 
additionally  our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total debt will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic and regulatory conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operation  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result of the sale of ucmc and rail city  the terms of the bank loan agreement requires us to use approximately of the net proceeds as defined in the agreement to reduce the term loan and revolver principal balances on a pro rata basis 
see also contingent commitments section 
cash flows from operating activities are derived from the cash receipts from the sale of goods and services  from the operation of wide area progressive systems  lease payments and monthly cash receipts from maintenance agreements for our casino systems customers 
in addition  we generate cash through our casino operations 
we utilize our cash to acquire materials for the manufacture of goods for resale or lease  payroll and all other selling  general and administrative expenses 
management believes that cash flows from operating activities  cash and cash equivalents held and the availability of the revolving credit facility commitment will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity 
at june   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures

an increase in inventory due to a larger backlog of participation units 
a decrease in deferred tax assets due primarily to the sale of our nevada route operations and rail city 
the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations between the dollar and the euro dollar on all working capital categories 
cash received upon sale of the nevada route  rail city and bally wulff 
cash flow during the year ended june   we generated million of cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations  compared to million in the prior year 
this increase in cash flow was driven by the increased revenue  gross margins  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities in  offset by the increase in accounts receivable and inventory 
during the year ended june   cash flow used in investing activities totaled million due to the following cash provided from the sale of the nevada route operations of million  rail city of million and bally wulff of million 
cash used in acquisitions as follows see note to the consolidated financial statements for assets and liabilities assumed in the acquisitions sdg totaled million mindplay totaled million crown totaled million capital expenditures of million costs incurred to produce participation games totaling million additions to other long term assets of million during the year ended june   million cash was provided by financing activities of continuing operations resulting from a million increase in term loans and million of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and million of cash provided from the exercise of stock options  offset by the million payoff of debt from refinancing  million of refinancing costs and million of premium paid on the early redemption of the subordinated notes and principal payments on long term debt totaling million 
customer financing management believes that customer financing terms and leasing have become an increasingly important competitive factor for the bally gaming and systems business units 
competitive conditions sometimes require bally gaming and systems to grant extended payment terms on gaming machines  systems and other gaming equipment  especially for sales in emerging markets 
while these financings are normally collateralized by such equipment  the resale value of the collateral in the event of default may be less than the amount financed 
accordingly  we have greater exposure to the financial condition of our customers in emerging markets than had historically been the case in established markets like nevada and atlantic city 
euro currency conversion our european subsidiaries use the euro as its functional currency 
the euro currency replaced the primarily all other european currencies after a phase in period  which began january  and was fully adopted in january results of operations the following table reconciles our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and refinance charge ebitda to our consolidated net income from continuing operations in s years ended june  net income from continuing operations income tax expense benefit other expense interest expense  net refinancing charge operating income depreciation and amortization ebitda from continuing operations the following tables reconcile operating income by business segment to ebitda for the year ended june  in s operating income loss depreciation and amortization ebitda bally gaming and systems casino operations corporate expenses for the year ended june  in s operating income loss depreciation and amortization ebitda bally gaming and systems casino operations corporate expenses for the year ended june  in s operating income loss depreciation and amortization ebitda bally gaming and systems casino operations corporate expenses the following table reconciles our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to our consolidated net income loss from our discontinued operations in s years ended june  net income loss from discontinued operations income tax expense benefit other expense gain on sale interest income expense  net operating income loss depreciation and amortization ebitda from discontinued operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  depreciation and amortization for these discontinued operations ceased as of july  as a result of their designation as assets held for sale 
for the year ended june  in s operating income loss depreciation and amortization ebitda route operations rail city casino for the year ended june  in s operating income loss depreciation and amortization ebitda wall machines and amusement games route operations rail city casino asset impairment charges during the year ended june   we recorded a charge of million to write down the assets of bally wulff to the sales price 
for the year ended june  in s operating income loss depreciation and amortization ebitda wall machines and amusement games route operations rail city casino asset impairment charges during the year ended june  we recorded a charge of million to write down the goodwill and other long lived assets of bally wulff 
we believe that the analysis of ebitda is a useful adjunct to operating income  net income  cash flows and other gaap based measures 
however  ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to net income loss or cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda is a common measure of performance in the gaming industry but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we disclose ebitda primarily because it is a performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of our business units and is one of several performance measures used in our management incentive plan 
additionally  ebitda is utilized as a performance measure in covenants for our bank credit agreement

depreciation expense increased for the year to date period due to increases in technology capital expenditures 
interest expense net of interest income decreased for the year to date period due to lower interest rates on our libor based bank credit facility 
income tax expense benefit decreased largely due to management conducts periodic recoverability assessments of these deferred tax assets  which includes evaluating both positive and negative evidential matter to determine if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realizable 
on june   management conducted a recoverability assessment and determined that million in previously reserved deferred tax assets were realizable due to our profitable operating results in and and projected future taxable income 
until the fourth quarter of fiscal year  management did not believe sufficient evidence existed that it was more likely than not that such profitable operating results would allow such deferred tax assets to be realized 
beginning july   the company began recognizing federal income tax expense based on of pre tax domestic income and state income taxes at a rate of approximately of domestic income 
for the twelve months ended june   the domestic earnings were offset against net operating loss carry forwards resulting in no federal income tax expense

the revolver commitment of million remains unaffected 
the exact amount of the debt repayment is subject to final adjustment in december  however in august the company made an estimated term loan pay down of million  and used additional excess cash to reduce the balance of the revolver from million to zero 
these debt paydowns are not reflected in the table above 
b on march  we completed the acquisition of sdg  the details of the purchase are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the purchase agreement additional contingent consideration of up to million may become payable in equal portions of cash and stock over the next three fiscal years upon the sdg business achieving certain significant revenue and ebitda targets 
since the timing of such payments if any  are not known  they are not reflected in the table shown above 
c pursuant to the mindplay purchase agreement  the company is obligated to make certain earn out payments to the former principals of mindplay llc 
the company is required to make guaranteed earn out payments of at least  over the first two year period of the agreement 
d except in certain rare instances  bally gaming and systems is not required by its suppliers to enter into quarterly commitments for products 
e the company has employment agreements with most of its employees with positions of vice president or above 
these agreements generally provide for an initial rate of pay and the terms of the severance benefits generally range from three to twelve months salary continuation with similar non compete periods 
almost all such agreements contain language that the employee is still an at will employee  and as such can be terminated at anytime subject to the individual termination provisions 
the only multi year arrangement is with richard haddrill  our ceo effective october   which covers a three year term  with a base salary of  only mr 
haddrill s compensation is reflected in the table above 
f pursuant to an original agreement entered into in between the company and kirkland investment corporation kirkland  owned by joel kirschbaum who is a director of alliance  and therefore treated as a related party  kirkland provides the company with certain consulting services 
pursuant to a new advisory agreement dated july   the company agreed to pay kirkland  annually for a period of years for consulting services 
in addition to the items discussed above  we have cash obligations for interest payments on our debt and for income taxes 
our long term debt is virtually all floating rate  and therefore future interest payments will be impacted by future libor rate changes as well as the balance of debt outstanding in those future periods 
interest payments for fiscal year totaled million 
we have made no significant income tax payments during the last three years as we utilized our net operating loss carry forwards  which have now been reduced almost completely as of june  we expect to begin making quarterly federal income tax payments beginning on september  the amount of such future income tax payments is dependent on the levels of our future taxable income 
the payment obligations in the above table are based on the contractually scheduled due dates 
the only payment acceleration that could be demanded of us would generally be in the event of a default under the bank credit agreement that was not cured within the provisions set forth in that agreement 
pursuant to our bank credit agreement  in certain circumstances we can enter into guarantee agreements on behalf of customers to third party creditors 
the total of such guarantees currently outstanding is less than million as of june  critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
certain of our accounting policies  including valuations utilized in asset impairment tests  acquisitions accounting  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized costs  reserves for inventory  and deferred tax reserves require that we apply significant judgement in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgements are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
there can be no assurance that the actual results will not differ from our estimates 
additional information regarding our significant accounting policies is presented below 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost elements included for work in process and finished goods include raw materials  freight  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
given the size of the account balance  and the subjective nature of market values  management has determined that inventories represent critical accounting policies 
accordingly we regularly review inventory quantities and quality and record charges for both obsolete product and for product that may have become impaired for a variety of reasons  including changes in technology  product demand  etc 
additional valuation charges could result in the future as a result of these factors 
property  plant and equipment and leased gaming equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives or lease terms  if less  using the straight line method 
leased gaming equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from years 
significant replacements and improvements are capitalized  other maintenance and repairs are expensed 
the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income as appropriate 
given the size of the account balances  the changes in technology  customer preferences and competitive products offered by other suppliers  we regularly review and evaluate the recoverability of our investment in such assets  as well as the estimated useful lives used to depreciate these assets 
there is the potential for acceleration of future depreciation  or even an asset write down  if such factors were determined to have an adverse impact on our ability to realize our full investment in such assets 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of deferred issuance costs for financings which are amortized over the life of the related financing  and acquisition related software and trademarks  which are amortized over years  and goodwill which is not amortized 
significant judgement is used in the estimation of future cash flows of such assets and in determining their estimated useful lives 
we regularly review and evaluate the recoverability of such intangible assets  many of which were acquired in our various business acquisitions 
some of the intangibles represent products that have been deployed ie sdg s central determination games and others that are just now being deployed ie mindplay s table game technology 
the success or failure of such products and their ability to generate future cash flows will have a significant impact on the timing of amortization expense and or write downs in those future periods 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets and goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used are measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  undiscounted and without interest and such estimations involve significant judgements 
if such assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of gaming machines is generally recognized at the time products are shipped and title has passed to the customer 
games placed with customers on a trial basis are not recognized as revenue until the trial period ends and the customer accepts the games 
the company sells gaming equipment on normal credit terms generally  net and offers financing to qualified customers for periods generally between and months 
game sales to large  multi property operators  are generally made pursuant to corporate agreements which contain standard sales terms and conditions and therefore generally do not involve significant judgments or estimates in recognizing revenue 
sales to smaller operators are generally made in accordance with individual sales orders with terms and conditions that are negotiated with the customer  and therefore require additional review to ensure that revenue is recorded in the proper period 
specific attention is paid to shipping terms ie fob las vegas or destination  discounting  and payment terms and conditions  and can require a significant level of review by management 
the failure to meet all of the revenue recognition conditions pursuant to the accounting standards would result in deferral of revenue to a future accounting period until all such conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
revenue from sales of computerized monitoring systems is recognized in accordance with the aicpa s statement of position sop software revenue recognition 
in accordance with the provisions of sop  the contracts for the sales of computerized monitoring units are considered to have multiple elements because they include hardware  software  installation  supervision  training  and post contract customer support 
accordingly  revenues from the sale of systems are deferred and begin to be recognized at the point when the system is deemed to be functionally operational  and the residual method is used to recognize revenue for the remaining elements as they are delivered  each having vendor specific objective evidence of relative fair values 
post contract customer support revenues are recognized over the period of the support agreement generally one year 
revenue recognition for systems sales often involve both judgements and estimates  and accordingly such transactions are subjected to additional levels of internal review each reporting period 
failure to meet all of the revenue recognition criteria in a reporting period could result in a deferral of revenue to a future period 
allowances for collection and other losses allowances for losses are maintained at levels determined by the company s management to adequately provide for collection losses and any other than temporary declines in other asset values 
in determining estimated losses  the company s management considers economic conditions  the activity in gaming markets  the financial condition of customers  changes in technology and other factors which management believes are relevant 
if a loss is indicated  the loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated net realizable value of the asset 
asset charge offs are recorded upon the disposition of the underlying assets 
management reviews the company s assets on a quarterly basis to determine the adequacy of the allowances for losses 
capitalized costs during fiscal year  bally gaming and systems has experienced an almost four fold increase in the volume of product submissions to the various domestic regulatory bodies  each of which charges fees for the testing and approval of each product 
product testing costs are capitalized once technological feasibility has been established and are amortized  generally over a three year period once the product is placed in service 
product testing costs related to projects that are discontinued are expensed when such determination is made 
the year to date fees incurred for such regulatory approvals totaled approximately million 
of these amounts incurred  the company capitalized a total of million that was directly attributable to products 
given the subjective nature of such capitalized costs  we have instituted a strict review process which includes a full review of the costs incurred and the nature and prospects of the related product 
after costs are capitalized  they are monitored to ensure that they are earning revenues through product sales 
future write offs are possible if such products do not produce adequate cash flows 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
taxes on income of the company s foreign subsidiaries are provided at the tax rates applicable to the tax jurisdictions in which they are located 
the accounting for income taxes involves significant judgements and estimates and deals with complex tax regulations 
the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets is based in part on estimates of future income and the timing of temporary differences  and the failure to fully realize such deferred tax assets could result in a higher tax provision in future periods 
risk factors competition bally gaming and systems 
the market for gaming machines is extremely competitive  and there are a number of established  well financed and well known companies producing machines that compete with each of the bally gaming and systems product lines in each of the bally gaming and systems markets 
the domestic market for gaming machines is dominated by a single competitor  international game technology igt  with a number of smaller competitors in the field 
in addition  certain technology oriented companies have recently entered or may enter the gaming machine market 
management believes that some of these competitors have greater capital resources than we do 
competition among gaming machine manufacturers  particularly with respect to sales of gaming machines to new and emerging markets  is based on competitive customer pricing and financing terms  appeal to the player  product quality  and having an extensive distribution and sales network 
sales to established casinos in nevada normally require completion of a successful trial period for the machines in the casino 
the competition for casino enterprise systems currently consists of igt  aristocrat  acres gaming  inc  mis  and  to a lesser extent  konami and mikohn gaming corporation 
competition is keen in this market due to the number of providers and the limited number of casinos and the jurisdictions in which they operate 
pricing  product feature and function  accuracy  and reliability are all main factors in determining a provider s success in selling its system 
bally gaming and systems believes the future success of our operations will be determined by our ability to bring new and innovative products to the marketplace while at the same time maintaining the base of loyal existing customers 
casino operations 
the operation of casinos is also a highly competitive business 
the principal competitive factors in the industry include the quality and location of the facility  the nature and quality of the amenities and customer services offered and the implementation and success of marketing programs 
our rainbow casino in vicksburg  mississippi faces intense direct competition from other gaming facilities serving the vicksburg market 
competition from casinos in nearby locations may also be reducing the market from which vicksburg casinos draw most of their patrons 
moreover  additional potential gaming sites remain in and around vicksburg  some of these sites may be closer to larger population centers and  if developed  might enjoy a competitive advantage over our casinos 
route operations discontinued operations 
in louisiana  our route operations at the racetrack and otbs compete with various truck stops and locations with liquor licenses throughout the new orleans area  as well as riverboat gaming and one land based casino 
product development our future success depends to a large extent upon our ability to design  manufacture and market technologically sophisticated and entertaining products that achieve high levels of player acceptance 
the development of a successful new product or product design by a competitor could adversely affect sales of our products and force us to attempt to respond quickly with our own competing products 
response speed is lower in jurisdictions requiring product approvals prior to commercialization 
our plan with respect to the introduction of more sophisticated technology into the electronic gaming machine market is designed to lead to an increase in market share and profitability for us 
however  there is no assurance that any such products will be developed  or that if developed they will receive necessary regulatory approvals or be commercially successful 
although we are developing a number of new products  there can be no guarantee of commercial acceptance of any of our products 
the gaming industry is employing new technology in many new areas  and we and our competitors continue to file for patents protecting such technologies 
although we are not aware of any patent violations  there can be no assurances that patents currently pending will not be determined to have infringed upon an existing patent held by a third party 
bally gaming and systems continues to deploy new products that are placed in casinos and earn recurring revenues and cash flows 
the amount of revenues earned is dependent on the earning power of the game 
the games will likely have a shorter life than more traditional games  and we will have to continue to design and deploy successful games to maintain this stream of revenue 
there can be no assurance that the games recently deployed will be successful or that we will be able to design and deploy new recurring revenue games 
intellectual property litigation we may incur significant litigation expenses protecting our intellectual property or defending our use of intellectual property  which may have an adverse effect on our future cash flow and results of operations 
competitors and other third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights or may allege that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights  resulting in significant litigation expenses  which would reduce our cash flow 
sales to non traditional gaming markets the continued growth of the non traditional markets outside of nevada and atlantic city for electronic gaming machines is contingent on the public s acceptance of these markets and an ongoing regulatory approval process by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
we cannot predict which new jurisdictions or markets  if any  will approve the operation of electronic gaming machines  the timing of any such approval or the level of our participation in any such markets  or whether jurisdictions currently permitting gaming will continue to do so in the future 
customer financing management believes that customer financing terms and leasing have become increasingly important competitive factors for bally gaming and systems 
competitive conditions sometimes require bally gaming and systems to grant extended payment terms on gaming machines  systems and other gaming equipment  especially for sales in emerging markets 
while such equipment normally collateralizes these financings  the resale value of the collateral in the event of default may be less than the amount financed 
accordingly  we have greater exposure to the financial condition of our customers in emerging markets than had historically been the case in established markets like nevada and atlantic city 
foreign operations our business in foreign markets is subject to the risks customarily associated with such activities 
these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls  expropriation  nationalization and other economic  tax and regulatory policies of local governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 
as of june   bally gaming and systems has million of receivables from customers in countries outside of the united states most of which are denominated in us dollars 
we do not generally enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
ability to service debt  liquidity as of june   the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our debt outstanding totaled million 
upon the completion of the refinancing in september  we replaced our existing bank debt and senior subordinated notes with approximately million of term loans  and million drawn on the revolving credit facility 
during the december quarter the company increased the term loan by million  to a total of million outstanding 
the proceeds were used primarily to fund the acquisition sdg 
as a result the company incurred an additional million in debt issuance costs  which have been capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining term of the loan 
as a result of the sale of ucmc and rail city  the terms of the bank loan agreement requires the use approximately of the net proceeds as defined in the agreement to reduce the term loan and revolver principal balances on a pro rata basis 
the revolver commitment of million remains unaffected 
the exact amount of the debt repayment is subject to final adjustment in december  however in august the company made an estimated term loan pay down of million  and used additional excess cash to reduce the balance of the revolver from million to zero 
our new credit facility contains a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and certain of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other distributions  enter into certain acquisitions  repurchase equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  issue or sell equity interests of our subsidiaries  engage in mergers or consolidations  or engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates and otherwise restrict corporate activities 
there can be no assurance that such restrictions will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 
in addition  the bank credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with such ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the bank credit facility 
in the event of any such default  the lenders under the credit facility could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facility  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay such borrowings 
if we were unable to repay any such borrowings when due  the lenders could proceed against our collateral 
if the indebtedness under the bank credit facility were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
our obligation to make principal and interest payments on outstanding indebtedness  and to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing borrowings under the bank credit facility  will have several important effects on our future operations including the following i the portion of our cash flow from operations which will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness will not be available for other purposes  ii the bank facility borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates  iii we may be more vulnerable to downturns in our business or in the general economy and may be restricted from making acquisitions  introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities  and iv our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate or other purposes may be impaired 
additionally  our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total debt will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic and regulatory conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operation  many of which are beyond our control 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate the cash flow necessary to permit us to meet our fixed charges and repayment obligations 
any inability of us to service our fixed charges and repayment obligations would have a significant adverse effect on us 
dependence on key personnel our success will be dependent  to a significant extent  on the continued services of a relatively small group of executive personnel 
the loss or unavailability of one or more of such executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have an adverse effect on our operations 
on july  the company announced that richard haddrill has been appointed president and chief executive officer effective october  mr 
haddrill succeeds robert miodunski who will remain ceo until september   and will serve thereafter as a consultant to the board of directors 
the company has also formed of the office of the chairman to oversee seamless transition and management succession 
the office of the chairman consists of board members david robbins and joel kirschbaum  mr 
haddrill  and mr 
miodunski 
strict regulation by gaming authorities the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines and the conduct of gaming operations are subject to extensive federal  state  local  and foreign regulation by various gaming authorities each  a gaming authority 
although the laws and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate vary in their technical requirements and are subject to amendment from time to time  virtually all these jurisdictions require licenses  permits  documentation of the qualification  including evidence of integrity and financial stability  and other forms of approval for companies engaged in gaming operations and the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines as well as for the officers  directors  major stockholders  and key personnel of such companies 
the company and our key personnel have obtained  or applied for  all government licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits and approvals necessary for the manufacture and distribution  and operation where permitted  of its gaming machines in the jurisdictions in which it currently does business 
however  there can be no assurance those licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits  or approvals will be given or renewed in the future or that we will obtain the licenses necessary to operate in emerging markets 
additionally  there can be no assurance that any regulatory agency will not enact new rules or change regulations that would negatively impact our ability to operate or our financial results 
gaming taxes gaming operators are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to corporate and state income taxes  and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time 
any material increase in these taxes or fees  which could occur prospectively or retroactively  would adversely affect us 
we pay and expect to continue to pay taxes and fees in nevada  and new jersey 
the new jersey legislature enacted in an eight percent tax on the proceeds we receive from the operation of wide area progressive slot machines in atlantic city casinos 
we expect to pay substantial taxes and fees in any other jurisdiction in which we conduct gaming operations 
there can be no assurance as to future changes in taxation on gaming operations 
currency rate fluctuations we derive revenues from our non us subsidiaries  all of which revenues are denominated in their local currencies  and their results are affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies and the non us dollar 
most of the currencies in countries in which we have foreign operations strengthened versus the us dollar in and  which resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars 
we do not currently utilize hedging instruments 
market risks during the normal course of our business  we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest and currency rate movements  collectibility of accounts and notes receivable  and recoverability of residual values on leased assets 
we constantly assess these risks and have established policies and practices designed to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurances can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis of our financial instruments  which consist of our cash and cash equivalents and debt 
we have no derivative financial instruments 
in performing the sensitivity analysis  we define risk of loss as the hypothetical impact on earnings  of changes in the market interest rates or currency exchange rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis at june   are as follows interest rate risk we had total debt of approximately million  consisting primarily of the new million term loan and the initial million borrowing on the revolver and other debt at approximately million 
the bank facility loans are broken into individual loans with varying terms from one to six months 
the interest rate for each loan is set on the borrowing date and is effective for the term outstanding 
if the libor rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  with all other factors remaining constant  earnings would decrease or increase by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our foreign subsidiaries generally use their domestic currency as their functional currency 
a fluctuation in the exchange rates of these currencies against the us dollar would result in a corresponding change in earnings reported in the consolidated group of approximately million 
estimates our financial statements are prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates either favorably or unfavorably  which may impact future results
