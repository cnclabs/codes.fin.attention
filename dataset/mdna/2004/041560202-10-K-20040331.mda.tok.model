executive overview we are engaged primarily in developing  selling  owning  operating and managing limited service hotels  without food and beverage facilities  primarily amerihost inn hotels 
our hotels are concentrated primarily in the midwestern and south central united states  however we have developed a number of hotel properties in california and the south central us over the past several years

hotel and corporate level financing our company owned and operated hotels have been financed historically through either a combination of debt and equity  or lease financing 
our lenders are typically local or regional banks  or other financial institutions  that provide mortgage debt based on a percentage of cost or value  as determined by each individual lender 
the loan to value ratios have typically ranged from 
the equity requirement has been funded through our operating cash flow or other corporate financing resources  such as our operating line of credit with lasalle bank na 
our joint ventures have also historically been financed through a combination of debt and equity  similar to the terms discussed above  and in one case  through a long term lease 
we have also typically made an equity contribution of up to of the total equity as a minority partner 
in addition  we have guaranteed the mortgage debt of the joint venture in most instances 
we paid off approximately million in mortgage debt in  in connection with the sale of hotels 
we expect to decrease our mortgage debt further as we sell additional hotels 
total debt service for  excluding mortgages which mature in  is approximately million for all of our consolidated hotels 
total debt service for our unconsolidated joint ventures in  excluding mortgages which mature in  is approximately million 
however  if certain anticipated hotel sales occur  these obligations would decrease as the related mortgage debt would be paid off with the proceeds therefrom 
in and  our subsidiary completed a sale and lease back transaction with pmc a reit for amerihost inn hotels 
since then  pmc has sold  or we have repurchased  nine hotels  leaving hotels currently leased from pmc 
the leases expire in  subject to an automatic five year extension by either our subsidiary or pmc  plus additional renewals through our subsidiary s current lease obligation for these hotels is approximately million on an annual basis 
we have guaranteed our subsidiary s obligation under the leases 
at the corporate level  our sole financing source is our operating line of credit with lasalle bank na 
this line of credit is a revolving facility  allowing us to take advances when needed  up to the allowed maximum  and to repay any advances without penalty 
this facility also requires us to satisfy financial covenants such as minimum net worth  maximum debt to net worth  minimum net income  and minimum debt service ratio 
our current maximum availability under the line of credit is million  subject to adjustments discussed below 
overall industry and economic factors the lodging industry s performance  and the related travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers  generally follows the trends of the overall us economy 
both the us economy and the lodging industry began to decline in the performances of our hotels have followed this same trend 
as the us economy began to show signs of improvement in  the lodging industry has followed in the latter part of however  historically we have seen that lodging demand trends will typically lag six to nine months behind these economic trends 
based on the economic forecasts such as the gdp growth forecast  our industry outlook for is optimistic 
the downturn in the lodging industry has also negatively impacted the values of hotel assets 
in an environment with declining revenues and margins  the prices at which hotels are sold have generally been relatively lower than prior to the economic downturn 
fluctuations in values could have a material impact on our plan to sell a significant number of hotels on an accelerated basis in and  and the net cash proceeds that we receive 
key business trends and developments we have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business 
these indicators include room revenue per available room  or revpar  and revpar penetration index 
revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include revenues from telephone and other guest services generated by the property 
revpar is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels  and we use revpar to compare the results of our hotels between periods and to compare results of our comparable hotels 
the table below shows our same room amerihost inn hotel revpar results versus the mid scale without food and beverage segment of the limited service hotel industry over the past eight years 
consistent with overall lodging industry performance  our amerihost inn revpar results have ranged from a increase in  to a decrease in although our amerihost inn hotels did not outperform their segment in and  they have outperformed their industry segment s performance in six of the last eight years 
revpar growth amerihost inn hotels limited service segment  without food and beverage includes all amerihost inn hotels we owned and operated  including unconsolidated minority owned hotels  operating for at least full months during the periods presented 
according to smith travel research  a leading industry analyst 
a related revenue measure for our hotels is the revpar penetration index 
the revpar penetration index reflects each property s revpar in relation to the revpar for that property s competitive set 
we use the measure as an indicator of a property s market share 
for example  a revpar penetration index of would indicate that a hotel s revpar is  on average  the same as its competitors 
a revpar penetration index exceeding would indicate that a hotel maintains a revpar premium in relation to its competitive set  while a revpar penetration index below would be an indicator that a hotel is underperforming its competitive set 
one critical component in this calculation is the determination of a hotel s competitive set 
factors that we consider include geographic proximity  as well as the level of service provided at the property 
our methodology for determining a hotel s competitive set  however  may differ for those used by other owners and or managers 
from a market penetration standpoint  in the aggregate  our amerihost inn hotels were at an index of for we believe that many factors contribute to our amerihost inn hotels which underperform their competitive set with regard to revpar penetration  including the relatively smaller size of the amerihost inn brand compared to many other hotel brands with significant critical mass and market penetration  a lower contribution rate from the amerihost inn reservation system compared to many other hotel brands  and the level of new competition in the local markets which compete directly with our hotels 
despite some positive trends with regard to same room revenue  the cash flow from the operations of many of our hotels in  was not sufficient to pay their related mortgage debt service  lease obligations  and ongoing capital expenditures 
our operating margins declined significantly in as many expenses increased substantially  including employee wages and benefits  insurance  maintenance  utilities  and property taxes 
we have a significant amount of debt and obligations under long term leases  such as the leases with pmc  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from our overall operations  including our business activities other than hotel operations  to make these required payments 
while we believe the combination of improved demand for hotel rooms and our cost control initiatives create the possibility of improvements in our hotel operations in  there can be no assurance that any increases in hotel revenues  or improvement in earnings will be achieved 
the trends discussed above may not occur for any number of reasons  including slower than anticipated growth in the economy  changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers and the continued threat of terrorist attacks  all of which may result in lower revenues or higher operating costs and declining operating margins 
lasalle bank na  the lender for our corporate line of credit has decreased the availability under this facility over the past two years  from million to the current maximum of million 
we have recently executed a commitment from lasalle bank to renew this facility through april  the revised terms require that the maximum availability under the facility be reduced to million on june   further reduced to million on august   and further reduced to million on february  furthermore  the majority of the proceeds from the sale of any hotel properties must be used to reduce the outstanding balance of the line of credit until it is at or below million  at which time the maximum availability on the line will be reduced to million  even if prior to the august   scheduled reduction date 
the renewed facility will bear interest at the rate of per annum 
our million new construction loan facility expired october  without renewal 
we are seeking a renewal of this facility  however we do not know when  or if  the lender will approve this or any similar facility 
we used this facility to finance the combined construction and long term mortgage debt required for many of our wholly owned new construction amerihost inn hotel projects during the past few years 
mortgage financing is a critical component of the hotel development process and we intend to seek additional financing sources 
if we  or the hotel joint ventures in which we are a partner  are unable to obtain adequate mortgage financing on acceptable terms  our ability to develop new hotels will be significantly limited 
management s priorities based on our primary business objectives and anticipated operating conditions  our key priorities  and focus in and the next several years include the following divest up to of our existing hotel portfolio  which hotels in many instances have operated with cash flow that is insufficient to pay their debt service and ongoing capital expenditures during the past year  expand our hotel development activities to be developing and or acquiring and converting hotels at a pace of hotels per year by the end of we intend for this development to primarily be the new construction of larger amerihost inn hotels  or selective acquisition of existing hotels and their conversion to amerihost inn  in larger markets  primarily through joint ventures where we can earn significant development fees  with the intention of selling these hotels after a shorter holding period than we have historically  grow our relationships with existing and new joint venture partners in connection with the development of new amerihost inn hotels  improve hotel operation results through a combination of selling hotels  revenue generation initiatives  and cost control measures  increase the fees we receive from cendant  including the one time development incentive fee and the recurring royalty sharing fees  from selling of our hotels to third parties  and as a result of cendant s efforts from growing the number of amerihost inn franchises through their own sales  restructure our lease agreements with pmc  obtain longer term corporate level financing than our historical one year operating line of credit  to better match our financing sources with our business plan of developing  building and selling amerihost inn hotels  and obtain growth capital to finance both the equity and debt required for the anticipated development projects 
summary of year end results 
total revenues increased in  due primarily to increases in hotel sales and commissions and incentive and royalty sharing fees 
total revenues from consolidated amerihost inn hotels decreased from million to million during  due primarily to the sale of hotels and a decrease in same room revenue for these hotels 
revenues from the development segment decreased during  as we were developing two amerihost inn hotels for joint ventures in  versus three hotels for joint ventures in revenues from hotel sales and commissions increased during  as a result of the sale of eight amerihost inn hotels during  versus the sale of five wholly owned amerihost inn hotels in revenues from hotel management and employee leasing segments decreased during  due primarily to termination of management contracts for five hotels effective january  we received the final  installment in in connection with the sale of the amerihost inn brand names and franchising rights 
we recorded a net loss of million for  compared to a net loss of in these results include non cash hotel impairment provisions in and discontinued operations related to non amerihost inn hotels which have been recorded in connection with the implementation of the plan for hotel disposition and hotel development repositioning as discussed below 
the results for  and are summarized as follows in thousands net income loss from continuing operations  before impairment  impairment provision  net of tax  net income loss from continuing operations  discontinued operations  net of tax   net income loss   net income loss per share diluted from continuing operations from discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstance relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
consolidation policy the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which we have a majority or controlling interest 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
a joint venture project will be consolidated if we have a majority ie  greater than ownership interest  or when we have a minority ownership interest ie  less than and can exercise control over the critical decisions of the joint venture 
we will evaluate several factors in determining whether or not we have control over the joint venture to warrant consolidation 
these factors include the nature of our ownership for example  the sole general partner in a limited partnership  the sole managing member of a limited liability company  etc  oversight of the daily operations  and the ability to make major decisions such as to refinance or sell the hotel asset without the consent of the other partners  among others 
minority owned joint ventures in which we maintain a non controlling ownership interest are accounted for by the equity method 
under this method  we maintain an investment account  which is increased by contributions made and our share of the joint venture s income  and decreased by distributions received and our share of the joint venture s losses  in accordance with the terms of the joint venture agreement 
our share of each joint venture s income or loss  including gains and losses from capital transactions  is reflected on our consolidated statement of operations as equity in income and losses from unconsolidated joint ventures 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether or not it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company is required to adopt the requirements of fin r for interim periods beginning after march  this interpretation requires that the company present any variable interest entities in which it has a majority variable interest on a consolidated basis in its financial statements 
the company is continuing to assess the provisions of this interpretation and the impact to the company of adopting this interpretation 
the company currently anticipates consolidating four variable interest entities upon the application of fin r  however the company is continuing to assess the provisions of this interpretation and the impact to the company of adopting this interpretation 
therefore  the impact may change based upon this additional analysis 
the consolidation of these four joint ventures is expected to add approximately million in assets and million in liabilities to the company s consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the company had investments in  and advances to  these joint ventures of approximately million  which was presented as such under the equity method of accounting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company expects that it will continue to present all of its other unconsolidated investments under the equity method 
revenue recognition we provide hotel development  management  and staffing services to unrelated third parties and unconsolidated  minority owned joint ventures 
revenues can be generated in three ways i we will record revenue from the development and construction of the hotel  ii if we enter into a hotel management agreement with the owner  we will recognize revenue in accordance with the terms of the agreement  and iii if we enter into a hotel staffing agreement with the owner  we will recognize revenue in accordance with the terms of the agreement as services are performed 
an unrelated third party or an unconsolidated minority owned joint venture may contract with us for any or all three services 
however  we will not provide employee leasing services unless we also provide hotel management services pursuant to a written agreement 
hotel operations the revenue from the operation of a consolidated hotel is recognized as part of the hotel operations segment when earned 
typically  cash is collected from the guest at the time of check in or checkout  however we also extend credit to selected corporate customers 
the reserve for doubtful accounts is reviewed periodically for reasonableness and is considered appropriate as of december  hotel sales and commissions our intention is to operate the consolidated amerihost inn hotels until a buyer is found at an appropriate price 
we may actively try to sell the hotel during the construction period  upon opening  or anytime thereafter 
unless specifically identified as held for sale  we will depreciate the hotel assets and classify them as investment assets while we operate the hotel  since it is not assured that a sale will ultimately be consummated 
when a sale is consummated  we record the hotel sale price as revenue and the net cost basis of the hotel asset as expense  as part of our ongoing operational activity 
from time to time  pmc  a reit which owns certain of our leased hotels  has sold its hotels 
we have earned a commission from pmc for our services in facilitating these sales to third parties 
this commission is recorded as revenue when the sale is consummated 
hotel development and construction we recognize revenue from the development and construction of hotels for third parties and unconsolidated minority owned entities pursuant to development and construction contracts with the hotel ownership entity 
all contracts must be fully executed prior to the start of construction 
in addition  typically we will not begin construction on a hotel for a joint venture or third party until it is assured that both the equity and debt financing are in place 
we record the total contract price as development and construction revenue over the relevant development and construction period  and all development and construction costs as operating expenses in the hotel development segment 
development fee revenue from construction renovation projects with unaffiliated third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
however development fee revenue is not recognized until certain development hurdles are met  such as the execution of a land purchase contract and the debt and equity financing commitments 
construction fee revenue from construction renovation projects with unaffiliated third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures is recognized on the percentage of completion method  generally based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total contract costs 
revenue from contract change orders is recognized to the extent costs incurred are recoverable 
profit recognition begins when construction reaches a progress level sufficient to estimate the probable outcome 
provision is made for anticipated future losses in full at the time they are identified 
when we build a hotel for an unconsolidated joint venture  a portion of the profit is deferred and included on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred income 
the deferral is computed based on our ownership percentage in the joint venture and the construction profit as it is recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
we recognize the deferred income over the estimated useful life of the related hotel asset 
a portion of the deferral is amortized over the same life the joint venture is depreciating the hotel asset generally years  and the remaining portion is amortized over the same life the joint venture is depreciating the furniture  fixtures equipment generally years 
upon the sale of a hotel by the joint venture to an unaffiliated third party  the remaining unamortized deferred income is recognized as equity in income and loss of affiliates in our consolidated financial statements 
hotel management services we recognize management fee revenue when we perform hotel management services for unrelated third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures 
the management fees are computed based upon a percentage of total hotel revenues  ranging from to  plus incentive fees in certain instances  in accordance with the terms of the individual written management agreements 
we recognize the management fee revenue in the hotel management segment as the related hotel revenue is earned 
employee leasing we recognize employee leasing revenue when we staff hotels  and perform related services  for unrelated third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures 
employee leasing revenues are generally computed as the actual payroll costs plus an administrative fee ranging from to  in accordance with the terms of the individual written staffing agreements 
we recognize the employee leasing revenue in the employee leasing segment as the related payroll cost is incurred 
although we maintain employee leasing agreements with the hotel ownership entities  we are still ultimately responsible for its employees 
in addition  we are responsible for maintaining and determining staffing levels  scheduling  hiring  firing  performance reviews  etc 
through our managers who are our direct employees 
moreover  we are at risk with regard to personnel issues and lawsuits 
as such  we have recorded employee leasing revenues primarily as the gross payroll cost  plus the administrative fee 
incentive and royalty sharing we seek not only to generate profit from the sale of a hotel  but also to generate an additional development incentive fee and long term  ongoing royalty sharing revenues from cendant corporation 
cendant has agreed to pay us a development incentive fee every time we sell one of our existing amerihost inn hotels to a buyer who executes an amerihost inn franchise agreement with cendant 
in addition  this fee also will be paid to us for new hotels that we develop which are then sold to a franchisee of cendant 
this fee applies to the first hotels we sell during the year term of the agreement  expiring in the fee is computed based on the most recent twelve months revenue  or a stipulated per room amount if the hotel has been open less than eighteen months 
since the cendant agreement provides for the potential reimbursement of this fee  from future fees earned  in the event the buyer defaults on the franchise agreement within the first months  these fees are deferred when received  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the deferred fees are amortized as incentive and royalty sharing segment revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements on a straight line basis over the month period  as the contingencies on the revenues are removed 
cendant has agreed to pay us a portion of all royalty fees cendant receives from all of its amerihost inn franchisees through september generally  cendant receives royalty fees from each of their franchisees based upon a percentage of guest room revenue  ranging from to 
in turn  cendant will pay us a portion of this fee as stipulated in the agreement 
we include this royalty sharing fee as incentive and royalty sharing fee revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
guarantees we apply the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  with respect to mortgage loan guarantees for joint ventures in which we are a partner 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures required by the guarantor and requires the guarantor to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
during the third quarter of  we provided a guarantee related to the mortgage debt of a joint venture in which it shares the responsibility of the guarantee on a joint and several basis with its joint venture partners 
the guarantee is effective for the year term of the mortgage loan 
we have recorded an additional investment in this joint venture  and a liability for its share of this guarantee at the time of issuances  less accumulated amortization of approximately  as of december   its estimated fair value 
sale and leaseback of hotels during and  we sold hotels to pmc commercial trust  a real estate investment trust reit for approximately million 
upon the sale of the hotels  our subsidiary simultaneously entered into agreements to lease back each of the hotels from the pmc 
the leases are for an initial term of years  as amended  and provide for rent in the amount of of the original sale price  increased annually after year three by the lesser of or the cpi adjustment 
the gains from the sale of the hotels in and were deferred for financial statement reporting purposes  due to the continuing involvement with the long term lease agreement  and are being amortized on a straight line basis into income as a reduction of leasehold rent expense over the year initial term 
upon the sale of a hotel  which is owned by pmc to an unaffiliated third party  the remaining unamortized deferred income is recognized as gain on sale of fixed assets in our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently in discussions with pmc to restructure the lease agreements and provide for the sale of all the leased hotels see item business under the heading  leased hotel properties 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of certain long lived assets in relation to historical results  current business conditions and trends to identify potential situations in which the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
if such reviews indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  we would estimate the undiscounted sum of the expected cash flows of such assets to determine if such sum is less than the carrying value of such assets to ascertain if an impairment exists 
if an impairment exists  we would determine the fair value by using quoted market prices  if available for such assets  or if quoted market prices are not available  we would discount the expected future cash flows of such assets 
in july  we implemented a plan to sell approximately to hotels over the next two years 
in connection with the implementation of the plan to sell hotels  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for long lived assets  we have recorded million in pre tax  non cash impairment charges during  related to of the hotels targeted for sale 
approximately  pre tax of the non cash impairment charges relates to three consolidated non amerihost inn hotels anticipated to be sold  and has been included in discontinued operations 
the non cash impairment charge represents an adjustment to reduce the carrying value of certain hotel assets to the estimated sales prices  net of estimated costs to sell 
based on the implementation of this plan for hotel dispositions  the hotel assets identified for sale  which are being actively marketed and expected to be sold within a twelve month period  have been classified as held for sale on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  hotels identified as part of the plan of disposition  which are not currently marketed  and are not expected to be sold within the next twelve months  have not been classified as held for sale 
the debt that is expected to be paid off as a result of these hotel sales has been classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the results of the operations of business components which have been disposed of or classified as held for sale are to be reported as discontinued operations if such operations and cash flow have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  the disposition of non amerihost inn hotels have been treated as discontinued operations 
however  the disposition of amerihost inn hotels  although classified as held for sale on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  have not been treated as discontinued operations due to the ongoing royalty fees to be earned by us after their disposition 
in addition  in accordance with this literature  we have ceased depreciating the hotel assets that have been classified as held for sale 
if the company determines that a property is no longer for sale  or if a property does not sell  after a certain period of time  under certain conditions  a depreciation expense adjustment may be recorded at that time  up to the amount of depreciation that would have been recorded during the period that the asset was classified as held for sale 
during the fourth quarter of  two amerihost inn hotels previously classified as held for sale were reclassified back to operating assets since we no longer were actively marketing these properties for sale 
in accordance with sfas  depreciation was recorded through december   as if the hotels were never classified as held for sale 
we anticipate reviewing the market status of the hotels held for sale at some time later in  which assessment may result in additional depreciation adjustments if any hotels are removed from the held for sale classification 
hotel disposition plan and restructuring in and  we sold  or have facilitated the sale for joint ventures for a landlord  hotel properties 
however  during  senior management  and the board of directors  determined that the sale of a significant number of hotel properties would assist us achieving our financial and growth objectives  as well as support our liquidity 
the sale of the hotels is expected to provide liquidity for operational and ongoing capital expenditure needs  reduce outstanding debt  increase operating cash flow of the hotel operations segment  accelerate the generation and realization of development incentive and royalty sharing fees from our agreements with cendant  provide capital for future new hotel development and or acquisition and conversion of existing hotels  and provide capital to repurchase common stock 
in july  we adopted a strategic plan to sell approximately to hotel properties over a two year period 
the properties to be sold include to amerihost inns and six non amerihost hotels that are wholly or partially owned 
the decision to recommend the sale of a hotel property is made by our senior management team and approved by a majority of the board of directors or a committee thereof 
we sold hotels including six hotels as part of this disposition plan in  more than any other year in our history 
the financial impact is summarized as follows in thousands net cash number proceeds mortgage cendant of after mortgage debt incentive hotels payoff reduction fees consolidated hotels amerihost inn hotels    other brand hotels  unconsolidated hotels amerihost inn hotels total    an integral part of our growth plan  profitability  and liquidity is our ability to sell hotels  including those under the plan for disposition  as well as our other existing hotels  and hotels we develop in the future 
in addition  in connection with our asset disposition plan  we undertook certain hotel regional management  hotel development  and other corporate level restructuring actions in  including we have not replaced several corporate positions which had been vacated as a result of normal attrition during  we did not fill several positions which had been budgeted for in  and we reduced our corporate office space needs  giving us the ability to lease more space to third parties 
the restructuring including a reduction in our existing corporate and hotel regional management staff by approximately  or positions 
however  we subsequently added or enhanced five positions in the hotel development  hotel marketing revenue management  and finance areas  to assist us in expanding our hotel development activity and increasing hotel revenue  offsetting a portion of the projected savings 
we expect to incur total non recurring restructuring charges of approximately  through the second quarter of these charges reflect costs of items such as severance benefits  insurance benefits  outplacement services  legal services and office reconfiguration 
approximately  in such restructuring costs were incurred during and recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

the decrease in revenues from consolidated amerihost inn hotels was partially offset by the opening of three newly constructed amerihost inn hotels 
our hotel revenues have been impacted by general economic and industry conditions  and an increase in competition in certain markets  primarily from newly constructed hotels 
as a result  we experienced increased downward pressure on occupancy levels and average daily rates 
we believe that as the total number of amerihost inn hotels in the brand increases  the greater the benefits will be at all amerihost locations from marketplace recognition and repeat business 
in addition  we are now focused on building new hotels in larger  growing markets where many of our competitors already exist or where we factor in a certain level of additional hotel development 
hotel development revenues are directly related to the number of hotels being developed and constructed for minority owned entities or unrelated third parties  and the timing of the construction period 
we were constructing two hotels for minority owned entities during  compared to two minority owned hotels and one unrelated third party hotel during hotel sales revenue increased as a result of the sales of eight wholly owned amerihost inn hotels during  compared to the sale of four wholly owned amerihost inn hotels during in addition  we facilitated the sale of one amerihost inn hotel leased to us by pmc during the sale of the eight wholly owned amerihost inn hotels in generated net hotel revenues of approximately million compared to million in from the sale of the five hotels in  plus a commission earned on the pmc sale 
we intend to continue to build and sell amerihost inn hotels in order to generate increased fees under the agreement with cendant while enhancing our operating results and cash flow 
hotel management revenue decreased  due primarily to the termination of five management contracts with joint ventures effective january  employee leasing revenue decreased  due primarily to the reduction in rooms managed for minority owned entities and unrelated third parties as described above  and a concerted effort to decrease hotel employee payroll costs which is the basis for the employee leasing revenue 
in addition  during  we began treating our workers compensation insurance cost as a pass through cost  whereby the hotels reimburse us for the insurance cost  however it is not shown as part of our employee leasing operating cost and revenue since the revenue is based on employee leasing cost 
the workers compensation insurance cost has never been included for purposes of computing our administrative fee 
development incentive and royalty sharing revenue increased as a result of the sale of additional amerihost inn hotels and the increase in the number of non company owned amerihost inn hotels franchised with cendant 
we received approximately  and  during and  respectively  in development incentive fees from the sale of amerihost inn hotels 
approximately  and  was recognized during and  respectively  from the amortization of this deferred income 
we also recorded approximately  and  in royalty sharing revenue during and  respectively 
office building rental consisting of leasing activities from our office building  increased due to the annual increases as stipulated in the various lease agreements with the tenants  and the leasing of additional office space during versus we occupy approximately of the rentable square feet  as reduced as part of the restructuring activities discussed in part above 
approximately of the space is leased to unrelated third parties pursuant to long term lease agreements  and we have hired a national real estate broker to assist us in leasing the rest of the available space 
operating costs and expenses 
total operating costs and expenses increased  primarily due to an increase in operating costs and expenses from the greater number of hotel sales  and the higher aggregate net book value of these hotels upon their sale  as described below 
a decrease in operating costs in the hotel operations segment was due primarily to the fewer number of hotels included in this segment hotels at december   as compared to hotels at december  operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues for the consolidated amerihost inn hotels increased due primarily to the costs of insurance  real estate taxes  energy  general and administrative  and ongoing maintenance and secondarily due to several hotels operating during their initial stabilization period when revenues are typically lower and significant start up costs are incurred 
operating costs and expenses for the hotel development segment decreased  consistent with the decrease in hotel development activity for  compared to operating costs and expenses in the hotel development segment as a percentage of segment revenue increased during due to the greater level of projects from third parties and joint ventures  in the construction phase of the total development process in  which construction phase activity has a higher ratio of operating costs to revenues  compared to the ratio of operating costs to revenues during the pre construction  development phase 
hotel management segment operating costs and expenses decreased primarily due to the decrease in the number of hotel rooms operated and managed for unrelated third parties and minority owned entities 
employee leasing operating costs and expenses decreased during  compared to  consistent with the decrease in segment revenue for as noted above 
office building rental operating costs and expenses consisted primarily of expenses related to the management of our office building 
the increase in operating expenses from to was due primarily to a change in the allocation of certain of the office building costs among the other operating segments 
the new allocation method was adopted based on an internal review to more accurately reflect the segment occupancy expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  primarily due to the classification of certain assets as held for sale  which properties were not depreciated beginning in july  the date of this determination  in accordance with the relevant accounting literature  and the sale of consolidated amerihost inn hotels during the last twelve months  offset by the opening of newly constructed hotels  and the acquisition or consolidation of existing hotels 
consequently  the hotels classified as held for sale were depreciated for all of  if open  and only partially in leasehold rents hotels decreased slightly during compared to the  due to the disposition of one leased hotel during the first quarter of  the purchase of one leased amerihost inn hotel and the termination of another non amerihost inn hotel lease upon its expiration during the third quarter of  partially offset by annual rent increases pursuant to the lease agreements 
corporate general and administrative expense increased due primarily to increases in professional fees  directors and officers liability insurance  and director expenses 
director expenses include director fees  which were revised in to be competitive with other public companies of a similar size  including non cash compensation in the form of equity  and increases in travel costs associated with a greater number of directors residing outside the chicago metropolitan area 
in addition  the increase in corporate general and administrative expense for also includes the non recurring reimbursement of a portion of the out of pocket costs and professional fees in the amount of approximately  incurred by the committee to enhance shareholder value  which was responsible for the election of two of our independent directors at the annual meeting 
this reimbursement was approved unanimously by all disinterested members of the company s board 
the hotel impairment provision was recorded primarily in connection with our plan for the disposition of certain hotel assets that we intend to market for sale as discussed above 
the amount represents an adjustment for certain hotel assets to decrease the carrying value of the assets to the anticipated market value  net of closing costs 
the impairment adjustment includes million  pre tax  related to amerihost inn hotels to be sold which has been included in operating income 
an additional  pre tax  related to non amerihost inn hotels to be sold has been included in discontinued operations in the accompanying statements of operations 
operating income by segment 
the following discussion of operating income by segment excludes any corporate general and administrative expense and the non cash hotel impairment charges 
operating income from consolidated amerihost inn hotels decreased due to increases in certain expenses  including insurance  real estate taxes  energy  general and administrative  and maintenance  a decrease in same room revenues  and certain new hotels operating during their ramping up stage when revenues are typically lower 
operating income from the hotel development segment in decreased to an operating loss in due to the decrease in hotels developed and constructed for third parties and minority owned entities during  compared with operating income from hotel sales and commissions increased due to the sale of more amerihost inn hotels and at a greater total profit during  versus the sale of amerihost inn hotels during the decrease in hotel management segment operating income during was due primarily to a reduction in hotels managed 
employee leasing operating income decreased slightly  due primarily to the decrease in hotel employee payroll expenses 
office building rental operating income decreased  attributable to the change in allocation of expenses among our other business segments 
operating income from hotel operations  and the related cash flow  has declined significantly over the past two years 
operating income from hotel operations  excluding impairment provision  declined approximately  from million in to million in  or  and declined further by million to approximately  in  or 
this two year total decline of million can be attributed to many factors  including i the overall downturn in the economy  ii significant increases in several operating costs such as labor  utilities  insurance and maintenance  iii additional supply of hotel rooms in the markets in which our hotels are located  iv geopolitical events  including terrorism and the conflict in iraq  v the elimination of hotels with positive operating cash flow  upon their sale  and vi a significant decline in the operating margins for the one non amerihost inn hotel not classified under discontinued operations since we operate the hotel under a long term lease 
we believe that aggregate hotel revenue growth is critical to improving the results of our hotel operations 
as such  if our revenue enhancement programs are not successful  or if the economy does not improve  or if the economy improves without a corresponding improvement in the lodging industry  it could have a significant  negative impact on our results of operation and financial condition 
interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense during compared to was attributable to the reduction in our overall level of debt as a result primarily of i 
the sale of consolidated hotels and the use of proceeds to payoff the related mortgage debt and a portion of our operating line of credit  and ii 
interest rate reductions on floating rate debt  partially offset by the mortgage financing of newly constructed or acquired consolidated hotels  and a higher interest rate on our operating line of credit 
interest expense does not include interest incurred on hotels under development and construction 
we capitalize interest expense incurred during the pre opening construction period of a consolidated hotel project  as part of the total development cost 
the amount capitalized includes both interest charges from a direct construction loan  plus interest computed at our incremental borrowing rate on the total costs incurred to date in excess of the construction loan funding 
gain on sale of assets 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement for the sale of the amerihost inn brand name and franchising rights to cendant corporation in  we were due three annual installments of  each  on september    and the company received each of the  payments as scheduled  including the final installment in these payments have been classified as gain on sale of assets in the consolidated financial statements 
as part of our strategy to focus primarily on the development and sale of new amerihost inn hotels  we intend to sell all our owned  non amerihost inn hotels 
during  two joint ventures in which we were a partner sold their non amerihost inn hotels  including one subsequent to the adoption of the formal plan to sell hotels  and the lease for one non amerihost inn hotel expired without renewal 
the net proceeds from these sales were minimal 
any gain or loss on the sale of these hotels will be reported as discontinued operations 
change in equity of affiliates 
the change in equity of affiliates during  compared to  was primarily attributable to the recognition of our share of the operations in excess of our stated ownership interest as a result of our position as general partner 
distributions from affiliates were  during the twelve months ended december   compared to  during the twelve months ended december  results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the following tables set forth our selected operations data for the twelve month periods ended december  and this data should be read in conjunction with our financial statements in item on this form k

revenues from consolidated amerihost inn hotels decreased due to the sale of five consolidated amerihost inn hotels to cendant franchisees  whereby the operations of these hotels were included in our hotel operations segment during all  or part of  however  such hotels were not included during all or part of in addition  same room revenues for all consolidated amerihost inn hotels  including the sold hotels prior to their sale date  increased approximately 
the decrease in revenues from consolidated amerihost inn hotels was partially offset by this same room revenue increase and the opening of two newly constructed amerihost inn hotels 
our hotel revenues were impacted by general economic and industry conditions  and an increase in competition in certain markets  primarily from newly constructed hotels 
as a result  we experienced increased downward pressure on occupancy levels and average daily rates 
hotel development revenues are directly related to the number of hotels being developed and constructed for minority owned entities or unrelated third parties  and the timing of the construction period 
we constructed two hotels for minority owned entities during and one for an unrelated third party  compared to two minority owned hotels during we closed on the sale of four wholly owned amerihost inn hotels during  and four wholly owned amerihost inn hotels during in addition  we facilitated the sales of one amerihost inn hotel leased to us by pmc during and five hotels during these sales generated hotel sales revenues and commissions of approximately million in and approximately million in hotel management revenue decreased  due primarily to the decrease in the number of hotels managed for third parties and minority owned entities 
employee leasing revenue decreased  due primarily to the reduction in rooms managed for minority owned entities and unrelated third parties as described above  a concerted effort to decrease hotel employee payroll costs which is the basis for the employee leasing revenue 
in addition  during  we began treating our workers compensation insurance cost as a pass through cost  whereby the hotels reimburse us for the insurance cost  however it is not shown as part of our employee leasing operating cost and revenue since the revenue is based on employee leasing cost 
the workers compensation insurance cost has never been included for purposes of computing our administrative fee 
development incentive and royalty sharing revenue increased as a result of our sale of additional amerihost inn hotels and the increase in the number of non company owned amerihost inn hotels franchised with cendant 
we received approximately million and million during and  respectively  in development incentive fees from the sale of amerihost inn hotels 
approximately  and  were recognized during and  respectively  from the amortization of this deferred income 
we also recorded approximately  and  in royalty sharing revenue during and  respectively 
office building rental consisting of leasing activities from our office building  increased due to a full year of ownership in compared to three months in we occupied approximately of the rentable square feet in the building in operating costs and expenses 
total operating costs and expenses increased  primarily due to an increase in operating costs from hotel development  partially offset by decreases in operating costs from hotel operations  sale of hotels and commissions  and employee leasing as described below 
a decrease in operating costs in the hotel operations segment was due primarily to the fewer number of hotels included in this segment hotels at december   as compared to hotels at december  operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues for the consolidated amerihost inn hotels decreased due to the increase in some room revenues and the minimization of certain operating expenses by hotel personnel 
operating costs and expenses for the hotel development segment increased  consistent with the increase in hotel development revenues for operating costs and expenses in the hotel development segment as a percentage of segment revenue increased during due to the higher level of projects for third parties and joint ventures  in the hotel construction phase of the overall process  which has a higher ratio of operating costs to revenues  compared to the ratio of operating costs to revenues for pre construction  hotel development activity 
the results for consisted of a greater amount of pre construction  hotel development activity  which resulted in lower operating costs in relation to the revenue recognized 
hotel management segment operating costs and expenses decreased primarily due to the decrease in the number of hotel rooms operated and managed for unrelated third parties and minority owned entities 
employee leasing operating costs and expenses decreased during  compared to  consistent with the decrease in segment revenue for and office building rental operating costs and expenses consisted primarily of expenses related to the management of our office building 
on october   the company purchased the office building in which its headquarters is located and assumed the landlord duties for the other tenants 
certain of the office building costs were allocated to the other operating segments 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  primarily due to the sale of consolidated amerihost inn hotels during the last twelve months  offset by the opening of newly constructed hotels  the acquisition or consolidation of existing hotels  and the depreciation of the office building in the fourth quarter of leasehold rents hotels decreased slightly during compared to  due to the disposition of six leased hotels during and  partially offset by annual rent increases 
corporate general and administrative expense increased approximately  in expenses related to the resignation and replacement of the company s president ceo in the results for reflect the recognition of  in one time expenses related to the issuance of stock options in to joint venture partners  including a director of the company  pursuant to the variable accounting rules of financial accounting standard board statement no 
 in connection with the sale of the amerihost inn brand and franchising rights 
the hotel impairment provision was recorded primarily in connection with the anticipated disposition of certain hotel assets  and as a result of our internal hotel asset impairment analysis 
the amount represents an adjustment for certain hotel assets to decrease the carrying value of the assets to the anticipated fair market value  net of closing costs 
operating income by segment 
the following discussion of operating income by segment excludes any corporate general and administrative expense and the non cash hotel impairment charges 
operating income from consolidated amerihost inn hotels increased slightly due to an increase in same room revenues  and decreases in certain expenses 
operating income from the hotel development segment in decreased to an operating loss in due to the decrease in hotels developed and constructed for third parties and minority owned entities during  compared with operating income from hotel sales and commissions decreased due to the sale of five amerihost inn hotels during versus the sale of nine amerihost inn hotels during the decrease in hotel management segment operating income during the year of was due primarily to a reduction in hotels managed 
employee leasing operating income decreased slightly  due primarily to the decrease in hotel employee payroll expenses 
office building rental operating income increased  attributable to a full year of ownership in compared to three months in interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense during compared to was attributable to the reduction in our overall level of debt in connection with the sale of amerihost inn hotels and the use of proceeds to payoff the related mortgage debt  and the interest rate reductions on floating rate debt  was offset by the mortgage financing of newly constructed or acquired consolidated hotels 
gain on sale of assets 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement for the sale of the amerihost inn brand name and franchising rights to cendant corporation in  the company was due three annual installments of  each 
the company received the first and second installments of  each as scheduled in and these payments have been classified as gain on sale of assets in the consolidated financial statements 
change in equity of affiliates 
the change in equity of affiliates during  compared to  was primarily attributable to the sale of two unconsolidated minority owned properties in at a significant gain  offset by an impairment provision on a non amerihost inn hotel of  during the second quarter of and the recognition of of the net operating losses from two additional unconsolidated joint ventures during the company exchanged a note receivable from the principals of diversified innkeepers  inc in the amount of approximately million on september   for a ownership interest in a hotel joint venture 
this exchange was accounted for at fair value and resulted in no gain or loss 
the company had previously managed this hotel for diversified innkeepers  inc pursuant to a management contract 
since the company does not control the major decisions of this joint venture  this investment has been accounted for by the equity method 
distributions from affiliates were  during  including a  note receivable pursuant to the sale of a hotel  compared to  during off balance sheet arrangements through wholly owned subsidiaries  we are a general partner or managing member in joint ventures as of december  as a general partner  we are secondarily liable for the obligations and liabilities of these joint venture partnerships 
as of december   these joint ventures had million outstanding under mortgage loan agreements  compared to million as of december  approximately million of this amount has been included in our consolidated financial statements as of december   reflecting the debt owed by joint ventures in which we have a majority or controlling ownership interest  leaving approximately million in off balance sheet mortgage debt owed by unconsolidated joint ventures 
if we subsequently obtain a majority or controlling ownership interest in a joint venture  the joint venture s debt will be included in our consolidated financial statements 
of this million of financing  we also have provided approximately million in guarantees to the lenders 
other partners have also guaranteed million of these financings  which may ultimately impact the exposure on our guarantees 
one unconsolidated joint venture mortgage loan in the amount of approximately million at december  matured on november   however the lender has extended the maturity of the loan to november   and waived the minimum debt service coverage ratio covenant violation for unless the properties collateralizing the debt are sold  the remaining joint venture mortgage loans mature after 
see also liquidity and capital resources below 
in connection with our plan to increase hotel development through joint ventures  we anticipate that the total off balance sheet mortgage debt on joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest  will increase 
the level of guarantees we provide on this debt may also increase accordingly  however this will be determined on a project by project basis  and provided only if deemed appropriate 
from time to time  we advance funds to these joint ventures for working capital and renovation projects 
the advances bear interest at rates ranging from prime to per annum and are due upon demand 
interest is accrued in all loans  and paid to us periodically 
the advances totaled million at december   and are included in investments in and advances to unconsolidated hotel joint ventures in our consolidated financial statements 
we expect the joint ventures to repay these advances primarily from the sale of the related hotels  and cash flow generated from hotel operations  however there is no guarantee that we will recover the entire amounts advanced or any interest accrued 
these advances will be repaid to us prior to distributions being paid to the partners 
we apply the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  with respect to mortgage loan guarantees for joint ventures in which the company is a partner 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures required by the guarantor and requires the guarantor to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken and to amortize the guarantee over the term of the guarantee 
during  the company provided a guarantee related to the mortgage debt of a joint venture in which it shares the responsibility of the guarantee on a joint and several basis with its joint venture partners 
the guarantee is effective for the year term of the mortgage loan 
we have recorded as an additional investment in this joint venture  and a liability for our share of this guarantee of approximately  as of december   its estimated fair value at the time of issuance  less accumulated amortization 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether or not it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january we are required to adopt the requirements of fin r for interim periods beginning after march  this interpretation requires that we present any variable interest entities in which it has a majority variable interest on a consolidated basis in our financial statements 
we are continuing to assess the provisions of this interpretation and the impact to us of adopting this interpretation 
therefore the following amounts may change based upon additional analysis 
due to the adoption of this interpretation  we expect that we will begin to present our investments in four joint ventures in which we have a majority variable interest  as determined in accordance with the provisions of this interpretation  on a consolidated basis in our financial statements beginning with the consolidated financial statements issued for the quarterly period ended june  the consolidation of these joint ventures is expected to add approximately million in assets and million in liabilities to our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had investments in  and advances to  these joint ventures of approximately million  which was presented as such under the equity method of accounting in our consolidated financial statements 
we expect that we will continue to present all of our other unconsolidated investments under the equity method 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we currently lease hotels from pmc commercial trust pursuant to an amended and restated master agreement dated january  in january  we amended the master lease with pmc to provide for the purchase of eight unidentified hotels from the lessor under specified terms  and to extend the initial lease term by five years 
the amendment provides for four increases in rent payments if these hotels are not sold to a third party or purchased by us by the dates specified 
as of december   the first three scheduled rent increases were not effective due to the sale of hotels by pmc to us 
the third scheduled increase was avoided in september  when we purchased a hotel from pmc  using cash of approximately  and mortgage financing provided by pmc of approximately million 
if we do not either facilitate the sale to a third party  or purchase from pmc  one hotel at a price of approximately million by june   the fourth rent increase becomes effective computed as of the original sales values  or approximately  on an annual basis 
if we decide to purchase this hotel by june   we intend to fund the million purchase price with a combination of mortgage debt  the source of which has not yet been identified  and cash from operations or working capital 
however  there can be no assurance that we will have the liquidity and or acceptable financing available to purchase this hotel at that time  and the rent increase would become effective 
we have entered into discussions with pmc to restructure the lease agreements  including our potential obligation for the purchase of the hotel by june  
see also part business  under the heading leased hotel properties  and below  under the heading subsequent events 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in restructuring the lease agreements  or that such restructuring will eliminate this purchase obligation or alternatively  the scheduled rent increase without the required purchase 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  including off balance sheet mortgage loan guarantees provided for certain joint ventures payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt consolidated      long term debt of assets held for sale non amerihost inn hotels      long term debt of assets held for sale amerihost inn hotels      corporate line of credit   operating leases consolidated      construction contracts   total      long term debt unconsolidated joint ventures at      operating leases unconsolidated total      we expect these obligations to be funded through operations  including the sale of hotels  or refinanced extended prior to maturity 
currently  the sale of the remaining hotels as part of our hotel disposition plan  is expected to generate net cash of approximately million to million  after the repayment of the related mortgage debt which is included in the amounts above 
see risk factors discussed below 
actual sales prices may be materially less than what we expect 
there is no assurance  for example  that we will generate the expected proceeds associated with the strategic plan for hotel disposition 
liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to fund normal recurring expenses  meet debt service requirements including the repayment or refinancing of approximately million of hotel mortgage indebtedness that matures within the twelve month period  meet the obligations under our operating line of credit  including the million reduction on its maximum availability over the next months  meet lease payment obligations of approximately million  primarily to pmc commercial trust  subject to ongoing discussions as described herein  fund capital expenditures  primarily hotel and office building improvements of approximately million to million  to the extent available  we also need funds for the following growth activities fund equity contributions on joint venture development projects  and for wholly owned hotel development projects  if any  fund development costs not covered under construction loans 
in addition  we are obligated to purchase a hotel from pmc for a total purchase price of million by june  we are currently in discussions with pmc  regarding several of the specific terms within the lease agreements  however there can be no assurance that this obligation will be terminated 
if we choose not to purchase this hotel from pmc  our rent on the entire hotel portfolio will increase by approximately  per year 
we expect to fund these liquidity needs and obligations using cash flows generated by operations  particularly from hotel sales  and by financing activities 
hotel revenue  hotel development fees  proceeds from the sale of hotels  including fees received from cendant  and other income from operations are our principal sources of cash flow used to pay the hotel and corporate operating expenses and obligations mentioned above 
we also have a corporate line of credit  however the availability under this facility is decreasing significantly  from its current maximum of million to million by the end of february we intend to pursue alternative sources of debt and equity financing  including longer term alternatives to our corporate line of credit  as discussed below 
during  the cash flow from hotel operations continued to decline  due to many factors such as downturn in the hotel industry for most of and its effect on hotel room demand  increased competition in our markets  and increasing operating costs such as labor  maintenance  utilities and insurance 
the net cash flow from the operations of many of our hotels has been insufficient to support their related mortgage debt payments  or lease payments  primarily to pmc  as well as necessary and ongoing capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that these costs will not increase further at rates greater than our revenues 
in addition  our hotel development activity for joint ventures has also decreased over the past two years  with only one joint venture project completed in as a result  the cash flow from all of our business segments  with the largest amount funded by the sale of hotel properties  has been utilized to maintain liquidity and meet the line of credit availability reductions 
a smaller amount has been used for investment in new hotel development 
the factors impacting us in  as well as the reduction in the availability of our corporate line of credit  have at times created liquidity issues 
we have been able to maintain our liquidity primarily through the sale of hotels 
we believe that during the next twelve months  in order to maintain our liquidity  it is critical for us to continue to sell hotel properties 
in addition  we seek to increase income from our existing hotel properties by focusing on new revenue enhancement opportunities  and aggressive cost controls 
we believe that an upturn in the economy will result in increased demand for hotel rooms  including ours  and such upturn could result in significantly improved hotel operating results 
however  historically we have seen that lodging demand trends will typically lag six to nine months behind any such economic trends 
we have also been in discussions with pmc requesting a reduction in our subsidiary s monthly lease payment and other modifications 
our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the cost of new developments  property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements 
we expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following construction loans  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  income from operations  including the development and sales of real estate  joint ventures  issuances of additional common stock and or other equity securities  and our unsecured revolving line of credit 
in addition to our normal operational and growth oriented liquidity needs  other contingencies may also have a significant impact on us  including the impact of seasonality on our hotel operations and hotels sales  and the inability to pay off mortgage loans when maturing 
see risk factors below 
our hotels are seasonal in nature  with the second and third calendar quarters being the strongest from a cash flow standpoint  and the fourth and first calendar quarters being the weakest 
in addition  the buyers of our hotels tend to purchase hotels on a seasonal basis  wanting to acquire the property just in time for the stronger summer season 
as the sale of hotel properties is a critical part of our liquidity  our inability to sell during the winter months could have a negative impact on our liquidity  if we do not generate strong cash flow from our other segments  or if we do not have adequate financing sources 
we believe our revenues  together with proceeds from financing activities will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs 
however  material changes in these factors  including factors that could inhibit our ability to sell hotels under acceptable terms and within certain time frames  may adversely affect net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  would adversely affect our ability to fund debt service  lease obligations  capital expenditures  and other liquidity needs 
in addition  a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and certain mortgage notes 
cash flow summary the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in item financial statements and supplementary data 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively  or a decrease of approximately  the decrease was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows years ended december  in thousands increase decrease net cash provided by operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    increase decrease in cash cash provided by operating activities we have four main sources of cash from operating activities revenues from hotel operations  revenues from the sale of hotel assets  fees from development  construction and renovation projects  and hotel development incentive fees and royalty sharing pursuant to the cendant transaction 
to a lesser extent  we have these additional sources of cash from operating activities fees from management contracts  fees from employee leasing services  rental income from the ownership of an office building 
hotel operations approximately of our hotel operations revenue not received at checkout is generated through other businesses and contracts  such as direct billings to local companies using the hotel and third party hotel room brokers  which is usually paid within to days from billing 
we have implemented a number of initiatives to control costs at our hotels  especially in the areas of labor  insurance  utilities  and maintenance 
for example  we have reduced our housekeeping labor hours significantly  and were successful in reducing property and workers compensation insurance costs 
we have also started to implement energy control systems at a few hotels and are exploring the expansion of this program 
we have entered into discussions with pmc with the objective to restructure the long term lease agreements with our subsidiary 
one of the objectives of such restructuring is to improve the operating results and cash flow generated by these hotels through a permanent reduction in the monthly lease payment 
currently  our subsidiary s lease obligation for these hotels is approximately million per year  significantly greater than the operating cash flow generated from these hotels before the rent payment 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such restructuring  or that a restructuring will result in improved operational results for these hotels 
sale of hotels we typically receive an earnest money deposit from the buyer of a hotel when a sales contract is executed 
the remaining proceeds from the sale of hotel assets are received at the time of closing 
however  in certain instances  we have provided seller financing in the form of a note to the buyer with specified interest and repayment terms 
the decrease in cash flow from operations from to  due primarily to the decrease in cash flow from hotel operations  has been offset by the net cash proceeds generated from the sale of hotels 
the fluctuations in cash flow from the sale of hotels are directly related to number  size and value of the amerihost inn hotels sold 
on a cash basis  the net proceeds from the sale of wholly owned amerihost inn hotels  after the payoff of the related mortgage debt  and including commissions  was million in  million in  and million in in addition  net cash proceeds after the payoff of the related mortgage debt from the sale of non amerihost inn hotels  an activity which is included in discontinued operations rather than operating income  was  in we also received  per year in   and from cendant  in connection with the sale of the amerihost inn brand name in the amount received in was the last installment of the initial fees 
we intend to continue to sell hotels  as discussed above under hotel disposition plan and restructuring 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell hotel assets under terms acceptable to us  and the timing and estimated proceeds from any such sales could differ materially from that anticipated 
historically  we have experienced greater activity in hotels for sale from prospective buyers during the second and third calendar quarters  versus the first and fourth quarters  consistent with the seasonality of the hotel operations 
we have had a few hotels under contract for sale scheduled to close during the fourth quarter of or first quarter of that have been delayed or fallen out of contract 
the timing of hotel sales can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  many of our historical buyers obtain debt financing under various us small business administration sba loan guarantee programs 
due to the recent federal budget issues  certain sba programs  and all loans currently being underwritten and documented under this program  were significantly delayed 
in fact  one hotel which was under contract for sale and scheduled to close in december  was delayed by sba financing issues and the sale was not consummated until the end of march the seasonality of the hotel sales  as well as the delays from numerous factors  including buyer financing  can create significant liquidity issues for us  especially at times when our hotel operations cash flow may be minimal or negative  after debt service and lease obligations  as during the winter months 
currently  we expect to realize net cash proceeds of approximately to million from the sale of the remaining hotels in the plan for hotel disposition  after the payoff of the related mortgage debt  and exclusive of any cendant fees 
five hotels are currently under contract for sale  which are expected to be consummated within the next six months 
under the terms of the contracts  these anticipated sales are expected to generate approximately million in gross proceeds and the reduction of mortgage debt of approximately million 
however  there can be no assurance that these hotel sales will be consummated as anticipated 
any forecasted amounts from these sales could differ from the final amounts included in the company s quarterly and annual financial statements when issued 
hotel development fees from development  construction and renovation projects are typically received within to days from billing 
due to the procedures in place for processing our construction draws  we typically do not pay our contractors until we receive our draw from the equity or lending source 
developing hotels for joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest  and third parties  has historically provided stronger returns and cash flow  compared to the longer term returns from developing and operating hotels for our own account 
in addition  our equity contribution is much less for a joint venture development project  as most of the cash equity is contributed by our partners 
however  many of the same factors affecting hotel operations  as discussed above  have also had an impact on our ability to develop hotels for third parties and for joint ventures  and as a result  this development activity has declined from to we currently have several projects under development for joint ventures  or which will be marketed to joint venture partners  and our goal is to significantly increase this activity in the future  provided that we can find acceptable sites to locate the hotels  find acceptable joint venture partners with sufficient equity  maintain sufficient liquidity to make our share of capital contributions  as needed  and that the joint venture can obtain the necessary mortgage debt financing on acceptable terms 
fees from cendant the development incentive fee from cendant is a one time fee typically received within days of the simultaneous closing of the sale of an amerihost inn hotel and the execution by the buyer of a franchise agreement with cendant  including all proper documentation  and subject to certain conditions 
royalty sharing payments from cendant are received monthly  based on the actual royalty payments received by cendant from all amerihost inn hotel franchisees  except those operated by us 
we received million  million  and million during   and  respectively  in development incentive fees 
these fees may be refundable to cendant if the buyer of our amerihost inn hotel defaults under their franchise agreement with cendant during the first months 
however  any such amounts due would be reduced by a portion of any damages recovered by cendant and would only be paid by us an offset against future fees earned 
to date  there have been no defaults  and we have not had to repay any incentive fees 
we received royalty sharing fees from cendant in the amount of  in  which is based on the royalty fees cendant receives for all non arlington hospitality amerihost inn hotels in their franchise system 
we will receive royalty sharing payments through under the terms of the agreement with cendant  including fees from amerihost inn hotels that are not developed or operated by us 
while we expect this cash flow to increase as the amerihost inn brand is expanded  there can be no assurance that cendant will be able to sell additional amerihost inn franchises  or that we will be able to sell existing or newly developed amerihost inn hotels to third party operators 
cendant must approve the franchise applications of the buyers of our amerihost inn hotels  which approval is based solely on cendant s evaluation of the buyers experience and ability to effectively operate the hotels  the physical condition of the hotels  and other factors 
if we choose to sell an amerihost inn hotel  where the buyer does not execute an amerihost inn franchise agreement  we may be subject to liquidated damages to cendant under our franchise agreements  which is computed as a percentage of room revenue or a fixed amount per room  and their would be no incentive fee nor ongoing revenue sharing fees paid to us by cendant 
other sources we receive management fees and employee leasing fees which result in a relatively smaller amount of cash flow  after the payment of related expenses in comparison to the activities discussed above 
these fees and cash flow could increase as we develop and manage more hotels for joint ventures  as anticipated 
in addition  we receive rental income from the other tenants in our office building 
owning our office building assists us in minimizing our own corporate headquarter occupancy costs 
cash used in investing activities cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions  invest in joint ventures  to make loans to affiliated hotels for the purpose of construction  renovation and working capital  for new hotel development  for recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures  and from time to time  for the purchase of our own common stock 
we selectively invest in new projects that meet our investment criteria and enable us to take advantage of our development and property management skills 
cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended december  and  consisted of the following in thousands investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  net of distributions and collections on advances from affiliates purchase of property and equipment   acquisitions of partnership interests issuance of notes receivable  net of collections the cash used in investing was partially offset by proceeds from the sales of real estate   total   the purchase of property and equipment includes all construction  furniture and fixtures costs for three new hotel projects  which opened in  and two new hotels opened in however  two of the three hotels opened in  opened during the first quarter  and most of the project cost was incurred in we spent million on new construction in  versus million in we expect these costs to be lower than historically  as we focus on new development for joint ventures and others 
in addition  the amounts for and include the acquisition of amerihost inn hotels from joint ventures 
from time to time  we advance funds to these joint ventures for working capital and renovation projects 
in  we advanced  to joint ventures in which we are a partner  net of repayments  primarily for working capital purposes 
we expect the joint ventures to repay these advances primarily through the sale of the hotel  and cash flow generated from hotel operations  however in certain cases  we may not realize the entire amounts advanced 
in all cases  these advances will be repaid to us prior to any distributions to our partners 
in  we expect to continue advancing funds to certain joint ventures for working capital purposes 
if we do not continue to support these joint ventures for working capital needs and debt service  it may create defaults under their mortgage agreements  which in most cases have been guaranteed by us 
in addition  in we invested approximately  in new and existing joint ventures  net of approximately  in distributions received from joint ventures 
this amount included approximately  for a new development project expected to open in  and approximately  that was used for working capital purposes 
cash used in financing activities cash used in financing activities was million during  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million during  summarized as follows in thousands principal payments on long term debt   net repayments on operating line of credit  common stock repurchases distributions to minority interests the cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds from issuance of long term debt   issuance of common stock principal payments on long term debt include the payoffs of mortgages upon the sale of hotel properties of approximately million in  and million in we paid off hotel mortgages in  compared to five hotel mortgages in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt includes approximately million in and million in  as a result of opening five newly constructed consolidated amerihost inn hotels during and future hotel development is dependent upon our ability to attain mortgage debt financing 
lenders typically advance mortgage debt at the rate of of total project value 
assuming the total value of a new hotel development is million  the typical mortgage loan amount would range from million to million 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such mortgage financing on terms acceptable to us  to support our growth objectives 
our board of directors has authorized a common stock buy back  at any time and without notice  of up to  shares under certain conditions and consistent with securities laws governing these buybacks 
under this authorization  in we repurchased  shares for a total of approximately  in addition  in we executed a reverse forward stock split whereby the shares held by shareholders owning less than shares on the effective date were redeemed and converted into the right to receive cash from the company 
the shareholders owning at least shares were not impacted 
as a result of the reverse forward split  approximately  shares were converted to the right to receive per share  or a total of approximately  of which approximately  was funded through december  we consider the reverse forward split a one time transaction  and we do not anticipate a similar transaction in the foreseeable future 
all shares that we have repurchased or redeemed have been retired 
in addition   options to purchase stock were exercised during resulting in proceeds to us of approximately  construction line of credit we had a million loan facility  which provided for new construction financing that automatically converted to permanent financing upon opening 
we utilized this facility primarily for the construction of wholly owned amerihost inn properties  as approved by the lender on a project by project basis 
we still have three outstanding hotel mortgages which were originated through this facility  with a total outstanding balance of million at december  however  the lender s commitment to review and underwrite new construction projects under this facility expired on october  under this facility  we had availability  up to million  less any loans outstanding  for new hotel development projects  subject to lender approval 
to the extent a hotel was sold which had been financed with the facility  and the related mortgage is paid off  it would create availability for the lender to review new hotel development financing 
we are currently seeking to renew this construction line of credit facility  however we do not know when  or if  the lender will approve  and there can be no assurance that this facility  or a version of this facility  will be available for future development projects 
in the meantime  this lender continues to review and underwrite the debt financing for some of our current development projects on a per project basis  and has approved a pre commitment for the construction and long term mortgage loan for one joint venture project where we have an active land purchase contract 
as an alternative to  or in addition to this facility  we intend to explore alternative financing sources for new construction and long term permanent mortgage financing to assist us in the development of amerihost inn hotels 
mortgage debt the table below summarizes our mortgage notes payable as of december  and in thousands outstanding balance fixed rate   variable rate   total   percent of total debt fixed rate variable rate total weighted average interest rate at end of period fixed rate variable rate total the variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various spreads over the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate 
the company s plan to sell certain hotel assets is expected to result in the payoff of the related mortgage debt in the amount of approximately million  which has been classified in current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  this amount includes i one hotel mortgage in the amount of approximately million which was extended subsequent to december  for a two year period  ii one hotel loan in the amount of million which matures in august  and iii approximately million in principal payments which are contractually due within the next twelve months regardless of the plan for hotel disposition 
we have received notice from the lender on the loan which matures in august indicating that they will not be extending or renewing the loan 
we expect this hotel to be sold prior to its maturity  as it is currently being actively marketed for sale as part of our plan for hotel disposition  with the proceeds to be used to payoff the mortgage loan 
however  based on our current estimates  we anticipate that the net proceeds from the sale of this hotel will be less than the outstanding mortgage balance by approximately   this shortfall will need to be funded by us upon the sale of the property  or it could be an event of default  absent any other agreement with this lender 
although not contractually due in  another hotel mortgage loan matures on january  in the amount of approximately million 
we also expect this loan to be repaid prior to maturity with proceeds from the sale of the hotel  as it is also being actively marketed 
if these hotels are not sold by their maturity dates  we are currently obligated to payoff the mortgage notes using funds from other sources  if available  including mortgage refinancings with other lenders  or if not paid off  we would be in default of the mortgage agreements  absent any other agreement with these lenders 
however  there can be no assurance that these hotels will be sold by their loan maturity dates  or that alternative financing will be available if needed 
if these hotels are not sold prior to their loan maturity dates  and absent an extension by the current lenders  or a refinancing with another lender  it could have a significant impact on our liquidity 
with respect to mortgages on hotels which are not held for sale  approximately million is classified in current liabilities  which is the principal amortization due within the next twelve months 
the company also has a mortgage loan on the office building in which its headquarters is located  and on october   the lender extended the maturity date to january  the office building loan bears interest at the floating rate of either prime minus or libor plus  as determined by us 
certain of our hotel mortgage notes and our office building mortgage note contain financial covenants  principally minimum net worth requirements  debt to equity ratios  and minimum debt service coverage ratios 
these financial covenants are typically measured annually  based upon our fiscal year end 
at december   we were not in compliance with the minimum debt service coverage ratio contained in two hotel mortgage loans aggregating approximately million 
the lender for one of these mortgage loans which matures in august has indicated they will not be extending or renewing the loan  as discussed above 
with respect to the other mortgage loan  we have obtained a waiver from the lender 
other mortgage debt guaranteed by the company we are a general partner or managing member in joint ventures as of december   of which had mortgage debt 
the following is a summary of the mortgage debt held by the various types of joint ventures no 
of hotels balance outstanding guarantee balance consolidated joint ventures in which we have a majority or controlling interest  unconsolidated joint ventures in which we are a general partner   unconsolidated joint ventures in which we are a managing member of a limited liability company   the mortgage balances for the two consolidated joint ventures have been included in our financial statements at december  the aggregate maturities on this long term mortgage debt  excluding consolidated joint ventures  regardless of the plan for hotel disposition  are approximately as follows  including that portion related to our guarantees in thousands year ending december  amount guaranteed thereafter   the mortgage balances for the unconsolidated joint ventures has not been included in our consolidated balance sheet 
other partners have also guaranteed a portion of these financings  which may ultimately reduce the exposure on our guarantees 
approximately million of the mortgage debt with unconsolidated joint ventures relates to five properties that have been identified to be sold as part of our strategic hotel disposition plan 
one mortgage in the amount of approximately million matures in november this mortgage had matured on november   however the lender extended the maturity for one year  and waived a covenant violation for the minimum debt service coverage ratio for this hotel is included in the hotel disposition plan  and we expect this hotel to be sold prior to the loan maturity  with the net proceeds being used to pay off the mortgage 
however  if the joint venture is unable to sell the hotel prior to the loan maturity  on acceptable terms  and the lender is unwilling to extend the maturity date of the loan  or if acceptable alternative financing is not available  it could create a default on behalf of the joint venture whereby the lender would look to us for repayment of the loan under our guarantee  possibly creating significant liquidity issues for us

operating line of credit at december   we had million outstanding under its operating line of credit with lasalle bank na 
the operating line of credit has a limit of million  as reduced from million on february   is collateralized by substantially all the assets of the company subject to first mortgages from other lenders on hotel assets  bears interest at the rate of prime plus per annum  with a minimum rate of per annum  and was scheduled to mature on april  the credit line provides for the maintenance of certain financial covenants  including minimum tangible net worth  a maximum leverage ratio  minimum debt service coverage ratio  and minimum net income 
we were not in compliance with the minimum tangible net worth requirement  and the minimum net income requirement as of december  however  the lender has waived these violations in connection with the renewal of the line of credit set forth below 
in march  we accepted a commitment from this lender  to renew the line of credit through april   with a maximum available of million  reducing to million on june   reducing further to million on august   and to million on february  notwithstanding the scheduled reductions  the lender has required that the majority of the proceeds from the sale of hotel properties must be used to reduce the line of credit balance until the balance is at or below million  at which time the maximum available will be reduced to million  even if prior to the august  scheduled reduction date  above 
the commitment is subject to the closing of the renewed loan by april  in addition  the terms of the agreement were revised to provide for interest at the fixed rate of per annum 
the renewed credit line provides for the maintenance of certain types of financial covenants  similar to those in the previous credit line 
we intend to pursue longer term financing options with other lenders that is consistent with our business plan of developing  building and selling amerihost inn hotels and expect to engage an investment financial advisor in the near future to assist us in this undertaking 
however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain an alternative credit facility of longer duration under terms and conditions that we deem satisfactory 
lease purchase obligation under the terms of our existing arrangement with pmc  if we do not either facilitate the sale to a third party  or purchase from pmc  one of our leased hotels at a price of approximately million by to june   a rent increase of approximately  on an annual basis  becomes effective 
if we decide to purchase this hotel by to june   we intend to fund the million purchase price with a combination of mortgage debt  the source of which has not yet been identified  and cash from operations or working capital 
however  there can be no assurance that we will have the liquidity and or acceptable financing available to purchase this hotel at that time  and the rent increase could become effective 
as discussed above  we intend to address this purchase obligation as part of our ongoing discussions with pmc  however there can be no assurance that an alternative agreement will be in place prior to june  seasonality the lodging industry  in general  is seasonal by nature 
our hotel revenues are generally greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth quarters due to weather conditions in the primarily midwest markets in which many of our hotels are located  as well as general business and leisure travel trends 
this seasonality can be expected to continue to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors  securities and geopolitical concerns and other general factors affecting travel 
in addition  hotel construction is seasonal  depending upon the geographic location of the construction projects 
construction activity in the midwest may be slower in the first and fourth calendar quarters due to weather conditions 
also  since our management fees are based upon a percentage of the hotel s total gross revenues  we are further susceptible to seasonal variations 
we have also experienced greater interest in hotel sales from prospective buyers during the second and third calendar quarters  consistent with the seasonality of hotel operations 
governmental regulation americans with disabilities act under the americans with disabilities act  or ada  all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
these requirements became effective in although significant amounts have been invested in ada required upgrades to our hotels  a determination that our hotels are not in compliance with the ada could result in a judicial order requiring compliance  imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
we are likely to incur additional costs in complying with the ada  however  such costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
environmental laws under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in property 
laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent real property or to borrow funds using real property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of these substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is or ever was owned or operated by those persons 
federal and state laws also regulate the operation and removal of underground storage tanks 
in connection with the ownership and operation of hotels  we could be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the regulated substances and storage tanks and claims related thereto 
we do not use underground storage tanks at our hotels 
in the few instances where we have had an underground storage tank  activities were undertaken to remove the underground storage tanks and fully remediate the site 
we are not aware of any underground storage tanks at any of the properties in our current portfolio  however there can be no assurance that such underground storage tanks do not exist  particularly at our older properties that we acquired as existing structures 
most of our hotels have undergone phase i environmental site assessments  which generally provide a non intrusive physical inspection and database search  but not soil or groundwater analyses  by a qualified independent environmental engineer 
the purpose of a phase i assessment is to identify potential sources of contamination for which the hotels may be responsible and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance 
the phase i assessments have not revealed any environmental liability or compliance concerns that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  nor are we aware of any material environmental liability or concerns 
nevertheless  it is possible that these environmental site assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns or that material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns exist of which we are currently unaware 
federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations require abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air 
asbestos containing materials may be present in various building materials such as sprayed on ceiling treatments  roofing materials  pipe insulation or floor tiles at some of our older hotels 
in instances where we became aware of such asbestos containing materials  such materials were contained or removed and abated 
to the best of our knowledge  we have not used any asbestos containing materials  which are not in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations  in our new hotel development projects 
any liability resulting from non compliance or other claims relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in recent years there has been a widely publicized proliferation of mold related claims by tenants  employees and other occupants of buildings against the owners of those buildings 
to date  we have experienced a few instances where mold was detected  however no such claims have been filed against us 
mold related claims are not covered by our insurance programs 
in every hotel where we have identified a measurable presence of mold  we have undertaken remediation we believe to be appropriate for the circumstances encountered 
unfortunately  there is little in the way of government standards  insurance industry specifications or otherwise generally accepted guidelines dealing with mold propagation 
although considerable research into mold toxicity and exposure levels is underway  it may be several years before definitive standards are available to property owners against which to evaluate risk and design appropriate remediation practices 
we cannot predict the outcome of any future regulatory requirements to deal with mold related matters 
we also do not believe that  currently  any potential mold related liabilities  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas and the disclosure requirements of statement no 
require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december   and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements 
during  the company has adopted the provisions of fasb no  including the reporting of the fair value of any options as a charge against earnings 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether or not it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company is required to adopt the requirements of fin r for interim periods beginning after march  this interpretation requires that the company present any variable interest entities in which it has a majority variable interest on a consolidated basis in its financial statements 
the company is continuing to assess the provisions of this interpretation and the impact to the company of adopting this interpretation 
therefore the following amounts may change based upon additional analysis 
due to the adoption of this interpretation  the company expects that it will begin to present its investments in four joint ventures in which it has a majority variable interest  as determined in accordance with the provisions of this interpretation  on a consolidated basis in its financial statements beginning with the consolidated financial statements issued for the quarterly period ended june  the consolidation of these joint ventures is expected to add approximately million in assets and million in liabilities to the company s consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the company had investments in  and advances to  these joint ventures of approximately million  which was presented as such under the equity method of accounting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company expects that it will continue to present all of its other unconsolidated investments under the equity method 
on may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
the issuance of sfas was intended to improve the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
sfas requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position and also requires disclosures about alternative ways of settling the instruments and the capital structure of entities  all of whose shares are mandatorily redeemable 
sfas affects the issuer s accounting for a number of freestanding financial instruments  including mandatorily redeemable shares  which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or other assets 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the effective date of a portion of the statement has been indefinitely postponed by the fasb 
the company does not expect that the implementation of sfas no 
will result in a material financial statement impact 
subsequent events in  we entered into discussions with pmc commercial trust  regarding amerihost inn hotels pmc owns which are leased and operated by our subsidiary 
due to numerous economic and market driven factors relating to these hotels  including the factors mentioned above  we have entered into discussions with pmc with the objective to restructure these long term lease agreements 
the objective of such restructuring is to improve our operating results and cash flow with respect to these hotels  and to agree on a plan that would transfer these hotels to third party operators through the sale of the properties 
on march   we entered into a temporary letter agreement with pmc that expires on april  the temporary letter agreement provides that base rent will continue to accrue at the rate of approximately  per month  as set forth in the lease agreements  however the base rent payments required to be paid on march  and april  were reduced to approximately  per month  with the march  payment being due and payable upon the execution of the temporary letter agreement 
in addition  our subsidiary was allowed to utilize  of its security deposit held with pmc to partially fund these payments 
upon the expiration of the temporary letter agreement on april   the deferred portion of the base rent approximately  will be payable and the security deposit is to be restored to its march  balance 
while the objective is to reach a restructured agreement prior to the expiration of the temporary letter agreement  there can be no assurance that the leases will be restructured on terms and conditions acceptable to us  if at all  or that a restructuring will improve operating results and cash flow  or provide for the sale of the hotels to third party operators 
in march  we accepted a commitment to renew our operating line of credit from the existing lender  lasalle bank na  through april   which we accepted and executed 
the revised terms require that the maximum availability under the facility from its current million level be reduced to million on june   further reduced to million on august   and further reduced to million on february  notwithstanding these scheduled reductions  the lender has required that the majority of the proceeds from the sale of hotel properties must be used to reduce the outstanding balance of the line of credit until the balance it at or below million  at which time the maximum availability on the line will be reduced to million  even if prior to the august  scheduled reduction date  above 
the terms of the agreement were further revised to provide for interest at the fixed rate of per annum 
the renewed credit line provides for the maintenance of certain types of financial covenants  as in the previous credit line 
in march  we sold two wholly owned amerihost inn hotels  generating gross proceeds of approximately million  and simultaneously paid off the related mortgage loans of approximately million 
risk factors the following important factors  among others  have affected  and may in the future continue to affect  our business  results of operations and financial condition  and could cause our operating results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf elsewhere in this report 
debt  capital  and liquidity we have substantial long term obligations  which could limit our flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition 
we have a significant amount of debt and obligations under long term leases  such as the leases with pmc  requiring us  or our subsidiaries  to dedicate a substantial portion of our  or their  cash flow from operations to make these required payments 
these payments reduce the cash flow otherwise available to fund capital expenditures  expansion efforts and other general corporate needs 
for the last three years our cash flow from hotel operations  after the payment of mortgage debt service  lease obligations  and ongoing capital expenditures  has been negative and we have used the proceeds from the sale of hotels to primarily fund these payments and other operational expenses 
there is no assurance that we will generate positive cash flow from hotel operations 
if our hotel operating cash flow or other sources of cash is not sufficient to fund our expenditures or to make our debt and lease payments  we will have to raise additional funds through the sale of capital stock  additional borrowings  or selling a greater number of assets and sooner than planned 
we cannot assure you that any of these sources would be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
an inability to fund our operating or capital needs  including our debt and lease payments  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
further  pursuant to a commitment letter from our existing line of credit provider to extend the facility for a one year period  we will be required to use the proceeds from the sale of hotel properties to repay draws on the line 
the maximum availability on this credit facility will decrease to million from its current million by august   and further to million by february   however the majority of net proceeds from the sale of hotels must be used to reduce the outstanding balance under the line of credit until our balance is at or below million  at which time the reduction of the line of credit availability to million will be accelerated 
there is no assurance that this line will be sufficient to meet our needs or that we would be able to obtain a replacement line on terms and conditions acceptable to us  if at all 
additionally  our loan facility for new construction expired on october   and we are currently attempting to renew the facility 
there is no assurance that we will be able to renew this facility 
if we are unable to renew this facility  or if we are unable to obtain an alternative new construction credit facility  or other hotel debt arrangements  on acceptable terms  our ability to develop new hotels will be significantly limited and our future prospects will be adversely effected 
we require significant amounts of capital in our business 
our business model requires us to have  or be able to obtain  significant amounts of capital 
we rely on the availability of debt or equity capital  including joint venture sources  or the sale of hotels  to fund hotel development and capital improvements 
we may not  however  be able to raise sufficient monies  or sell hotels  on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  geopolitical or global or regional trends and events deemed negative by debt and equity providers could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital for our business 
failure to adequately fund our business would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and interest expense 
most of the money we have borrowed requires us to pay interest that varies over time 
in addition  we may borrow money in the future requiring us to pay interest at variable rates 
accordingly  increases in interest rates have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition including our ability to pay increased interest costs 
we have restrictive debt covenants that could adversely affect our ability to run our business 
the agreement governing our corporate line of credit contains various restrictive covenants including  among others  provisions that could restrict our ability to borrow additional money  make common and preferred distributions  make capital expenditures or acquire or develop hotels in excess of certain amounts  engage in transactions with affiliates  make investments  including repurchasing our common stock  merge or consolidate with another person  and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  these agreements require us to maintain certain specified financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these ratios may be adversely affected by events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants and limitations could result in the accelerated payment of amounts outstanding under our line of credit 
we may not be able to refinance or repay our debt in full under those circumstances 
real estate and growth our development activities may be more costly and take longer than we have anticipated 
as part of our strategy  we plan to develop hotels for third parties and joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest 
development involves many substantial risks  including actual development costs may exceed budgeted or contracted amounts  construction delays may prevent us from opening hotels on schedule  we may not be able to obtain all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and construction permits  the properties may not achieve our desired revenue  operating profit  and profit on sale goals  and we compete for suitable development sites  and may not be able to locate attractive sites in terms of location or economic feasibility 
our ability to sell hotels in a timely manner and at favorable prices could be adversely affected by market conditions and other factors 
our ability to increase our revenues and operate profitably depends to a large extent on our ability to sell existing hotels  or hotels that we develop  at favorable prices 
the price and timing of each sale is affected by numerous factors  such as the demand and supply of hotel product and conditions in the real estate and capital markets  as well as the uncertainties associated with negotiating conditions and terms of sales and our buyer s ability to obtain sufficient financing 
in addition  our cash flow needs may dictate  to a certain extent  the timing of attempted sales 
for example  the sales price we can obtain for a hotel may be adversely affected because we may accelerate sale of a hotel to generate cash flow to fund other needs 
further  even if we do not accelerate the sale of any particular hotel or hotels  actual sales prices may be materially less than we expect 
there is no assurance  for example  that we will generate the expected proceeds from our formal plan for hotel disposition 
if we are not able to sell the hotels we develop in a timely manner and at favorable prices  our ability to find future growth  our ability to retire maturing debt  our revenues and our ability to operate profitably will be significantly impaired 
we will encounter risks that may adversely affect real estate ownership 
our investments in hotels are subject to the numerous risks generally associated with owning real estate  including among others adverse changes in general or local economic or real estate market conditions  changes in zoning laws  changes in traffic patterns and neighborhood characteristics  increases in assessed valuation and real estate tax rates  increases in the cost of property insurance  governmental regulations and fiscal policies  the potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses  the impact of environmental laws and regulations  and other circumstances beyond our control 
moreover  real estate investments are relatively illiquid  and we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions 
operational risks insufficient cash flow from many of our existing hotels 
the net cash flow from the operations of many of our hotels has been insufficient to support their related mortgage debt payments or long term lease obligations  as well as their necessary and ongoing capital expenditures 
this negative cash flow at many of our hotels affects several aspects of our business  including our ability to raise capital whether through debt or equity sources  our ability to purchase and or develop hotels  and our ability to make capital improvements to our existing hotels 
as described in the executive overview above  we have implemented strategies and programs to improve hotel operation results  and while the improvement in the economy and industry is expected to have a positive impact  there can be no assurance that such initiatives or expected positive impact from the economy will occur or will have a material position impact on our hotel operations 
if we are not able to restructure our lease agreements with pmc commercial trust  our financial results may suffer 
one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the lessee for hotels with pmc 
we have guaranteed the obligations under these leases 
to date  we have been making a significant portion of the lease payments for our subsidiary  since the cash flow generated by these hotels has been insufficient to cover the annual lease payment obligation of approximately million 
on march   we and our subsidiary entered into an interim agreement with pmc 
this interim agreement temporarily deferred a portion of the march and april payments required under the leases 
this interim agreement expires on april  at which time the deferred portion is due 
if this interim agreement is not renewed or extended  or a revised agreement not entered into  the terms of the original agreement will return in effect 
thus  if the operations of the hotels subject to the leases do not improve sufficiently  we will either have to continue subsidizing the lease payments or take other actions to restructure the leases 
any such actions could cause us to default under other credit agreements or our agreement with cendant 
any such default would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
our financial performance depends in part on cendant promoting and supporting the amerihost inn brand 
the successful operation of the hotels we own  operate or manage depends in part on the promotion of the amerihost brand by cendant  the owner of the amerihost inn brand and on cendant devoting sufficient resources to support services  such as reservation systems  frequent guest loyalty and marketing programs  provided to franchisees 
we do not control what cendant spends on brand promotion or franchisee support 
cendant s failure or inability to promote the amerihost brand or to provide adequate support to franchisees would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
further  if we sold an amerihost inn hotel and received a development incentive fee from cendant  since the hotel remained an amerihost inn hotel  and subsequently the buyer of the hotel defaults under the franchise agreement within the first months  under certain circumstances  we may be required to refund back to cendant  from future fees  a portion of the development incentive fee 
to date  we have not been required to refund any development incentive fees  however  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to refund development incentive fees in the future 
we may be adversely affected by the requirements contained in our franchise and licensing agreements 
as of december   all of our hotels were operated pursuant to existing franchise or licensing agreements with nationally recognized hotel brands 
the franchise agreements generally contain specific standards for  and restrictions and limitations on  the operation and maintenance of a hotel in order to maintain uniformity within the franchisor system 
standards are often subject to change over time  in some cases at the discretion of the franchisor  and may restrict a franchisee s ability to make improvements or modifications to a hotel without the consent of the franchisor 
in addition  compliance with standards could require us to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures 
action or inaction on our part could result in a breach of standards or other terms and conditions of the franchise agreements  and could result in the loss or cancellation of a franchise license 
loss of franchise licenses without replacement would likely have an adverse effect on our hotel revenues 
typically  the buyers of our hotels maintain the existing brand affiliation and enter into a franchise agreement with the franchisor upon the sale 
part of our strategic plan is to sell amerihost inn hotels to buyers who continue to operate the hotels as amerihost inn hotels 
as a result  cendant must approve the franchise application of the buyer  which is based solely on their evaluation of the buyer s experience and ability to effectively operate the hotel  the physical condition of the hotel  and other factors 
if we choose to sell an amerihost inn hotel  or other brand hotel  where the buyer does not execute an amerihost inn  or other  franchise agreement  we may be subject to liquidated damages under our franchise agreements  which is computed as a percentage of room revenue or a fixed amount per room 
uninsured and underinsured losses could result in loss of value of hotel properties 
our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully protect our business and assets from all claims or liabilities  including environmental liabilities 
further  we may not be able to obtain existing or additional insurance at commercially reasonable rates 
there are certain types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature or related to certain environmental liabilities  that are either uninsurable or not insurable at a reasonably affordable price 
in the event losses or claims are beyond the limits or scope of our coverage  our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may have to make significant capital improvements to maintain our hotel properties 
we may be required to replace  from time to time  furniture  fixtures and equipment and to make other capital improvements at the hotels we own  or lease and operate 
we must also make periodic capital improvements to comply with standards established by cendant  the franchisor of our hotels  under our franchise agreements 
generally  we are responsible for the costs of these capital improvements  which give rise to the following risks cost overruns and delays  the disruption to operations and potential lost room revenue associated with renovations  the cost of funding renovations and the possibility that financing for these renovations may not be available on attractive terms  and the return on our investment in these capital improvements may not be adequate 
in the past  we have generally funded capital improvements from cash flow from operations and  to a lesser degree  by borrowing 
our future cash flow may not be sufficient to fund future capital improvements and there is no assurance that we will be able to borrow any needed monies on acceptable terms  if at all 
thus  we may not be able to fund required capital improvements  which could cause us to default on certain agreements which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
our business is concentrated in particular segments of a single industry and our hotels are primarily operated under a single brand name 
nearly all of our business has been  and will likely continue to be  hotel related 
we are thus exposed to downturns in the hotel industry and are more susceptible to adverse conditions in the mid market segment of the hotel industry than more diversified hotel companies 
finally  our hotels are operated primarily under the amerihost brand name  and our success depends heavily on the strength of this single brand 
downturns in business or leisure travel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
we may not be able to effectively compete for guests with other branded and independent hotels 
the mid market segment of the hotel business is highly competitive 
our hotels compete on the basis of location  room rates and quality  service levels  reputation  and reservation systems  among many other factors 
there are many competitors in our market segment  and many of them or the brands under which they are franchisees  may have substantially greater number of hotels in their brands  greater contributions from their central reservation system  greater name recognition  and greater marketing and financial resources 
new hotels are continually being constructed and opened  in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms 
there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
we are subject to the risks of hotel operations 
we are subject to the risk of fluctuating hotel operating expenses at our hotels  including but not limited to wage and benefit costs  repair and maintenance expenses  gas and electricity costs  insurance costs  including health  general liability and workers compensation  and other operating expenses 
increases in operating expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our revenues are significantly influenced by economic conditions in the midwest 
our hotels are located primarily in the states of illinois  ohio  indiana  michigan  and wisconsin 
in  more than two thirds of our hotel revenues were derived from hotels in the midwest 
as a result  our results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent on economic conditions in the midwest where growth may be weaker than that in other regions  and a decline in economic conditions in this region could have a material adverse affect on us 
geopolitical events could adversely affect us 
geopolitical events including terrorist attacks have adversely affected the travel and hospitality industries 
the impact which these terrorist attacks have had  or could have on our business in particular and the united states economy  the global economy and global financial markets in general is indeterminable 
these attacks or the potential for future attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business  our ability to finance our business  our ability to insure our properties 
the seasonal nature of the lodging industry may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate significantly 
travel and leisure spending in the lodging industry is seasonal in nature 
our hotel revenues are generally greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
similarly  both hotel sales and construction activity are also seasonal 
thus  our quarterly revenues and earnings vary from quarter to quarter and may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic and other factors affecting travel 
our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry 
the lodging industry has experienced a difficult period  and operations have generally been declining for the past several years  which has caused declines in our revenue per available room  or revpar  and profit margins 
the decline in the lodging industry has been attributed to a number of factors including a weak economy  and the effect of potential terrorist activity in the united states which have changed the travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers 
it is not clear whether these changes are permanent or whether they will continue to evolve creating new opportunities or difficulties for the industry 
our results of operations may be affected and can change based on the following risks changes in the national  regional and local economic climate changes in business and leisure travel patterns  local market conditions such as an oversupply of hotel rooms or a reduction in lodging demand  the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to our competitors  the performance of the managers of our hotels  and changes in room rates and increases in operation costs due to inflation and other factors 
our expenses may not decrease if our revenue drops 
many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels  such as debt payments  property taxes  insurance  utilities  and employee wages and benefits  are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the property 
because of weak economic conditions over the last several years  particularly in the lodging industry  we have been working with our managers to reduce the operating costs of our hotels 
while we have achieved reductions in some operating costs as a result of these efforts  further cost reductions would be difficult to achieve if operating levels continue to decline 
some of the cost reduction efforts undertaken may eventually need to be reversed even if operations remain at reduced levels 
regardless of these efforts to reduce costs  our expenses will be affected by inflationary increases  and in the case of certain costs  such as wages  benefits and insurance  may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period 
our managers may be unable to offset any such increased expenses with higher room rates 
any of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures could adversely affect the growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties 
other risks it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as some provisions of delaware law  may discourage  delay or prevent third parties from acquiring us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
each of these provisions makes it more difficult for shareholders to obtain control of our board or initiate actions that are opposed by the then current board 
for example  our certificate of incorporation allows for the issuance of undesignated preferred stock  which gives our board the ability to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights and preferences that could impede the success of any attempted change of control 
delaware law also could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
section of the delaware general corporation law may have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board  including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price of our common stock 
cendant has the right to terminate our development agreement upon a change in control of our company  as defined  if  after the change in control  the company or successor company fails to begin construction on a certain specified number of new amerihost inn hotels within a specified period of time 
in addition  the provision which allows for any refunds on development incentive fees  as a result of terminated franchise agreements by the buyers of our amerihost inn hotels within the first months  to be offset against future fees payable by cendant is terminated  and any such refunds would be payable to cendant immediately 
we depend on our key personnel 
our success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel 
we cannot assure you that these key personnel will remain employed by us 
while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we have some cash flow exposure on our long term debt obligations to changes in market interest rates 
we primarily enter into long term debt obligations in connection with the development and financing of hotels 
we maintain a mix of fixed and floating debt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we do not enter into any market risk sensitive investments for trading purposes 
our management believes that fluctuations in interest rates in the near term would not materially affect our consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows as we have limited risks related to interest rate fluctuations 
the table below provides information about financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  for each interest rate sensitive asset or liability as of december  as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
moreover  the information presented therein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during future periods  hedging strategies and prevailing interest rates at the time 
average nominal carrying value interest rate operating line of credit variable rate  mortgage debt fixed rate  mortgage debt variable rate  if market rates of interest on our variable debt increased by  the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be approximately  annually
