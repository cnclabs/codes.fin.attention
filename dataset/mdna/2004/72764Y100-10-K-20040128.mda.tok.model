item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition dollars in thousands  except per share amounts overview we enhance the learning process by providing computer based and e learning instruction software and related services  offering basic to advanced level courseware in reading  writing  math  science  social studies and life and job skills 
our plato learning system and plato web learning network provide more than  hours of objective based  problem solving courseware and include assessment  alignment and management tools to create standards based curricula and facilitate the learning process 
plato courseware is delivered via networks  cd rom  private intranets and the internet 
in addition  single topic plato courseware is available through our e commerce web site and distributors 
we market our courseware products and services primarily to k schools 
we also sell to colleges  job training programs  correctional institutions  military education programs  corporations and individuals 
in november  we acquired lightspan  inc lightspan following approval by plato and lightspan shareholders 
lightspan is a provider of curriculum based educational software and on line assessment products and services that increase student achievement and enhance teacher professional development 
these products are used in schools and homes and align all key federal reform initiatives  offering school districts a comprehensive achievement and accountability system to assess  align  instruct and evaluate 
this acquisition is expected to strengthen our product offerings  with two strong and complimentary brands  in the k and post secondary markets 
we also expect this acquisition to enhance our ability to provide comprehensive solutions to k and adult learning institutions 
the combination of lightspan and plato also unites lightspan s academic systems products with our community college products to establish the largest provider of on line content for under prepared college students 
in addition  the merger of sales forces will provide critical mass for servicing elementary  secondary  district level  and colleges across all product lines and services 
we believe these advantages  plus the elimination of significant duplicate costs  will provide greater earnings and cash flow potential for the combined company  and ultimately greater valuation 
lightspan generated revenues of  in its fiscal year ended january  we expect to achieve approximately million of cost reductions in and annualized cost reductions of between and million thereafter  primarily through workforce reductions and the elimination of duplicate costs 
the acquisition is expected to be modestly dilutive to our earnings per share in  particularly in the earlier quarters of the year 
earnings per share will be impacted by non cash charges for the amortization of identified intangible assets acquired with this transaction 
the acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings in excluding these charges  and is expected to be accretive to reported earnings in in december  we acquired new media holdings limited new media  a united kingdom uk based publisher of curriculum focused software primarily for teaching secondary school science and math 
this acquisition enhances our science offering  provides a science simulation development capability that we did not previously have and will allow us to introduce new media s products to markets in the united states for the first time 
additionally  this acquisition is expected to provide critical mass and revenue diversification in the uk and strengthen our relationships with the uk education department 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  dependence on information technology spending by our customers  well established competitors  customers dependent on government funding  fluctuations of our quarterly results  a lengthy and variable sales cycle  dependence on key personnel  dependence on our intellectual property rights  rapid technological change and our ability to integrate acquisitions 
as provided for in the private securities litigation reform act of  we caution investors that these factors could cause our future results of operations to vary from those anticipated in previously made forward looking statements and any other forward looking statements made in this document and elsewhere by or on behalf of us 

table of contents our fiscal year is from november to october unless otherwise stated  references to the years  and relate to the fiscal years ended october    and  respectively 
references to future years also relate to our fiscal year ending october critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and have identified revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized product development costs  the valuation of our deferred income taxes  and the valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and identified intangible assets as the critical accounting policies that are significant to the financial statement presentation and require difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these and other accounting policies and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectibility can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable 
in addition  our transactions often consist of multiple element arrangements  which must be analyzed to determine the relative fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended and modified  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we license software under non cancelable license and subscription agreements 
we also provide related professional services  including consulting  training and implementation services  as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
consulting  training and implementation services are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
accordingly  revenues from these services are recognized separately 
revenue from the sale of courseware licenses is recognized upon meeting the following criteria i a written customer order has been executed  ii courseware has been delivered  iii the license fee is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility of the fee is probable 
for software arrangements that include more than one element  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the relative fair value of each deliverable 
vsoe is determined using the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for software arrangements in which we do not have vsoe for undelivered elements  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when vsoe is determined for the undelivered elements or when all elements for which we do not have vsoe have been delivered 
if collectibility of the fee is not probable  revenue is recognized as payments are received from the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as the payments become due provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
subscription revenue  primarily fees charged for our plato web learning network and plato orion products  is recognized on a ratable basis as the products are delivered over the subscription period 

table of contents services revenue consists of software support and maintenance  which is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period  and consulting  training and implementation services  which are recognized as the services are performed 
other revenue  primarily from hardware and third party software products  is recognized as the products are delivered and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
allowance for doubtful accounts we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectibility of specific accounts  historical experience and the aging of the trade and installment accounts receivable 
bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
the assumptions and estimates used to determine the allowance are subject to constant revision and involve significant assumptions and judgment 
the primary factors that impact these assumptions include the efficiency and effectiveness of our billing and collection functions  our historical experience and our credit assessment process 
we believe that the current budget difficulties facing many states will not have a significant impact on the collection of our accounts receivable 
however  a change in the underlying conditions contributing to our belief could impact our assessment of collectibility and  therefore  require a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts and the amount of bad debt expense 
actual collection results could differ materially from those estimated and have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations 
in  we recorded bad debt expense equal to of total revenues  as compared to in our provision is based on our historical experience using a detailed analysis of customer specific activity and receivable balances performed on a quarterly basis 
our allowance for doubtful accounts increased to  or of gross accounts receivable  at october   from  or  at october  capitalized product development costs our product development costs relate to the research  development  enhancement and maintenance of our courseware products 
the amortization of capitalized product development costs is included in cost of revenues 
research and development costs  relating principally to the design and development of new products  and the routine enhancement and maintenance of existing products are expensed as incurred 
we capitalize product development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility 
the majority of our product development costs qualify for capitalization due to the concentration of our development efforts on the content of our courseware 
capitalization ends when a product is available for general release to our customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
we amortize these costs using the greater of a the amount determined by the ratio of the product s current revenue to total expected future revenue  or b the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the product  which is generally three years 
during all periods presented  we used the straight line method to amortize the capitalized costs as this method resulted in greater amortization 
the significant judgment regarding capitalization of product development costs involves the recoverability of capitalized costs 
we continually evaluate our capitalized costs to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product 
estimating net realizable value requires us to estimate future revenues and cash flows to be generated by the product and to use judgment in quantifying the amount  if any  to be written off 
actual cash flows and amounts realized from the courseware products could differ materially from those estimated 
in addition  any future changes to our courseware product offerings could result in write offs of previously capitalized costs and have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations 
valuation of deferred income taxes we account for deferred income taxes based upon differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
the measurement of deferred taxes is adjusted by a valuation allowance  if necessary  to recognize the extent to which the future tax benefits will be recognized 

table of contents at october   we had a net deferred tax asset of  approximately  of the deferred tax asset relates to our net operating loss carryforward in the united states of approximately  which expire in varying amounts between and we also have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  related to our foreign subsidiaries 
we have provided a full valuation allowance related to these foreign deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty in realization of future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions 
realization of our deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the united states prior to expiration of these loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured at october   we believe it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we base this belief upon the levels of taxable income generated historically  as well as projections of future taxable income 
if future levels of taxable income in the united states are not consistent with our expectations  we may be required to record a valuation allowance for the entire deferred tax asset  which would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  we acquired lightspan  an entity that had accumulated significant operating losses during its history 
this merger may change the outlook of recovering our deferred tax assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  we will record the merger transaction in our quarter ending january  and will assess and weigh all available evidence  including the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income  in determining whether or not a valuation allowance is needed 
we have reflected a full valuation allowance in our form k a filed january  relating to this acquisition  as this is presently the more likely outcome 
assuming we determine that a valuation allowance is necessary  our pre acquisition deferred tax assets would be fully reserved through purchase accounting  and our future consolidated statements of operations will likely not reflect a normal tax provision or benefit 
income tax expense in this scenario would still be required to the extent we utilize fully reserved deferred tax assets that existed at the date of the lightspan acquisition 
additionally  income tax expense is expected in the amount of approximately per year relating to tax deductible goodwill even with losses in the united states 
the valuation allowance  if any  will exclude the deferred tax liability relating to tax deductible goodwill  which cannot be used to support realization of the other net deferred tax assets 
goodwill and identified intangible assets we record our acquisitions in accordance with sfas we allocate the cost of acquired companies to the tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  while in process research and development  if any  is recorded as a one time charge at the acquisition date 
most of the companies we acquire do not have significant tangible assets and  as a result  the majority of the purchase price is typically allocated to identified intangible assets and or goodwill  which increases future amortization expense of identified intangible assets and the potential for impairment charges that we may incur 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets may have a significant impact on our future operating results 
in addition  the allocation of the purchase price requires that we make significant assumptions and estimates  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
should different conditions prevail  we may have to record impairment charges  which may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to expense and must be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we operate as one 
table of contents reporting unit and therefore compare our book value to market value market capitalization plus a control premium 
if our fair value exceeds our book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if our book value exceeds our market value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
we completed an initial goodwill impairment assessment as of november  to determine if a transition impairment charge should be recognized under sfas upon assessment  no transition impairment charge was recorded 
we also completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of october  and  upon which no impairment charge was recorded 
acquisitions our acquisition strategy is to acquire complementary products or businesses that will enable us to achieve our strategic goals  including market leadership  growth rates that exceed the market  and providing innovative  leading and distinct products and services 
since  and as of october   we have made the following acquisitions purchase company date reason price cybered  inc july science products  wasatch interactive learning corporation april elementary products  teachmaster technologies  inc september standards based products and services  netschools corporation may web based curriculum and instructional management delivery platform  learningelements  inc august elementary reading products  the revenue contribution from these acquisitions is discussed in more detail below refer to the revenue section in results of operations 
as of october   all of these acquisitions are fully integrated into our operations 
subsequent to october   as mentioned earlier  we acquired lightspan  inc and new media holdings limited 
lightspan was acquired in a stock transaction where we issued approximately million shares of our common stock  valued at approximately  for all of lightspan s outstanding stock 
we acquired new media for approximately  in cash 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
reclassification of financial information we continue to increase our focus on services and subscription based products  rather than primarily on perpetual software licenses 
in order to provide more meaningful disclosures  we will now present our revenues and cost of revenues in four categories license fees  subscriptions  services and other 
in addition  with the goal of providing more detail and greater understanding of our operating results  we have made certain other reclassifications 
sales and marketing expenses are now presented separately from general and administrative expenses 
previously  these expenses were presented together as selling  general and administrative expenses 
also  certain costs previously reported as an element of operating expenses have been reclassified to cost of

as of october   no additional consideration has been earned 
interest rate risk our borrowing capacity primarily consists of a revolving loan with interest rates that fluctuate based upon the prime rate and libor market indexes 
at october   we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
table of contents under this revolving credit facility 
our only debt consisted of capital lease obligations at fixed interest rates 
as a result  risk relating to interest fluctuation is considered minimal 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we market our products and services worldwide and have operations in canada and the united kingdom
