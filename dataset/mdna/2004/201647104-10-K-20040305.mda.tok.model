with the expansion and strengthening of the bank s customer relationships  the potential for growth in net interest and fee income will be enhanced 
the corporation s operations are also continually reviewed in order to gain efficiencies  enhance productivity and minimize costs 
net income for the year ended december   was million  or per diluted share compared to net income for the year ended december  of million  or per diluted share 
results for were significantly affected by an unprecedented interest rate environment primarily driven by the federal reserve s reductions of the targeted federal funds interest rate down to one percent  the lowest level in over years 
this low interest rate environment negatively impacted the entire industry 
the resulting compression in the corporation s net interest margin was accentuated by record levels of prepayments on higher yielding loans 
table of contents and mortgage backed securities 
furthermore  increased amortization of net deferred loan costs and premiums on loans and mortgage backed securities  which are fully amortized against interest income when a loan pays off  magnified the compression to net interest margin 
the higher loan prepayments also caused a considerable increase in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights  although the stabilization and slight increase in interest rates toward the end of allowed the corporation to record net recoveries in its mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance for the low interest rate environment also resulted in record levels of residential mortgage loan production and refinancing activity as consumers took advantage of lower interest rates to refinance existing loans or originate new mortgage loans 
the significantly higher levels of loan prepayments contributed to an increase in corresponding expenses for during  the corporation sold available for sale securities which resulted in the recognition of net gains to strategically offset continued high levels of amortization of mortgage servicing rights  accelerated amortization of net deferred costs and premiums on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  and losses recognized on the termination of certain swap agreements 
the corporation also sold available for sale securities during the year that resulted in net losses to strategically offset net recoveries in the valuation allowance of mortgage servicing rights 
gains on sales of loans decreased in compared to as production volumes for residential mortgages held for sale slowed during the latter part of and pricing spreads began to shrink in response to changing competitive market factors 
gains on sales of loans are expected to decline further during due to lower expected mortgage production volumes and competitive market conditions 
the corporation s credit quality saw additional improvement in which is indicative of the corporation s diligence in credit underwriting and monitoring procedures  as well as the corporation s focus on identifying and limiting credit concentrations 
the positive trends in credit quality also reflect the general stability of the economy in the midwestern markets where the corporation operates 
the corporation does not foresee any significant asset quality issues in during the second half of  the corporation strategically reduced the size of its balance sheet as part of a plan to decrease certain residential mortgage loan and available for sale securities portfolios that were lower margin contributors to net interest income 
in addition to decreasing lower yielding assets  a portion of the advances from the fhlb was paid down 
as a related part of this strategy  the corporation sold certain available for sale securities resulting in net gains realized to partially offset the recognition of a million loss on the termination of certain interest rate swap agreements that were previously hedging the fhlb debt that was paid down 
the corporation also executed fhlb debt restructuring strategies in the fourth quarter of that have begun to favorably impact net interest margin 
the reduction in the size of the balance sheet also resulted in a decrease to required levels of regulatory capital allowing management to continue repurchasing approximately million shares of the corporation s common stock in although the future interest rate environment is uncertain  management anticipates that market interest rates in will remain near the same level of interest rates in effect toward the end of this projected stability in interest rates coupled with the restructuring of the corporation s balance sheet and fhlb debt that occurred in  is expected to improve net interest margin performance for on march   the corporation filed with the sec amended forms q for the three calendar quarters ended september   and an amended form k for the year ended december  these amendments restated the corporation s consolidated financial statements correcting an error in accounting for certain components of a bank owned life insurance boli policy 
as a result of management s review of this boli policy s terms in conjunction with the restatement of the corporation s consolidated financial statements  management signed an amendment to this boli policy effective february  that will result in the recognition of an asset and an increase in net income of approximately million or approximately 
per diluted share for the first quarter ending march  the amendment will allow the corporation to receive a guaranteed payment of a certain component of the boli policy if there is a full and complete surrender of all outstanding certificates of the boli 
net income for the year ended december   was million  or per diluted share 
net income for includes pre tax gains on the sales of available for sale securities totaling million and 
table of contents mortgage loans totaling million 
these net gains were substantially offset by the valuation adjustment losses totaling million in the mortgage servicing rights portfolio incurred during the gains on the sales of mortgage loans were the result of the corporation taking advantage of pricing opportunities on its loans resulting from historically low interest rates and unprecedented loan demand during these low interest rates in significantly affected mortgage loan pay downs which in turn increased the amortization expense of mortgage servicing rights and impacted the valuation allowances for impairment losses of mortgage servicing rights 
critical accounting policies the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and disclosures included within this form k annual report  are based on the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used  including the adequacy of allowances for loan losses  valuation of mortgage servicing rights and contingencies 
estimates are based upon historical experience  current economic conditions and other factors that management considers reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates result in judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities where these values are not readily available from other sources as well as assessing and identifying the accounting treatments of commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two elements 
the first element is an allocated allowance established for specifically identified loans that are evaluated individually for impairment 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest  when due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment is measured by i the present value of expected future cash flows  ii the loan s obtainable market price  or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent the primary method used by the corporation 
the second element is an estimated allowance established for impairment on each of the corporation s pools of outstanding loans 
see provision for loan losses in the md a and asset quality under item of this report for additional information 
these estimated allowances are based on several analysis factors including the corporation s past loss experience  economic and business conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  geographic and industry concentrations  composition of the loan portfolio  credit quality and delinquency trends  regular examinations of specific problem loans by the corporation s credit review team  the overall portfolio quality and real estate market conditions in the corporation s lending areas  and known and inherent risks in each of the portfolios 
these evaluations are inherently subjective because  while they are based on objective data delinquency trends  portfolio composition  loan grading and other data  it is the interpretation of that data by management that ultimately determines the estimate of the appropriate allowance 
due to the interplay of the variety of factors that impact the estimated allowance for loan losses  a significant change in a single factor generally does not result in a significant change in the overall required level of the allowance for loan losses 
additionally  while the allowance attempts to measure the impairment inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date  its adequacy will ultimately be dependent upon how conditions existing at the balance sheet date impact the loans in the future 
consequently  these estimates require revisions as new or changed information becomes available 
a majority of the corporation s loans are collateralized by residential or commercial real estate 
therefore  the collectibility of such loans is susceptible to changes in prevailing real estate market conditions and other 
table of contents factors  which can cause the fair value of the collateral to decline below the loan balance 
if it becomes necessary to initiate foreclosure on real estate collateralizing a loan  a new appraisal is obtained to determine if the market value of the underlying collateral has declined to justify a charge off of the loan 
recoveries of loan charge offs occur when loan payments are received on the deficient loan in excess of the remaining recorded book balance of the loan 
upon foreclosure and conversion of the loan into real estate owned  the corporation may realize income through the disposition of such real estate when the sale proceeds exceed the carrying value of the real estate 
although management believes that the corporation s allowance for loan losses is adequate to reflect the risk inherent in its loan portfolios  there can be no assurance that the corporation will not experience increases in its nonperforming assets  that it will not increase the level of its allowances in the future or that significant provisions for loan losses will not be required based on factors such as deterioration in market conditions  changes in borrowers financial conditions  delinquencies and defaults 
in addition  regulatory agencies review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a regular basis as an integral part of their examination process 
such agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights are established based on the cost of acquiring the right to service mortgage loans or the allocated fair value of servicing rights retained on loans originated by the bank and subsequently sold in the secondary market 
these costs are initially capitalized and then amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing revenues 
projected net servicing revenues are determined on the basis of the estimated future balance of the underlying mortgage loan portfolio which decreases over time from scheduled loan amortization and prepayments 
future prepayment rates are estimated based on third party sources and relevant characteristics of the servicing portfolio  such as loan types  interest rate stratification and recent prepayment experience  as well as current interest rate levels  market forecasts and other economic conditions 
the corporation reports mortgage servicing rights at the lower of amortized cost or fair value 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined using the present value of estimated future cash flow techniques  incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of values 
mortgage servicing rights are assessed for impairment periodically  based on fair value  with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and permanent impairment  if any  recognized through a write off of the mortgage servicing rights asset and the related valuation allowance 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the rights are stratified based on loan type and note rate 
loan types include government  conventional and adjustable rate mortgage loans 
impairment losses are recognized to the extent the unamortized carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights for each stratum exceeds the current fair value of that stratum 
a valuation adjustment recovery for previously recognized temporary impairment losses totaling million was recorded during the year ended december   compared to valuation adjustment losses totaling million and million  respectively  recorded during the years ended december  and valuation allowances totaling million  million and million  respectively  were outstanding at december   and the carrying value of mortgage servicing rights  net of the valuation allowance  totaled million at december   compared to million and million  respectively  at december  and as part of its overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of interest rates adversely affecting the value of mortgage servicing rights  the corporation uses interest rate floor agreements to protect the value of the mortgage servicing rights 
additionally  the corporation partially offsets recorded changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights through the recognition of gains on the sales of available for sale securities 
the determination of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is an important estimate 
since mortgage servicing rights are not quoted in an active market  the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is estimated using a software model which is calibrated against variables affecting the value of this asset  including prepayment speeds  discount rates  servicing costs and market liquidity 
management uses third party estimates of 
table of contents prepayment speeds and maintains relationships with servicing brokers to keep abreast of any market developments which may impact the value of this asset 
on a periodic basis  management of the corporation obtains an independent valuation report for comparison to the valuation results of the software model 
see note mortgage banking activities for a sensitivity analysis of how changes in prepayment speeds and discount rates affect the fair value of mortgage servicing rights 
derivative financial instruments derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial condition and measured at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction referred to as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
for a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability referred to as a fair value hedge  any gain or loss associated with the derivative is reported in earnings along with the change in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
on the date the corporation enters into a derivative contract  management must designate the derivative as a hedge of the identified cash flow exposure  fair value exposure or as a no hedging derivative 
proper documentation is a critical aspect pursuant to hedge accounting treatment 
the corporation formally documents all relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
in this documentation  the corporation specifically identifies the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and states how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
the corporation formally measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with its risk management policy 
the methods used to measure effectiveness vary depending on the hedging relationship  however  the method chosen at the inception of each hedge is not subsequently changed 
the fair value of the corporation s derivatives is determined using various methods depending on the nature of the derivatives such as quotes obtained from independent pricing services  valuation models of independent pricing services with known factors put into the model  or software models utilizing assumptions or data obtained from independent sources 
segment reporting operating results by segment the corporation s operations are aligned into four lines of business for management reporting purposes 
these lines of business units are commercial banking  retail banking  mortgage banking and treasury 
see note segment information for additional information on the corporation s lines of business including tabular results of operations for the years ended december   and the financial information presented does not necessarily represent the business unit s results of operations or financial condition as if they were independent companies 
results of operations for each business unit are derived from management s internal reporting system used to measure the performance of the segments and the corporation in total 
this management reporting system and the results of operations and financial condition by reported business unit may not be in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
commercial banking the commercial banking segment involves the origination of commercial operating loans  commercial real estate loans  commercial and residential construction loans  indirect lending loans  agricultural loans and small 
table of contents business loans 
also included in this segment are commercial demand deposits  time deposits and cash management products and services 
the commercial banking segment reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   net interest income for the segment increased million compared to the year ended december  this increase in net interest income is due primarily to a million increase in the average balance of the commercial loan portfolio during over the portfolio increase is due to the successful sales efforts of commercial lenders and the development of cash management products to meet client needs 
additionally  the segment was fully staffed for as a result of the growth emphasis and strategic direction of the segment  with specific focus on upgrading the regional management positions 
the provision for loan losses decreased million for compared to the primary reason for the decrease was a reduction in the expected loss rate applied to the segment s loans 
total other income decreased million in this decrease is primarily due to the treasury segment charging the commercial banking segment a break funding fee totaling million relating to commercial real estate loans paying off in full prior to maturity 
this intersegment charge was implemented in offsetting this charge is an increase in other income from cash management services  which increased million in total other expense increased million for compared to primarily due to an million reclassification of commercial deposits cost entirely to the commercial segment for  while the segment was only allocated of the cost in  increased production incentive bonuses and more full time equivalent employees during compared to for the year ended december   net interest income increased million compared to this increase in net interest income was due primarily to the million increase in the average balance of the commercial loan portfolio during over the provision for loan losses increased million due to the larger commercial loan portfolio and a higher anticipated loss percentage compared to total other income decreased million for compared to total other expense decreased million for compared to the primary reason was the allocation of of the cost for commercial deposits to the retail banking segment totaling million in this reduction was offset by the allocated portion of the net gain from exit costs and termination benefits totaling million during in addition  the corporation recorded an impairment loss totaling million on a residential master planned community development located in nevada during retail banking the retail banking segment involves a variety of traditional banking and financial services including the origination of residential mortgage loans through the bank s branch network and the sale of these mortgage loans to the treasury segment or the mortgage banking segment 
in addition  servicing rights to mortgage loans are sold to the mortgage banking segment 
other core retail banking services include consumer checking  savings and certificates of deposit accounts regular and retirement  consumer loans for home equity  autos  secured and unsecured purposes  as well as credit cards  and other ancillary retail banking services including overdraft protection  electronic and telephone bill paying and cash advances 
also included in this segment are insurance and securities brokerage services 
the retail banking segment reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and net interest income decreased million for compared to this decrease in net interest income is primarily due to a lower transfer pricing spread on consumer deposits 
the spread for calendar year was compared to for the provision for loan losses decreased million for compared to due to a reduction in the expected loss rate applied to the segment s home equity loans 
total other income increased million from intersegment fees received for the origination of mortgage servicing for compared to primarily due to the million increase in mortgage loan volume 
this increase was 
table of contents offset by a million decrease in credit life insurance income due to a change in federal regulations limiting premiums on loans 
the potential growth for debit card interchange fees during was limited by a third party settlement with visa  inc  which occurred during the year 
in addition  reimbursed loan fees collected were reclassified from other income in to other expense in these fees totaled million in total other expense decreased million for compared to the primary reasons for this decrease were the million reclassification of costs associated with commercial deposits being allocated entirely to the commercial banking segment for  while the segment was charged of this cost in  reimbursed loan fees reclassified from other income in to other expense in totaling million and a  decrease in title search fees due to the segment switching to the use of third party title insurance in for home equity loans 
in addition  there was a  decrease in fraud losses compared to  as well as a  decrease in item processing costs in due to less paper items processed for checking accounts 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million in compensation primarily due to increased staffing in the branches over the summer and incentives paid on higher production volumes  a million increase in advertising cost for the bank s promotion to provide cash back on debit card activity and a million increase in facilities expense due to additional maintenance costs incurred to improve the appearance of certain branches 
for the year ended december  compared to  net interest income decreased million 
this decrease in net interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates on consumer loans comparing to the provision for loan losses increased million due to the increase in the retail banking segment s home equity portfolio 
total other income increased million for compared to due to the increased retail fee pricing structure  which was effective september  this increase was offset by decreases in commission revenues from brokerage operations due to lower transaction volumes 
total other expense increased million for compared to due to the allocation of of the cost for commercial deposits to the retail banking segment totaling million in in addition  the segment received an allocated portion of the net gain from exit costs and termination benefits totaling million during mortgage banking the mortgage banking segment involves the acquisition of a portion of correspondent  brokered and originated residential mortgage loans  the sale of these mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market and to the treasury segment  the purchase  sale and origination of rights to service mortgage loans  and the servicing of mortgage loans for the treasury segment and outside investors 
the mortgage banking segment reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and for  net interest income increased million compared to this increase in net interest income comparing the respective years is primarily due to increases in custodial cash earnings that were credited using an internal cost of funds rate and higher warehouse loan balances 
the custodial cash earnings increased due to increases in escrow balances primarily from the higher volume of mortgage refinancing activity and the increase in the average escrow balance resulting from the purchase of bulk loan servicing totaling billion during the latter half of total other income decreased million for primarily due to an increase of million in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights in this was due to the payoff of billion in principal balances in the loan servicing portfolio and a million intersegment charge for impairment of mortgage servicing rights on originated loans and purchased servicing 
also  a decrease of million on the net gains on sales of warehouse loans was due to the competitive interest rate market conditions in total other expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to due to increased loan origination costs from mortgage loan originations of million over the activity and increased servicing costs due to mid month loan payoffs  which increased million in over the change in net income for the mortgage banking segment was also significantly affected by a shift from income tax expense of million in to an income tax benefit of million for for the year ended december  compared to  net interest income increased million 
this increase was primarily due to increases in the credit the mortgage banking segment received in compared 
table of contents to from increases in its custodial cash earnings that were credited using an internal cost of funds rate 
the custodial cash earnings increased due to increases in escrow balances primarily from the significant mortgage refinancing activity 
total other income increased million for primarily due to net gains on the sales of warehouse loans partially offset by an increase in amortization of mortgage servicing rights in over total other expense increased million for compared to primarily due to the allocated portion of the net gain from exit costs and termination benefits totaling million during treasury the treasury segment is responsible for managing corporate interest rate risk through asset and liability management strategies 
the treasury segment manages the corporation s investments in single family residential mortgage loans  mortgage servicing rights  investment and mortgage backed securities  and certain funding sources including wholesale deposits  advances from the federal home loan bank and all other borrowings 
the treasury segment reported net income of million for year ended december   compared to net income of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and net interest income decreased million for compared to due primarily to the lower yields earned on the treasury segment s total interest earning assets portfolio and a reduction in the average size of the portfolio comparing to the provision for loan losses decreased million for compared to due primarily to an overall reduction in the expected loss rate applied to the segment s loans 
total other income increased million for primarily as a result of the credit relating to the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights totaling million  intersegment loan prepayment fees totaling million generated from the commercial banking segment which was implemented in and the intersegment revenue totaling million in from the mortgage banking and retail banking segments also implemented in from the impairment of mortgage servicing rights purchased during these increases to total other income were partially offset by decreases in net gains and losses on sales of securities and changes in fair values of derivatives totaling million compared to total other expense for is a net credit balance of  compared to expense of million for due to the increase in deferred expense from mortgage loan originations 
the change in net income for the treasury segment was also impacted by a shift from an income tax benefit of million in to an income tax expense of million for for the year ended december  compared to  net interest income decreased million due primarily to the higher average balances of investment and mortgage backed securities for compared to with lower yields in  and to higher average balances of borrowed funds partially offset by lower rates in over the provision for loan losses decreased million for compared to due to a better allocation of the overall bank risk to the retail banking and commercial banking segments 
for  total other income was a loss of million compared to a loss of million for this increase in the loss recorded in other income is due primarily to valuation adjustments for impairment of mortgage servicing rights totaling million recorded in compared to million recorded in total other expense for is million compared to million for this net change is primarily due to the allocated portion of the net gain from exit costs and termination benefits totaling million during consolidated results of operations comparison of consolidated results of operations net income for the year ended december   was million or per diluted share per basic share  compared to net income of million or per diluted share per basic share  for the year ended december   and net income of million  or per diluted shared per basic share for the year ended december  the decrease in net income comparing to is primarily due to a decrease of million in net interest income caused by margin compression as interest rates reached 
table of contents historically low levels during in turn  higher volumes of prepayments on higher yielding mortgage and consumer home equity loans and mortgage backed securities during the year repriced much of the asset base to a lower overall yield  while deposit costs had minimal capacity for further downward repricing during in addition to the reduction of interest income on higher yielding assets  increases in the amortization levels of net deferred loan costs and premiums on loans and mortgage backed securities  which are fully amortized against interest income when a loan pays off  further magnified the compression to net interest margin 
the results were also impacted by an increase of million in general and administrative expenses primarily related to higher loan production costs as consumers took advantage of lower interest rates to refinance or originate mortgage loans 
partially offsetting these decreases to net income was an increase of million in total other income primarily due to recording a mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustment recovery of million for  compared to a valuation adjustment loss of million for  relating to an increase in market interest rates that occurred during the latter part of this mortgage servicing rights valuation recovery was offset by higher amortization of mortgage servicing rights which increased to million for compared to million for the increase in mortgage servicing rights amortization was caused by the significantly higher levels of mortgage loan prepayments which occurred during net gains on the sales of loans decreased to million in compared to million in primarily as a result of a reduction in the volume of loans held for sale and smaller pricing spreads during the latter part of as interest rates began to stabilize 
these fluctuations in non interest income related to mortgage servicing rights and gains on sales of loans were partially offset by net gains on the sales of available for sale securities and changes in the fair value of derivatives of million in compared to net gains of million for another favorable increase impacting pre tax income compared to was a decrease of million in the provision for loan losses reflecting the strength of the corporation s credit quality 
the increase in net income for over is primarily due to an increase of million in net interest income and decreases of million in the amortization of intangible assets and million in the provision for loan losses 
the favorable increase in net interest income reflects the impact of the declining interest rate environment during which time interest bearing liabilities were repricing downward faster than interest earning assets and a shift was occurring in the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the million decrease in the amortization of intangible assets relates to the change in the accounting treatment for goodwill which was effective january  while the million improvement in the provision for loan losses reflects the improvement in asset quality which occurred during these increases to net income were partially offset by an increase of million in general and administrative expenses primarily resulting from a net gain for exit costs and termination benefits of million which reduced expenses in and an increase of million in compensation and benefits expense in net income for includes pre tax gains on the sales of available for sale securities totaling million and mortgage loans totaling million  compared to respective net gains of million and million for loan servicing fees  net of amortization expense on mortgage servicing rights  totaled million for compared to million for the decrease in these loan servicing fees resulted from the lower interest rates in which also effected the valuation allowances for impairment losses of mortgage servicing rights 
valuation adjustment losses totaling million in the mortgage servicing rights portfolio were recorded during compared to million for the valuation adjustments are due to increases in loan prepayment speeds resulting from rapidly declining interest rates 
net interest income net interest income for the year ended december   totaled million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  and compared to million for the year ended december  during  and  the net interest rate spreads inclusive of non interest bearing deposits were  and  respectively  a decrease of basis points comparing and  and an increase of basis points comparing to the net yield on interest earning assets was for compared to and  respectively  for and  a decrease of basis points comparing to and an increase of basis points comparing to 
table of contents the decreases in the interest rate spread and the net yield earned on interest earning assets comparing to were due primarily to an basis point decrease in the yield earned on interest earning assets resulting from historically low market interest rates driven by the federal reserve s reduction of the targeted federal funds rate to the lowest level in over years 
earning assets contractually repriced downward during and higher yielding assets were replaced with lower yielding assets as the corporation s customers took advantage of the historically low interest rates to originate or refinance loans 
the decrease in yield was further magnified by the acceleration of amortization of net deferred costs and premiums on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  which are fully amortized against interest income when a loan or mortgage backed security pays off 
the decrease in yield for interest earning assets was partially offset by a basis point decline in the rate incurred on total deposits and interest bearing liabilities 
this decrease was also due to the downward repricing of interest bearing liabilities in response to lower market interest rates  but at a slower rate than the repricing of interest earning assets 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities reflects the effects of certain derivative positions  which have effectively locked in long term fixed rates of interest  that are now at higher costs than current market interest rates 
see the following section entitled asset liability management of this management discussion and analysis and note derivative financial instruments for a discussion of the corporation s use of derivative financial instruments in managing its interest rate risk 
management anticipates that the corporation s interest rate spread and net yield on interest earning assets will gradually increase during this anticipated increase is due to the corporation s decision to strategically reduce the size of its balance sheet during the latter half of to decrease certain residential mortgage loan and available for sale securities portfolios that were lower margin contributors to net interest income along with a corresponding decrease in higher costing fhlb advances 
additionally  during the latter half of  the corporation executed other debt restructuring and derivative strategies that have started to favorably impact net interest income 
as the corporation continues to change the mix of the loan portfolio to carry a greater share of higher yielding commercial operating and consumer loans  and continues to focus on growth in lower costing core deposits  management anticipates that net interest income will further experience favorable increases as a result of these objectives 
future trends in interest rate spreads and net interest income will be dependent upon and influenced by changes in and levels of and the interplay among short term and long term market interest rates  loan prepayment volumes  the composition and size of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rate risk exposure of the corporation and the maturity and repricing activity of interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
net interest income increased million for compared to due to i the lower interest rate environment in which costing liabilities were repricing downward at a faster rate than earning assets were repricing  ii the continued shift in the asset mix toward higher yielding commercial and consumer loans and iii a shift in funding from certificates of deposit primarily to fhlb advances and to checking accounts and money market accounts in the latter part of the increase in the interest rate spread comparing to was due primarily to a basis point decrease in the rate incurred on total deposits and interest bearing liabilities partially offset by a basis point decline in the yield received on interest earning assets 
total interest expense decreased million comparing the year ended december   to december   primarily due to lower market interest rates 
at the same time  comparing to  the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million  primarily due to increases in fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaling million and million  respectively  partially offset by a decrease of million in certificates of deposit 
total interest income decreased million comparing to due to the lower yields on interest earning assets  even though the average balance of interest earning assets increased million over the same time periods

table of contents asset liability management the net interest income of the corporation is subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference  or mismatch  between the amount of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which mature or reprice in specified periods 
when interest rates change  to the extent the corporation s interest earning assets have longer maturities or effective repricing periods than its interest bearing liabilities  the interest income realized on the corporation s interest earning assets will adjust more slowly than the interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities 
this mismatch in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities is commonly referred to as the gap 
a gap is considered positive when the interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a specified period exceed the interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period 
a gap is considered negative when the interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a specified period exceed the interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would result in an increase to net interest income 
similarly  during a period of declining interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income 
the corporation generally invests in interest earning assets that reprice more slowly than its interest bearing liabilities 
this mismatch exposes the corporation to interest rate risk 
in a rising rate environment  interest bearing liabilities will reprice faster than interest earning assets  thereby decreasing net interest income 
the corporation seeks to control its exposure to interest rate risk by emphasizing shorter term assets such as commercial and consumer loans 
in addition  the corporation utilizes longer term advances from the fhlb to extend the repricing characteristics of its interest bearing liabilities 
the corporation also enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to lengthen synthetically its short term debt obligations 
in connection with its asset liability management program  the corporation has interest rate swap agreements with other counterparties under terms that provide for an exchange of interest payments on the outstanding notional amount of the swap agreement 
these agreements are primarily used to synthetically lengthen the maturity of certain deposit liabilities and fhlb advances 
in accordance with these arrangements the corporation pays fixed rates and receives variable rates of interest  or receives fixed rates and pays variable rates  according to a specified index 
the corporation had swap agreements to pay fixed and receive variable rates of interest with notional principal amounts of billion at december   compared to billion and billion  respectively at december  and the corporation also had a swap agreement to receive fixed and pay variable rates of interest with a notional amount of million at december  for the years ended december   and  the corporation recorded million  million and million  respectively  in net interest expense from its interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements outstanding as of december   have maturities ranging from september to march during the second half of  the corporation reduced the size of its balance sheet as part of a strategic plan to reduce available for sale investment and mortgage backed securities that were lower margin contributors to net interest income 
this plan also included paying down a portion of fhlb advance debt 
during the third quarter of  the corporation recognized a million loss on the termination of certain swap agreements that were previously hedging the adjustable interest payments related to the million in adjustable rate fhlb advances that were paid off in connection with this plan 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation restructured billion of convertible fixed rate fhlb advances by extending the maturities beyond their original maturity date and modifying the interest rate terms 
subsequent to the restructure  million of these advances mature each year beyond the original maturity date 
after  the fixed rate on these fhlb advances will be replaced by a floating rate 
the outcome of this transaction was such that both the corporation and the fhlb were in the same fundamental economic position at the conclusion of the restructuring 

table of contents the corporation entered into swaption agreements beginning in to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of the call options embedded in certain fixed rate fhlb advances 
all terms of the swaption agreements exactly match the terms of these fhlb advances 
in the event any of these fhlb advances are called  the corporation will exercise its corresponding option to enter into a swap agreement paying a fixed rate of interest and receiving a variable rate of interest 
in november  the corporation terminated swaption agreements with a notional amount of billion 
these terminations occurred in conjunction with the aforementioned restructuring of terms of fixed rate callable fhlb advances for which the embedded call options were being hedged by these terminated swaption agreements 
see note derivative financial instruments for additional information regarding the corporation s swap and swaption agreements 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation terminated interest rate swap agreements that were previously designated as cash flow hedges of adjustable interest payments related to million in adjustable rate savings deposits 
these terminations occurred as part of management s asset liability strategy to maintain a balanced interest rate risk position after the sale of investments that occurred in conjunction with the restructuring of the corporation s balance sheet during the third quarter of the following table represents management s projected maturity and repricing of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and interest rate swap agreements presented which mature or reprice within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms and expected behavior over time of such assets  liabilities and interest rate swap agreements 
adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities are included in the period in which they are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature 
all loans and mortgage backed securities are adjusted for prepayment rates based on information provided by independent sources as of december   and the bank s historical prepayment experience 
fixed rate savings accounts  checking accounts and non indexed money market accounts are assumed to reprice or mature according to the decay rates defined by regulatory guidelines 
indexed money market accounts are deemed to reprice or mature within the day category 
management believes that these assumptions approximate actual experience and considers such assumptions reasonable  however  the actual interest rate sensitivity of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may vary substantially if actual experience differs from the assumptions used

the corporation s interest rate sensitivity is also monitored through analysis of the change in the net portfolio value npv 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco  comprised of members of senior management  monitors the sensitivity of the value of the balance sheet to changes in market interest rates 
the primary purpose of the asset liability management function is to manage the corporation s combined portfolio such that its capital is leveraged effectively into assets and liabilities which maximize corporate profitability while minimizing exposure to changes in interest rates 
the alco and the board of directors review the interest rate risk position of the bank on a quarterly basis 
several measures are employed to determine the bank s exposure to interest rate risk 
market value sensitivity analysis measures the change in the bank s npv ratio in the event of sudden and sustained changes in market interest rates 
the npv ratio is defined as the market value of the bank s capital divided by the market value of its assets 
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to compare the repricing characteristics of the 
table of contents bank s assets and liabilities 
finally  net interest income sensitivity analysis is used to measure the impact of changing interest rates on corporate earnings 
if estimated changes to the npv ratio and the sensitivity gap are not within the limits established by the board of directors  the board may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within board approved limits 
the corporation s board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes a minimum allowable npv ratio generally over a range of hypothetical interest rates extending from basis points below current levels to basis points above current levels 
in addition  the policy establishes a maximum allowable change in the npv ratio of in the event of an instantaneous and adverse change in interest rates of basis points 
due to the current low interest rates in  the hypothetical changes in interest rates for the basis point decline and the basis point decline were not calculated since using such negative interest rate scenarios would yield meaningless results 
the ots monitors the bank s interest rate risk management procedures under guidelines set forth in thrift bulletin a 
this bulletin requires that the corporation s board of directors set interest rate risk limits that would prohibit the bank from exhibiting a post shock npv ratio and interest rate sensitivity measure of significant risk or high risk  as defined by the ots 
the ots limits generally set a minimum npv ratio of at the basis points rate shock level  and a maximum change in npv ratio of at the same level 
alternately  the ots set a minimum npv ratio of at the basis point rate shock level and a maximum change in the npv ratio of at the same level 
finally  due to the low interest rate environment  ots limits have temporarily been removed from the down basis points and replaced with a down basis points test 
the following table presents the projected change in the bank s npv ratio for various hypothetical rate shock levels as of december  hypothetical change in interest rates market value of capital market value of assets npv ratio minimum board limit change in npv ratio over base scenario board maximum allowable change dollars in thousands basis point rise

n a at december   the bank s npv ratios were within the targets set by the board of directors in all rate scenarios 
in addition  at december   the bank was within the limits set by the ots to maintain a risk rating of minimal risk  the most favorable risk rating 
the npv ratio is calculated by the corporation pursuant to guidelines established by the ots 
the modeling calculation is based on the net present value of discounted estimated cash flows utilizing prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent sources as of december   with adjustments made to reflect the shift in interest rates as appropriate 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
provision for loan losses and asset quality the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuous evaluation of the collectibility of outstanding loans  which takes into consideration such factors as changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and economic conditions that affect the borrower s ability to pay  regular examinations of specific problem loans 
table of contents by the corporation s credit review team  quarterly review discussions of criticized loans  and reviews of the overall portfolio quality and real estate market conditions in the corporation s lending areas 
management of the corporation believes that the present level of allowance for loan losses is adequate to reflect the risks inherent in its portfolios 
however  there can be no assurance that the corporation will not experience increases in its nonperforming assets  that it will not increase the level of its allowance in the future or that significant provisions for losses will not be required based on factors such as deterioration in market conditions  changes in borrowers financial conditions  delinquencies and defaults 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two elements 
the first element is an allocated allowance established for specifically identified loans that are evaluated and are considered to be individually impaired 
the second element is an estimated allowance established for impairment on each of the corporation s pools of outstanding loans 
these estimated allowances are based on several analysis factors including the corporation s past loss experience  general economic and business conditions  geographic and industry concentrations  credit quality and delinquency trends  and known and inherent risks in each of the portfolios 
these evaluations are inherently subjective and require frequent revisions as updated information becomes available 
an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december is as follows in thousands beginning balance provision charged to operations charge offs recoveries other ending balance the corporation recorded loan loss provisions totaling million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses was of loans receivable at december   compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans receivable for the years ended and remained relatively flat due to minimal change in management s assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolios  general economic conditions  and other factors 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans receivable for the year ended was lower compared to due to less risk in the portfolio mix as the focused growth in commercial and consumer lending had not yet begun 
also  the upward trend of net charge offs in compared to impacted the increased level in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans receivable during the decreases in the loan loss provisions for compared to and for compared to are reflective of the changes in the allowance for loan losses relative to the size and the quality of the loan portfolio as well as general economic conditions during those periods 
net loans charged off totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the favorable decrease in compared to was due primarily to decreases in charge offs of commercial real estate loans  commercial operating loans and residential loans totaling million  million and million  respectively  partially offset by an increase in charge offs for consumer loans totaling million 
the primary reason for the decrease in the commercial real estate loan charge offs comparing and  is due to a few large commercial real estate loan charge offs recognized in the corporation s residential mortgage loan portfolio is primarily secured by properties located within its branch market area or in areas where the corporation has broker or correspondent relationships for residential mortgage loan originations 
at december   the residential loan portfolio totaled billion and is secured by properties located primarily in colorado  nebraska  massachusetts  kansas  
table of contents and iowa 
at december   the residential loan portfolio totaled billion and was secured by properties located primarily in colorado and nebraska 
there are no significant credit risk concerns related to the economic conditions in the states where these residential properties securing the corporation s mortgage loans are located 
at december   the commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled billion and is secured by properties located primarily in colorado  iowa  arizona and missouri 
at december   the commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled billion and was secured by properties located primarily in colorado  iowa and arizona 
there are no significant credit risk concerns related to the business and economic conditions in the states where the commercial real estate securing the corporation s commercial real estate loans are located 
nonperforming assets are monitored on a regular basis by the corporation s internal credit review and problem asset teams 
nonperforming assets at december are summarized as follows dollars in thousands nonperforming loans residential real estate commercial real estate consumer  commerical operating and other loans total nonperforming loans foreclosed real estate commercial residential total foreclosed real estate troubled debt restructurings commercial residential total troubled debt restructurings total nonperforming assets nonperforming loans to loans receivable nonperforming assets to total assets allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses to loans receivable total nonperforming loans nonperforming loans consist of nonaccruing loans generally loans days or more past due and accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more 
at december   and  there were no accruing loans contractually past due days or more 
residential real estate loans are considered nonperforming if four or more monthly payments are missed 
credit card loans continue to accrue interest up to days past due at which point the credit card loan balances plus accrued interest are charged off 
a troubled debt restructuring is a loan on which the corporation  for reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the debtor that the corporation would not otherwise consider 
the concession could be a reduction in the loan s interest rate  a reduction in the face amount of the debt  or an extension of the maturity date of the loan 
based on the net book value of loans receivable before deducting allowance for loan losses at the respective dates 

table of contents the table above excludes nonperforming loans held for sale totaling million  million and million  respectively  at december   and  related to the gnma optional repurchase program 
these guaranteed mortgage loans serviced for gnma include loans that have been repurchased or are eligible for repurchase by the corporation at the corporation s option and without prior authorization from gnma when specific delinquency criteria are met 
therefore  the corporation is deemed to have regained effective control over these assets 
these nonperforming loans are guaranteed by the fha or va with the corporation either reselling these loans or undertaking collection efforts through the fha va foreclosure process for reimbursement of these repurchased loans 
the corporation is reimbursed for substantially all costs incurred after the foreclosure process is complete 
nonperforming loans at december  decreased by million compared to december   due primarily to net decreases in commercial real estate loans totaling million and residential real estate loans totaling million 
the reduction in the nonperforming loans is partially attributable to the foreclosure of real estate collateralizing certain loans in addition to the strength of the credit underwriting  loan review and collection processes of the corporation 
nonperforming loans at december  decreased by million compared to december   due primarily to net decreases in residential real estate loans totaling million and commercial real estate loans totaling million 
the higher concentrations of nonperforming loans at december  were secured by properties in iowa  oklahoma  colorado and kansas 
similarly  the higher concentration levels of nonperforming loans at december  were secured by properties located in iowa  oklahoma and kansas 
the economy of these midwestern markets has remained relatively stable during the million increase in foreclosed real estate at december  compared to is due to capitalized expenses totaling million on the residential master planned community property in nevada and the foreclosure of a residential construction project in colorado totaling million 
foreclosed real estate decreased million at december  compared to december  due primarily to the sale of a commercial construction property totaling million 
foreclosed real estate at december   is located primarily in nevada  colorado and iowa  compared to december   where the highest concentrations were located primarily in nevada  iowa and missouri  and to december   where the higher concentrations were located primarily in nevada  missouri and arizona 
troubled debt restructurings increased million at december   compared to december   primarily due to the restructuring of a commercial real estate loan during the march quarter 
troubled debt restructurings decreased million at december   compared to december   due primarily to the reclassification of seven loans totaling million from troubled debt restructuring status to current loan status 
non interest income retail fees and charges the major components of retail fees and charges for the years ended december are as follows in thousands nonsufficient fund charges and overdraft fees service charges debit and credit card fees  net transaction fees and other retail fees and charges 
table of contents the primary source of retail fees is customer charges for retail financial services such as checking account fees and service charges  charges for insufficient checks or uncollected funds  stop payment fees  debit card annual fees  overdraft protection fees  transaction fees for personal checking  interchange revenue from use of debit and credit cards and automatic teller machine services 
the net increases in nonsufficient fund and overdraft fees totaling million  comparing to are due primarily to increases in transaction volumes and a increase in the number of checking accounts 
the increase in debit and credit card fees of  comparing to is due to an increase in the number of accounts and the dollar amounts of transactions comparing the respective periods 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of interchange fees for debit card purchases effective august   due to a third party settlement of debit card litigation with visa inc to which the corporation was not a party 
as a result of this litigation  the interchange rate paid for debit card transactions was reduced and therefore  the corporation  which issues visa debit cards  will generate less fee income per debit card transaction in the future 
the increase in retail fees and charges over is primarily due to an increased retail pricing structure effective september   increased debit card annual fees charged in and an increase in the number of checking accounts 
loan servicing fees and mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustment the major components of loan servicing fees for the years ended december and the amount of loans serviced for other institutions are as follows in thousands revenue loan servicing fees late loan payment fees total revenues amortization of mortgage servicing rights loan servicing fees  net valuation adjustment for impairment loans serviced for other institutions at year end the amount of revenue generated from loan servicing fees  and changes in comparing periods  is primarily due to the average size of the corporation s portfolio of mortgage loans serviced for other institutions and the level of rates for service fees collected 
revenue from loan servicing fees is reduced by the amortization expense of mortgage servicing rights and  as necessary  adjusted for changes to the valuation allowance for impairment 
the loan servicing fees category also includes fees collected for late loan payments 
the increase in revenue from loan servicing fees comparing to is due to a higher average balance of mortgage loans serviced for others of billion during compared to billion during the higher average balance of loans serviced for others relates to the purchases of loan servicing portfolios of billion during the latter part of  net of a sale of servicing which occurred during the second quarter of for million 
the average service fee rate remained constant at 
for compared to mortgage servicing rights are amortized over the period of estimated net servicing income 
since the expected net servicing income cash flows have been reduced as a result of a sharp increase in loan prepayments during this period of historically low interest rates  amortization expense of mortgage servicing rights has significantly increased comparing periods 
management anticipates significantly lower levels of mortgage servicing rights amortization during since interest rates which drive this amortization are expected to remain near the level of interest rates in effect toward the end of 
table of contents the fair value of the corporation s loan servicing portfolio decreases as mortgage interest rates decline and loan prepayments increase 
conversely  the value of the corporation s loan servicing portfolio increases as mortgage interest rates rise 
the negative effect on the corporation s income caused by a decrease in the fair value of the loan servicing portfolio in a declining interest rate environment would be offset  in part  by increased revenue from loan servicing fees attributable to new loan originations  which historically have increased in periods of declining mortgage interest rates 
a valuation recovery totaling million was recorded during the year ended december   as an increase to the net carrying amount of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio as a result of an increase in interest rates during the latter part of this recovery compares to a valuation adjustment loss recorded for the year ended december   totaling million in response to declining market interest rates 
at december   the valuation allowance on the mortgage servicing rights portfolio totaled million compared to million at december  the net decrease in revenue from loan servicing comparing the year ended december  to is due to a lower level of service fee rates comparing the respective years slightly offset by a higher average balance of mortgage loans serviced 
the average service fee rate collected by the corporation was 
for the year ended december   compared to 
for the year ended december  the mortgage loans serviced for other institutions increased at december   compared to december   due to the purchases of loan servicing portfolios in totaling billion 
the increase in amortization expense of mortgage servicing rights during compared to reflects an increase in loan prepayments due to the lower interest rate environment comparing the respective years 
in addition  since mortgage servicing rights are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value  valuation adjustments in impairment losses totaling million and million  respectively  were recorded during the years ended december  and at december   the valuation allowance on the mortgage servicing rights portfolio totaled million compared to million at december  gain on sales of securities and changes in fair values of derivatives  net the following transactions were recorded during the years ended december in thousands gain on the sales of available for sale securities investment securities mortgage backed securities net gain on the sales of available for sale securities changes in the fair values of interest rate floor agreements not qualifying for hedge accounting termination of interest rate swap agreements other items  net subtotal gain on the sales of securities and changes in fair values of derivatives  net during  the corporation reduced the size of its balance sheet as part of a strategic plan to reduce available for sale investment and mortgage backed securities that are lower margin contributors to net interest income 
this plan included decreasing the size of the lower yielding investment and mortgage backed available for sale securities portfolios and paying down a portion of fhlb debt 
during the year ended december   the corporation sold available for sale investment and mortgage backed securities totaling billion resulting in a pre tax net gain of million 
a portion of this gain was recognized to partially offset the impact to net income caused by the recognition of a million loss on the termination of certain interest rate swap agreements that were previously hedging the interest payments of million in adjustable rate fhlb advances that were paid off 
before these fhlb advances were paid off  the fair value loss for these interest rate swap agreements was previously recorded as a component of other comprehensive income since these swap 
table of contents agreements were designated as cash flow hedges 
the corporation s sales of securities also reflect gains and losses recognized to strategically offset valuation adjustments of its mortgage servicing rights asset  higher levels of amortization of its mortgage servicing rights asset  and accelerated amortization of net deferred costs and premiums on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities due to the low interest rate environment and the resulting significant increase in mortgage loan prepayments 
the corporation expects to continue to offset valuation adjustments of mortgage servicing rights with securities gains and losses during during the years ended december  and  the corporation sold available for sale investment and mortgage backed securities totaling approximately billion for each year resulting in pre tax net gains of million and million  respectively 
these net gains were recognized to partially offset the valuation adjustment losses of million and million  respectively  in the mortgage servicing rights portfolio for the years ended december  and at december   and  the corporation had interest rate floor agreements with notional amounts totaling billion  billion and million  respectively  with a net market valuation adjustment loss totaling million for  a net gain totaling million for  and a net loss totaling  for these interest rate floor agreements are used to protect the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio to impairment exposure risk from declining interest rates 
gain on sales of loans the corporation s mortgage banking activities involve the origination of mortgage loans and the subsequent sale of these mortgage loans in the secondary market with loan servicing retained and without recourse to the corporation 
the category in the consolidated statement of income entitled gain on sales of loans includes changes in the fair values of certain derivative financial instruments forward loan sales commitments  rate lock commitments to originate mortgage loans held for sale and call options and hedged items warehouse loans in addition to net realized gains on the sales of loans 
these derivative financial instruments related to mortgage banking activities and certain hedged warehouse loans are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value reported in current earnings 
warehouse loans which do not have critical matched terms with related forward loan sales commitments that are used to hedge them are carried at the lower of cost or market

during the years ended december   and  loans totaling billion  billion and billion  respectively  were sold 
the significant increases in the volume of loans sold during and compared to the prior year relate to record mortgage loan production volumes as consumers took advantage of historically low market interest rates to refinance or originate mortgage loans 
the increase in gains on sales of loans comparing to relates to the corporation taking advantage of pricing opportunities resulting from historically low interest rates and unprecedented loan demand during however  gains on sales of loans decreased in from as peak volumes of residential mortgage loans held for sale slowed down during the latter part of and pricing spreads began to shrink in response to changing competitive market factors 
management anticipates a continued reduction in the level of gains on sales of loans during primarily due to lower expected mortgage loan production volumes and competitive market conditions 
bank owned life insurance in december  the corporation invested in two boli policies with a contract value of million

table of contents other operating income the following details the major components of other operating income for the years ended december in thousands brokerage commissions insurance services income credit life and disability commissions loan fee income other total other operating income net changes in brokerage commissions comparing to is due to increased customer activity in the stock market as consumer confidence in the stock market began to improve during insurance services income decreased slightly comparing periods due primarily to increases in life insurance and accident and health insurance related expenses 
credit life and disability commissions decreased million in compared to due to lower commission rates on policies sold and lower sales as a result of regulatory changes that capped the amount of credit life insurance that could be sold in connection with a consumer loan 
the million increase in loan fee income is related to increased loan production and prepayment activity as a result of the low interest rate environment 
brokerage commissions decreased million comparing to due to decreased volumes of customer transactions attributable to the overall drop in stock market activity and value during loan fee income increased million in compared to primarily due to additional fees generated  such as prepayment fees  from the significant volume of mortgage loan refinance activity 
credit life and disability commissions increased during over due to increased volumes in policies written

this net increase in general and administrative expenses resulted in an unfavorable increase in the corporation s efficiency ratio to at december   from at december  compensation and benefits increased million due primarily to increased labor costs associated with record levels of loan prepayments  increased production incentive bonuses  annual merit increases and increased employee benefits and taxes 
loan expenses increased million primarily as a result of significantly higher loan servicing expenses related to loan prepayment activity 
occupancy and equipment increased million due primarily to additional costs related to new branch expansion and retail system upgrades comparing the respective periods 
advertising increased  primarily due to a cash back incentive program for debit and credit card transactions that generated higher interchange revenue for the bank offset by increased expenses in the first part of and expanded promotions of products relating to checking accounts and internet banking 
other operating expenses decreased million for compared to due primarily to decreases in contributions totaling million and decreased losses on the sale of fixed assets totaling million 
these decreases to other operating expenses were partially offset by a net gain totaling  on the sale of four minnesota branches in which reduced expenses 
foreclosed real estate expenses decreased million due primarily to a million impairment loss recorded in the period on the residential master planned community property in nevada 
outside services decreased million due primarily to decreases in consulting services comparing periods 

table of contents management of the corporation expects general and administrative expense growth for to approximate general inflationary trends 
the net increase of million in general and administrative expenses for compared to is primarily due to the net gain of million in exit costs and termination benefits recorded in and to an increase in compensation and benefits  losses and impairments on assets  an increase in advertising  write off of deferred debt issuance costs and additional charitable contributions

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the corporation manages its liquidity at both the parent company and subsidiary levels 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the corporation has the continuing ability to maintain cash flows that are sufficient to fund operational needs and meet obligations and other commitments on a timely and cost effective basis 
the parent company requires cash for the payment of dividends on its common stock  repurchases of its common stock  principal and interest payments on borrowings  and income tax payments 
the principal asset of the parent company is its investment in the capital stock of the bank 
since the parent company does not generate any significant revenues independent of the bank  the parent company s liquidity is dependent on the extent to which it receives cash distributions from the bank and the extent to which it is able to borrow funds 
the parent company also receives funds from the bank for income tax benefits from operating losses of the parent company as provided in the corporate tax sharing agreement 
in addition  the parent company also receives cash from the exercise of employee stock options 
the bank s ability to pay cash distributions to the parent company is dependent on its ability to generate earnings and is subject to a number of regulatory restrictions and tax considerations 
capital distribution regulations of the ots  as defined  allow the bank to pay capital distributions during a calendar year upon notice to the ots 
these capital distributions are limited to the sum of of the bank s retained net income defined as net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles less total capital distributions declared for the current calendar year plus the bank s retained net income for the preceding two calendar years 
capital distributions in excess of the bank s retained net income require the submission of an application for approval from the ots 
at december   the bank s total distributions exceeded its retained net income by million under this regulation thereby requiring the bank to file an application with the ots for any capital distribution 
with the significant increase in the parent company s repurchases of its common stock in at a cost of million  up from million in  the parent company required increased cash distributions from the bank totaling million in  up from million in as an additional source of cash  in september  the parent company received proceeds of million  through commercial federal capital trust i  a delaware statutory trust of the parent company  through the issuance of million of floating rate junior subordinated debt securities due october  see note other borrowings for additional information related to other borrowings 
during  the parent company repurchased its common stock at a cost of million which also required a significant distribution from the bank of million 
the parent company s ability to continue its common stock repurchases in is dependent on the bank s ability to generate sufficient earnings  while maintaining regulatory capital at a well capitalized level 
management closely evaluates its capital and liquidity position before stock repurchases are made 
see note stockholders equity and regulatory restrictions for additional information regarding the corporation s repurchases of its common stock 
cash dividends paid by the parent company to its common stock shareholders are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the corporation and depend on a variety of factors  including operating results and financial condition  liquidity  regulatory capital limitations and other factors 
payments of cash dividends totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the corporation has a goal of increasing dividends at or above the growth rate of earnings in future periods 
the corporation s ability to meet this goal will be contingent on the bank s capacity to pay cash distributions to the parent company in consideration of regulatory limitations 
the bank s primary sources of funds are i deposits  ii principal repayments on loans  mortgage backed and investment securities  iii advances from the fhlb and iv cash generated from operations 
deposits and fhlb advances continue to provide the bank with a significant source of stable funding 
the bank s continuing ability to retain and grow its deposit base depends on various factors  such as customer convenience  customer satisfaction and the competitiveness of the bank s products and interest rates offered 
management continues to focus on high customer service levels and actively considers competitive factors in determining its product 
table of contents offerings and pricing 
since management anticipates a continued reliance on fhlb advances as a significant source of funding  its asset liability management strategies consider the need to plan for the availability of required assets to pledge as collateral to obtain these funds 
management does not foresee any obstacles in the corporation s ability to continue to rely on deposits and fhlb advances as its primary sources of funding 
the variability in cash flow requirements related to mortgage banking activity can result in significant short term fluctuations in the level of cash provided or used by operating activities 
as mortgage rates decline  customer payoff and refinancing activities accelerate  while in an increasing rate environment  the opposite effect tends to occur 
the volatility in cash flows associated with loans held for sale is further impacted by the timing of cash outlays for mortgage loan originations and purchases and the receipt of proceeds for the sales of mortgage loans 
however  due to the cyclical pattern of mortgage loan originations purchases and sales and the short period of time between the origination or purchase of the loans and the subsequent sale generally  days or less  the amount of funding necessary to sustain the mortgage banking operations does not significantly affect the bank s overall liquidity requirements 
the short term variability in cash flows related to mortgage banking is supported by the net increase in cash provided by operating activities of million during  primarily attributable to the increase in proceeds from the sales of mortgage loans  net of cash outlays for the origination and purchase of mortgage loans held for sale totaling million during compared to conversely  the increase in net cash used by operations of million during resulted largely from the increase in cash outlays for the origination and purchase of mortgage loans held for sale exceeding proceeds from the sales of mortgage loans by million during compared to net cash provided or used by investing activities fluctuates from period to period primarily as a result of i principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  ii the purchase and origination of loans held for investment and iii the purchases and sales of mortgage backed and investment securities 
during and  investing activities generated net cash inflows of million and million  respectively  primarily due to significantly high levels of loan and mortgage backed security prepayments exceeding the cash outlays for the purchase and origination of loans 
these high prepayment levels occurred in response to the historically low interest rate environment during these years 
additionally  during  a significant amount of activity occurred relating to the bank s investment and mortgage backed securities portfolio generating a net cash outflow 
this activity involved the bank s sales of securities to generate gains or losses to strategically offset net valuation recoveries related to mortgage servicing rights totaling million  high levels of amortization of mortgage servicing rights  accelerated amortization of net deferred costs and premiums on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  and a million loss on the termination of certain interest rate swap agreements that were previously hedging fhlb debt that was paid down 
investment activity also occurred in conjunction with the bank s asset liability management strategies including sales of investments and mortgage backed securities that were lower margin contributors to net interest income 
during  investment activity also resulted in a net cash outflow 
this activity included the sales of securities to strategically generate gains to offset valuation adjustment losses of million recognized in the bank s mortgage servicing rights portfolio in addition to other investment activity related to the bank s asset liability management strategies 
net cash flows used by investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  a significant portion of this net cash outflow related to the divestiture of branches in conjunction with the corporation s strategic initiatives 
the divestiture of these branches was represented by a net million cash outflow consisting primarily of the outflow of deposits sold totaling million 
in addition  during the year ended december   the corporation sold investment and mortgage backed securities in part to offset the valuation adjustment loss of million in the mortgage servicing rights portfolio in addition to other investment activity related to the bank s asset liability management strategies 
a substantial portion of the leasing portfolio was also sold in for cash and a secured note for million 
net cash flows used by financing activities totaled million in primarily as a result of a net decrease of million in fhlb advances and the purchase of reverse repurchase agreements for million in conjunction with the bank s strategy to reduce its lower yielding investment and mortgage backed securities and pay down a portion of fhlb advances 
the purchase of the reverse repurchase agreements 
table of contents resulted in a decrease in the net level of funding from repurchase agreements since this million was offset as a reduction to repurchase agreements 
during  net cash provided by financing activities totaled million 
this net cash inflow resulted from a net increase of million in deposits  excluding the effect of branch sales  primarily related to an increase in money market and checking accounts largely due to new product promotions and a resulting increase in new customer accounts 
net cash provided by financing activities in totaled million primarily as a result of a net increase of million in cash provided by fhlb advances and a net decrease of million in deposits during due to the run off of higher costing certificates of deposits and the reduction in brokered deposits used for funding needs 
during  the bank issued and sold million of floating rate subordinated debt securities due december and million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures due december the million of subordinated debt securities and the million of junior subordinated debentures are includable as part of supplementary tier regulatory capital for the bank 
proceeds from these issuances were utilized by the bank to make capital distributions to the parent company 
capital adequacy the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
regulators can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary  actions if the bank fails to meet minimum capital requirements 
these actions could have a direct material effect on the corporation s financial position and results of operations 
the regulations require the bank to meet specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital classification is also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
see note regulatory capital for further information regarding the bank s regulatory capital levels and ratios relative to minimum requirements 
as of december   the most recent notification from the ots categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions under fdicia 
there are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the bank s classification 
management closely monitors its capital levels and intends to maintain a well capitalized classification 
contractual obligations and other commitments through the normal course of operations  the corporation enters into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
these obligations generally relate to funding of operations through debt issuances as well as leases for premises and equipment 
as a financial institution  the bank routinely enters into off balance sheet agreements including commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  and financial guarantees on loans sold with recourse and on other contingent obligations 
see note commitments and contingencies for more information regarding the corporation s commitments and guarantees 
loan commitments are generally expected to settle within three months following december  the outstanding commitments to originate loans or fund commercial and consumer lines of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval processes accorded to loans made by the corporation 
mortgage loan commitments include loans in the process of approval for which the corporation has rate lock commitments 
the corporation expects to fund these commitments  as necessary  from the sources of funds previously described 
certain commitments of the corporation are derivative financial instruments 
see asset liability management and note derivative financial instruments for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments

as discussed in liquidity and capital resources  management does not foresee any difficulties in meeting its liquidity requirements in order to ensure the safety and soundness of its operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial information are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant effect on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services

proposed accounting standards in october  the fasb added a project to its agenda to clarify sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  with respect to determining the fair value of interest rate lock commitments irlc 
specifically  the fasb project will address what information should be used to determine the fair value of an irlc and whether the irlc should ever be reported as an asset by the issuer 
in december  the sec staff announced that it intends to release a staff accounting bulletin that will require irlcs issued after april   to be accounted for as written options and reported as liabilities until expiration or termination of the commitment 
the corporation currently recognizes the net aggregate fair value of irlcs as an asset or a liability to offset the asset or liability recorded for the net aggregate fair value of forward loan sales commitments used to hedge these ircls 
neither the fasb nor the sec has issued final technical guidance in this area  and as such it is not possible to know for certain the impact of this guidance 
the primary effect will be moving the timing for recognition of gains on mortgage loans from interest rate lock date to loan sale date 
the corporation believes that if this proposed rule passes  the accounting treatment could materially misrepresent the corporation s loan production hedging activities since the timing for recognizing a loss on forward loan sales commitments may not be recognized in the same period as the gain associated with the irlc being hedged will be recognized 
management is uncertain as to the materiality that this proposed future guidance may have on the corporation s reported results since the volume of irlcs outstanding and the fair value of irlcs at a point in time can vary significantly when changes in market interest rates occur
