item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
executive overview general mills is a global consumer foods company 
we develop differentiated food products and market these value added products under unique brand names 
we work continuously on product innovation to improve our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences 
in addition  we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer directed marketing and innovative merchandising 
we believe our brand building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 
our businesses are organized into three segments 
our us retail segment accounted for approximately percent of our fiscal net sales  and reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores  specialty stores  drug and discount chains  and mass merchandisers operating throughout the united states 
our major product categories in this business segment are ready to eat cereals  meals  refrigerated and frozen dough products  baking products  snacks  yogurt and organic foods 
our bakeries and foodservice segment generated approximately percent of fiscal net sales 
this business segment consists of products marketed to retail and wholesale bakeries  and to commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators throughout the united states and canada 
the remaining percent of our fiscal net sales was generated by our consolidated international businesses 
these include a retail business in canada that largely mirrors our us retail product mix  along with retail and foodservice businesses competing in key markets in europe  latin america and the asia pacific region 
in addition to these consolidated operations  we participate in several joint ventures 
we record our proportionate share of after tax earnings or losses from these ventures 
in fiscal  joint ventures accounted for million of our after tax earnings 
our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term by delivering consistent growth in sales and earnings  coupled with an attractive dividend yield 
we have met this objective over the most recent five year period fiscal to  as general mills total return to shareholders has averaged percent while the s p index has posted a negative percent average annual return over this period 
however  in the most recent fiscal year the percent return of the s p index outperformed our percent return 
we achieved good sales and earnings gains in fiscal  which included the benefit of an extra week 
for the week period ended may   our net sales grew percent and diluted earnings per share grew percent 
details of our financial results are provided in the results of operations section below 
our cash flow in was strong  enabling us to pay out almost percent of earnings as dividends  make significant fixed asset investments to support future growth and productivity  and reduce the balance of our adjusted debt plus minority interests by million see definition of adjusted debt on page of this report 
we have prioritized debt repayment as a use of cash for the three year period through fiscal our goal is to reduce the balance of our adjusted debt plus minority interests by a cumulative billion by the end of  and thereby improve our fixed charge coverage to the levels we demonstrated prior to our acquisition of pillsbury in october while our earnings results in were good overall  they fell short of our initial expectations for the year due to three principal factors 
first  higher commodity costs reduced our gross margin 
second  the recent popularity of low carbohydrate diets slowed sales in several of our major product categories 
and finally  our bakeries and foodservice business fell well short of targeted results  due in part to the low carbohydrate trend and higher supply chain costs 
these results also reflect disruption caused by our own manufacturing realignment actions and decisions to eliminate low margin product lines in a number of customer categories 
in fiscal  we face several challenges that will hinder earnings growth 
the first obvious hurdle is the fact that we will have one less week of business in going up against week results in but beyond that  commodity prices continue to rise our business plan assumes a significant increase in commodity costs compared to our expense 
energy costs and our salary and benefit expense are expected to be higher 
and from an operations perspective  we need to stabilize trends in our bakeries and foodservice segment 
to partially offset the higher input costs we are experiencing  we have increased list prices on certain product lines 
we also plan to increase merchandised price points for certain products 
however  these actions won t entirely cover our increased costs 
we plan to capture additional supply chain productivity during  and we will continue to control administrative costs companywide 
we also have identified opportunities to reconfigure certain manufacturing activities to improve our cost structure 
we believe the key driver of our results in will be the success of our product innovation  which is critical to achieving unit volume growth 
our business plans include new product activity and innovations that respond to consumers interest in health and nutrition  convenience and new flavor varieties

as a result  gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal selling  general and administrative costs decreased by million from fiscal to fiscal  driven by a million decrease in merger related costs 
these merger related costs are infrequently occurring items related to the planning and execution of the integration of pillsbury  including consulting  system conversions  relocation  training and communications 
net interest expense decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to favorable interest rates 
we have in place a net amount of interest rate swaps that convert million of floating rate debt to fixed rates 
our portfolio of interest rate swaps has an average life of years and has an average fixed rate of percent 
taking into account the effect of all of our interest rate swaps  the average interest rate on our total outstanding debt as of may  was approximately percent 
restructuring and other exit costs were million in fiscal  as described in more detail in note three to the consolidated financial statements 
approximately million was related to plant closures in the netherlands  brazil and california 
we recorded an additional million primarily related to adjustments of costs associated with previously announced closures of manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we recorded million for severance  primarily related to realignment actions in our bakeries and foodservice organization 
our fiscal results included restructuring and other exit costs of million 
these costs also are discussed in note three

the acquisition of pillsbury  on oct 
  significantly affected fiscal comparisons for our results of operations  as our fiscal results include only seven months of ownership of the pillsbury businesses 
net earnings including cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  adopted in fiscal  as described in more detail in the section below titled new accounting rules were million  up percent from fiscal diluted earnings per share were compared to in fiscal annual net sales rose percent  to billion  driven by a percent increase in worldwide unit volume for fiscal the balance of the net sales growth was primarily attributable to promotional efficiencies 
on a comparable basis  as if general mills had owned pillsbury for all of fiscal  worldwide unit volume grew percent 
this performance reflected improvement in our us retail segment  but was constrained by economic factors limiting growth in our bakeries and foodservice segment and latin american operations in our international segment 
us retail unit volume comparable for pillsbury grew percent in fiscal all of our us retail divisions experienced volume growth except baking products  which declined due to significant competitive promotional activity 
net sales for these operations totaled billion in fiscal  compared to billion in fiscal operating profits totaled billion  up percent from the prior year 
bakeries and foodservice results in fiscal included unit volume comparable for pillsbury that was essentially unchanged from fiscal  reflecting overall weak foodservice industry trends 
net sales reached billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal  while operating profit was million  up only percent from the prior year in spite of the inclusion of twelve months of pillsbury results in fiscal compared to seven months of results included in fiscal international unit volume comparable for pillsbury declined percent in fiscal  driven by a percent decline in latin america that was nearly offset by volume growth in canada  europe and asia 
net sales totaled billion in fiscal compared to million in  and operating profits grew to million  more than double the prior year s million total 
impact of inflation it is our view that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on profitability over the three most recent years other than as noted above related to commodities 
we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices 
our market risk management practices are discussed later in this section 
cash flows sources and uses of cash in the past three years are shown in the following table 
over the most recent three year period  general mills operations have generated billion in cash 
in  cash flow from operations totaled nearly billion 
that was down from the previous year as a million increase in operating earnings before depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes and restructuring and other exit costs was more than offset by an increase in working capital of million in versus a decrease of million in the increase in the use of working capital in fiscal was due primarily to three factors 
one of the factors was that the accounts payable balance as of may  was million below last year s balance primarily due to lower accrued liabilities  such as trade promotion liabilities  driven by faster cash payments 
a second factor was a reduction in miscellaneous other current liabilities of million due primarily to payments against integration and restructuring liabilities 
the third factor was net income tax payments in of million versus net payments of million in cash sources uses fiscal year in millions from continuing operations   from discontinued operations purchases of land  buildings and equipment  net investments in businesses  intangibles and affiliates  net change in marketable securities proceeds from disposition of businesses other investments  net increase decrease in outstanding debt  net  proceeds from minority investors common stock issued treasury stock purchases  dividends paid other increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal  capital investment for land  buildings and equipment  and intangibles fell to million from million last year  and included expenditures for the completion of new facilities at our minneapolis headquarters campus and expenditures associated with the acquisition and integration of pillsbury 
we expect capital expenditures to decrease further in fiscal  to between and million 
dividends in totaled per share  a payout of percent of diluted earnings per share 
the board of directors announced a percent increase in dividends to an annual rate of per share  effective with the dividend payable on aug 
 we did not repurchase a significant number of shares in fiscal  nor do we expect to repurchase a significant number of shares in fiscal financial condition our notes payable and total long term debt totaled billion as of may  we also consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our debt structure  and we use a measurement of adjusted debt plus minority interests  as shown in the table below 
this adjusted debt plus minority interests declined by million  to billion  and our stockholders equity grew to billion 
the market value of general mills stockholders equity increased as well  as an increase in shares outstanding was partially offset by a slight decline in share price 
as of may   our equity market capitalization was billion  based on a price of per share and million basic shares outstanding 
our total market capitalization  including adjusted debt  minority interests and equity capital  fell from billion as of may  to billion as of may  capital structure in millions may  may  notes payable  current portion of long term debt long term debt   total debt   debt adjustments deferred income taxes tax leases leases debt equivalent certain cash and cash equivalents marketable investments  at cost adjusted debt   minority interests adjusted debt plus minority interests   stockholders equity   total capital   in fiscal we refinanced million of our short term debt through the following issuances million of percent year notes that were subsequently swapped to month libor plus basis points  and a million year term loan at month libor plus basis points 
we consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our fixed rate obligations 
the next table  when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure table  shows the composition of our debt structure including the impact of using derivative instruments 
debt structure in millions may  may  floating rate  fixed rate   leases debt equivalent deferred income taxes tax leases adjusted debt plus minority interests   at the end of fiscal  approximately percent of our adjusted debt plus minority interests was long term 
commercial paper is a continuing source of short term financing 
we can issue commercial paper in the united states and canada  as well as in europe  through a program established in fiscal our commercial paper borrowings are supported by billion in committed credit lines 
currently  we have no outstanding borrowings under these credit lines 
the following table details the fee paid credit lines we had available as of may  committed credit facilities amount expiration core facilities billion january billion january total credit lines billion on june   we filed a universal shelf registration statement the shelf with the securities and exchange commission covering the sale of up to billion of debt securities  common stock  preference stock  depository shares  securities warrants  purchase contracts  purchase units and units all described in the shelf 
in addition  the shelf covers resales of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock owned by an affiliate of diageo plc 
when the shelf becomes effective  our existing shelf registration will be incorporated therein 
we believe that two important measures of financial strength are the ratios of fixed charge coverage and cash flow to adjusted debt plus minority interests 
our fixed charge coverage in fiscal was times compared to times in fiscal  and cash flow to adjusted debt plus minority interests was percent compared to percent in fiscal we expect to pay down at least million of adjusted debt plus minority interests in fiscal  as part of a cumulative billion reduction in adjusted debt plus minority interests planned over the three year period ending in fiscal our goal is to return to a mid single a rating for our long term debt  and to the top tier short term rating  where we were prior to our announcement of the pillsbury acquisition 
currently  standard and poor s corporation has ratings of bbb on our publicly held long term debt and a on our commercial paper 
moody s investors services  inc has ratings of baa for our long term debt and p for our commercial paper 
fitch ratings  inc rates our long term debt bbb and our commercial paper f dominion bond rating service in canada currently rates general mills as a low 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations it is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to third parties 
we have  however  issued guarantees of approximately million for the debt and other obligations of unconsolidated affiliates  primarily cpw and sve 
in addition  off balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases  which totaled approximately million at may  the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations  including payments due by period 
the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for projected raw material and packaging needs to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer directed marketing commitments that support our brands 
information concerning other long term liabilities that consist primarily of retirement and other postretirement benefits and the fair value of outstanding interest hedges has been provided in note fourteen and note seven  respectively 
in millions  payments due by fiscal year total and thereafter long term debt including current portion   operating leases purchase obligations   total     critical accounting policies for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  please see note one to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results  and that may require significant management judgment and estimates 
these policies include our accounting for trade and consumer promotion activities  asset impairments  income taxes  and pension and postretirement liabilities 
trade and consumer promotion activities we report sales net of certain coupon and trade promotion costs 
the trade promotion costs include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf  such as advertising or in store displays  discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices  and payments to gain distribution of new products 
the amount and timing of expense recognition for trade and consumer promotion activities involve management judgment related to estimated participation and performance levels 
the vast majority of year end liabilities associated with these activities are resolved within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require highly uncertain long term estimates 
for interim reporting  we estimate the annual trade promotion expense and recognize pro rata period expense generally in proportion to revenue  adjusted for estimated year to date expenditures if greater than the pro rata amount 
certain trade and consumer promotion expenses are recorded as reductions of net sales 
promotional funds for our retail businesses are initially established at the beginning of each year  and paid out over the course of the year based on the customer s performance of agreed upon merchandising activity 
during the year  additional funds may also be used in response to competitive activities  as a result of changes in the mix of our marketing support  or to help achieve interim unit volume targets 
we set annual sales objectives and interim targets as a regular practice to manage our business 
our sales employees are salaried  and are eligible for annual cash incentives based on performance against objectives set at the start of the year 
these objectives include goals for unit volume and the trade promotion cost per unit required to achieve the unit volume goal 
our sales employees have discretion to plan and adjust the timing of merchandising activity over the course of the year  and they also have some discretion to adjust the level of trade promotion funding applied to a particular event 
our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter 
in comparison to the average daily shipments in the first weeks of a quarter  the final week of each quarter has approximately two to four days worth of incremental shipments based on a five day week  reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter 
this increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter  as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets 
this increased sales activity results in shipments that are in direct response to orders from customers or authorized pursuant to pre arranged inventory management agreements  and accordingly are recognized as revenue within that quarter 
the two to four day range of increased unit volume in the last week of each quarter has been generally consistent from quarter to quarter over the last three years 
as part of our effort to assess the results of our promotional activities  we regularly estimate the amount of retailer inventory in the system defined as product that we have shipped to our customers that has not yet been purchased from our customers by the end consumer 
while it is not possible for us to measure the absolute level of inventory  we are able to estimate the change that occurs each month by comparing our shipments to retail customers with their sales to end consumers takeaway as reported by acnielsen 
our estimate indicates inventory levels peak in november when retailers have increased inventories to meet seasonal demand for products like refrigerated dough and ready to serve soup 
this seasonal trend is generally consistent from year to year  even as retailers have taken actions to reduce their ongoing inventory levels 
we also assess the effectiveness of our promotional activities by evaluating the end consumer purchases of our products subsequent to the reporting period 
if  due to quarter end promotions or other reasons  our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than end consumer demand will require in future periods  then our sales level in future reporting periods would be adversely affected 
as part of our ongoing evaluation of sales  we also monitor customer returns 
we generally do not allow a right of return on our products 
however  on a limited case by case basis with prior approval  we may allow customers to return products in saleable condition for redistribution to other customers or outlets 
these returns are recorded as reductions of net sales in the period of the return 
monthly returns are consistently below percent of sales  and have averaged approximately percent of total monthly shipments over the last three years 
asset impairments we are required to evaluate our long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment and write down the value of any assets when they are determined to be impaired 
evaluating the impairment of long lived assets involves management judgment in estimating the fair values and future cash flows related to these assets 
although the predictability of long term cash flows may be uncertain  our evaluations indicate fair values for our long lived assets and goodwill that are significantly in excess of stated book values 
therefore  we believe the risk of unrecognized impairment is low 
income taxes income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax issues 
historically  our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate 
the current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items 
pension accounting the accounting for pension and other postretirement liabilities requires the estimation of several critical factors 
as detailed in note fourteen to the consolidated financial statements  key assumptions that determine this income include the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets 
our discount rate assumption is determined annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds 
the discount rate used to determine the pension and other postretirement obligations as of the balance sheet date is the rate in effect as of that measurement date 
that same discount rate also is used to determine pension and other postretirement income or expense for the following fiscal year 
our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation  our historical long term investment performance  our estimate of future long term returns by asset class using input from our actuaries  investment services and investment managers  and long term inflation assumptions 
in addition to our assumptions about the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets  we base our determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets which reduces year to year volatility in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
as of may   we had cumulative losses of approximately million on our pension plans and million on our postretirement plans 
these unrecognized net actuarial losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by sfas no 
and sfas no 
in fiscal  we recorded net pension and postretirement expense of million compared to million of income in fiscal  net of million of curtailments 
the discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were percent for the obligation as of may  and for our fiscal income and expense estimate  and percent for the obligation as of may  and for our fiscal income and expense estimate 
for fiscal we assumed a rate of return of percent on our pension plan assets and percent on our other postretirement plan assets 
for fiscal we reduced our rate of return assumptions to percent for assets in both plans 
for our fiscal pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate  we have increased the discount rate to percent  based on interest rates as of may  the expected rate of return on plan assets remains percent 
based on these rates and various other assumptions including the amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses  we estimate that our net pension and postretirement expense  exclusive of curtailments  if any  will approximate million in fiscal compared to expense of million  exclusive of curtailments  in fiscal actual future net pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension and postretirement plans 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on assets by basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal by approximately million 
new accounting rules on the first day of fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires all derivatives to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and establishes new accounting rules for hedging 
we recorded the cumulative effect of adopting this accounting change in fiscal  as follows in millions  except per share data included in earnings included in accumulated other comprehensive income pretax income tax effects total effect on diluted earnings per share 
this cumulative effect was primarily associated with the impact of lower interest rates on the fair value calculation for delayed starting interest rate swaps we entered into in anticipation of our pillsbury acquisition and other financing requirements 
refer to note seven and note ten for more information 
on the first day of fiscal  we also adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  the third statement we adopted at the start of fiscal was sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
this statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment 
transitional impairment tests of our goodwill did not require adjustment to any of our goodwill carrying values 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which requires recording certain coupon and trade promotion expenses as reductions of revenues 
since adopting this requirement resulted only in the reclassification of certain expenses from selling  general and administrative expense to a reduction of net sales  it did not affect our financial position or net earnings 
effective the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosure requirements of guarantees  as well as requiring the recording of certain guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin did not require any material change in our guarantee disclosures see note seventeen 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the adoption of this standard affected the timing of the recognition of exit or disposal costs for disposal activities initiated after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides companies with alternative methods of transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we have not elected the fair value based method of accounting 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation  as reflected in note one l to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability  or as an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  sfas no 
was implemented in our second quarter of fiscal and did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin 
fin requires that interests in variable interest entities that are considered to be special purpose entities be included in the financial statements for the year ended may  fin was implemented in our fourth quarter of fiscal and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revision to sfas no 
requires additional disclosures for pension and other postretirement benefits plans  which are presented in note fourteen retirement and other postretirement benefit plans 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of act was signed into law on december  the act introduced a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare 
financial accounting standards board staff position fsp provides accounting guidance related to the act 
we adopted fsp at the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal and it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
see note fourteen retirement and other postretirement benefit plans 
market risk management our company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions  authorized under company policies that place clear controls on these activities 
the counterparties in these transactions are highly rated institutions 
our hedging transactions include but are not limited to the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivatives only where there is an underlying exposure  we do not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
additional information regarding our use of financial instruments is included in note seven to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates we manage our debt structure and our interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt  and through the use of derivatives 
we use interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes  and also to reduce volatility of our financing costs 
generally under these swaps  we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount 
our primary exposure is to us interest rates 
as of may   we had billion of agreed notional principal amounts the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated outstanding  including amounts that neutralize exposure through offsetting swaps see notes seven and eight to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency rates foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates 
these contracts function as hedges  since they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate 
our primary exchange rate exposures are with the canadian dollar  the euro  the australian dollar  the mexican peso and the british pound against the us dollar 
commodities certain ingredients used in our products are exposed to commodity price changes 
we manage this risk through an integrated set of financial instruments  including purchase orders  noncancelable contracts  futures contracts  futures options and swaps 
our primary commodity price exposures are to cereal grains  vegetables  dairy products  sugar  vegetable oils  meats  fruits  other agricultural products  packaging materials and energy costs 
value at risk these estimates are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value general mills could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates  foreign exchange rates or commodity prices  under normal market conditions 
a monte carlo var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures 
the models assumed normal market conditions and used a percent confidence level 
the var calculation used historical interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future 
the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics tm data set 
the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur 
further  since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure  we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
the positions included in the calculations were debt  investments  interest rate swaps  foreign exchange forwards  and commodity swaps  futures and options 
the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities related positions that are hedged by these market risk sensitive instruments
