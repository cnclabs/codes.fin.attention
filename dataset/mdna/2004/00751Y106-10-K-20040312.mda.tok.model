item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under forward looking statements and risk factors elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december of each year 
our first quarter consists of weeks  and the other three quarters consist of weeks  with the exception of the fourth quarter fiscal which contained weeks due to our week fiscal year in introduction in  we produced strong operating results and built momentum to carry us into what we believe will be another successful year in our performance and our positive outlook for  is primarily a result of our management team s focus to drive top line sales growth and increase our operating margins through our category management initiatives  our national advertising campaign and leveraging our logistics and operating expenses 
the category management initiative not only drives top line sales by developing improved product assortments by category but also focusing on maximizing gross profit within each product category offered 
for  we grew our total sales by over last year to billion  including the rd week 
we also improved our operating margins to of total sales  including the rd week  an increase of over in addition to the above initiatives  our operating margins benefited from leveraging our selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  we evaluate the quality of our results based on growth in certain key financial metrics 
these key indicators consist primarily of for year ended for year ended for year ended comparable store sales growth diy comparable stores sales growth difm comparable stores sales growth average net sales per store in thousands   inventory per store in thousands   inventory turnover gross margins operating margins note these metrics should be reviewed along with the selected financial data elsewhere in the annual report on form k  which includes descriptions regarding the calculation of these measures 
all financial metrics include the rd week  except the average net sales per store metric 
general we operated stores within the united states  puerto rico and the virgin islands 
at january   we operated  stores throughout states in the northeastern  southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states 
these stores operated primarily under the advance auto parts trade name except for the state of florida  which operated under advance discount auto parts or discount auto parts trade names 
these stores offered automotive replacement parts  accessories and maintenance items  with no significant concentration in any specific area 
in addition  we operated stores under the western auto trade name  located primarily in puerto rico and the virgin islands  which offer certain home and garden merchandise in addition to automotive parts  accessories and service 
fiscal number of stores at beginning of year   new stores closed stores number of stores  end of period    relocated stores stock split on october   our board of directors declared a two for one stock split of our common stock  effected as a stock dividend 
the dividend was distributed on january  to holders of record as of december  and began trading on a post split basis on january  all references to share and per share amounts in this discussion and analysis reflect the effect of the stock split 
discontinued operations on december   we discontinued the supplying of merchandise to our wholesale distribution network 
the wholesale distribution network  or wholesale  consisted of independently owned and operated dealer locations  for which we supplied merchandise inventory and certain services 
due to the wide variety of products supplied to the dealers and the reduced concentration of stores spread over a wide geographic area  it had become difficult to serve these dealers effectively 
this component of our business operated in the wholesale segment and excluding certain allocated and team member benefit expenses of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  represented the entire results of operations previously reported in that segment 
we have classified these operating results as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended january   december  and december  to reflect this decision 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates 
vendor incentives as discussed further elsewhere in this report  we recognize certain vendor incentives earned related to long term supply agreements as a reduction to cost of sales over the life of the agreement based on the timing of purchases  not as reductions to inventory 
the functional amounts earned under long term arrangements are based on our estimate of total purchases that will be made over the life of the contracts and the amount of incentives that will be earned 
the incentives are generally recognized based on the cumulative purchases as a percentage of total estimated purchases over the life of the contract 
the estimate of total purchases are highly sensitive to market demand for certain product and could positively or negatively impact our gross margins if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates  however  incentives earned over the life of the contract would be the same 
inventory reserves we establish reserves for inventory shrink for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting program 
our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the accuracy of the program  which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required procedures 
we evaluate the accuracy of this program on an on going basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the established reserves 
if the effectiveness of the program declines management estimates will be required to ensure the accuracy of the overall shrink reserves 
reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are recorded as well based on current inventory levels of discontinued product and historical analysis of the liquidation of discontinued inventory below cost 
the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit 
we provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost 
we develop these estimates based on the determination of return privileges with vendors  the level of credit provided by the vendor and management s estimate of the discounts to recorded cost  if any  required by market conditions 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
warranty reserves our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims 
merchandise and services sold under warranty  which are not covered by vendors warranties  include batteries  tires  roadside assistance and craftsman products 
we record accruals for future warranty claims based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required 
we have seen positive trends in the defective rates of our batteries sold  which have offset historically higher trends used to develop our battery warranty accrual resulting in overall lower warranty expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
we believe these positive trends are a result of quality enhancements of our currently offered battery line and better policies and procedures surrounding the testing and defecting of batteries by our store personnel 
while we expect these positive trends to continue  an increase in defective rates would have a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
self insured reserves we are self insured for general and automobile liability  workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members 
therefore  we record estimated reserve amounts for the settlement of such claims below our stop loss limits 
these estimates are developed based on information obtained through our claims management procedures  from actual claims reported to us and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
this information is obtained through a collaboration of both our internal and external claims professionals and third party administrators 
the estimated claim cost is actively reviewed for changes in claim facts or action plans and negative trends related to claims incurred but not reported 
accordingly  our estimated reserves may require an adjustment to previously recorded amounts 
restructuring and closed store liabilities we recognize a provision for future obligations at the time a store location closes 
the provision includes future minimum lease payments and common area maintenance and taxes all reduced by management s estimate of potential subleases and lease buyouts 
these estimates are based on current market and our experience of executing subleases or buyouts on similar properties 
however  our inability to enter into the subleases or obtain buyouts due to a change in the economy or prevailing real estate markets for these properties within the estimated timeframe may result in increases or decreases to these reserves and could negatively impact our result of operations and cash flows 
components of statement of operations net sales net sales consist primarily of comparable store sales  new store net sales  and finance charges on installment sales 
comparable store sales is calculated based on the change in net sales starting once a store has been opened for complete accounting periods each accounting period represents four weeks 
relocations are included in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 
our comparable store sales results include the rd week of operation compared to our first week of operation in the comparable calendar week 
stores acquired in the discount acquisition were included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning in december  which was complete accounting periods after the acquisition date of november  we do not include net sales from the western auto retail stores in our comparable store sales calculation as a result of their unique product offerings  including specialty merchandise 
cost of sales our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  net of incentives under vendor programs  and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix  price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs 
we seek to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long term purchasing agreements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll  store occupancy including rent  net advertising expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of corporate team members  administrative office expenses  data processing  professional expenses and other related expenses including expenses associated with merger and integration 
we lease a significant portion of our stores 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended january  december  december  net sales cost of sales expenses associated with supply chain initiatives gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses expense associated with supply chain initiatives impairment of assets held for sale expenses associated with merger and integration expenses associated with merger related restructuring non cash stock option compensation expense operating income interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt expenses associated with secondary offering other income  net income tax expense income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle discontinued operations loss income from operations of discontinued wholesale distribution network benefit provision for income taxes loss income on discontinued operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for were  million  an increase of million  or  over net sales for excluding the effect of the rd week our net sales increased million  or  over net sales for the net sales increase was due to an increase in the comparable store sales of  driven by increases in both customer traffic and average ticket sales  and contributions from new stores opened within the last year 
as previously mentioned  increases in both our diy and difm business contributed to the comparable store sales increase 
gross profit for was  million  or of net sales  as compared to  million  or of net sales  in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects continued benefits realized from our category management initiatives and improved efficiencies in our logistics network 
in  we anticipate our gross profit to continue to improve as a result of the benefits realized from our category management initiatives and leveraging our logistics expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  including merger and integration costs of million in and million in  increased to  million  or of net sales for  from  million  or of net sales for the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily a result of a decrease in merger and integration expenses related to the integration of discount 
these integration expenses are related to  among other things  overlapping administrative functions and store conversion expenses 
the decline in merger and integration costs was anticipated as we near the completion of the discount integration 
excluding the impact of the merger and integration costs  the decline as a percentage of net sales is a result of leveraging our fixed costs with the impact of the rd week of operations in the fourth quarter of interest expense for was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the decrease in interest expense is a result of lower overall interest rates resulting primarily from our redemption of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in first quarter additionally  the decrease is a result of overall lower debt levels in as compared to  due to our use of free cash flow to pay down debt 
income tax expense for was million  as compared to million for our effective income tax rate decreased to for  as compared to  for the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to increases in pre tax income  which reduced the impact of certain permanent differences on the effective rate 
during  we recorded million in a loss on extinguishment of debt 
this loss reflects the write off of deferred loan costs and premiums paid to redeem our senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures during the first quarter of fiscal  and also includes the related financing costs associated with amending our senior credit facility to finance this redemption 
additionally  this loss includes the ratable portion of deferred loans costs associated with the partial repayment of our term loans during fiscal we recorded net income of million  per diluted share for  as compared to million  or per diluted share for as a percentage of sales  net income for was  as compared to for the effect of the expenses associated with merger and integration and loss on extinguishment of debt on net income was million  or per diluted share for and million  or per diluted share for as previously mentioned  these per share amounts reflect the two for one stock split declared in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for were  million  an increase of million  or  over net sales for the net sales increase was due to an increase a full year s contribution of sales from stores acquired in the discount acquisition  in the comparable store sales of and contributions from new stores opened within the last year 
the comparable store sales increase was a result of growth in both the diy and difm market segments indicated by an increase in both comparative customers and average customer sales  as well as the continued maturation of new stores 
gross profit for was  million  or of net sales  as compared to  million  or of net sales  in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects more favorable merchandise costs realized in fiscal as a result of renegotiating merchandise contracts after the discount acquisition 
additionally  this increase represents our ability to leverage logistics costs primarily driven by a review of our logistics operations  which occurred in connection with our supply chain initiatives 
we began these initiatives during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in which we recorded a million charge for restocking and handling fees associated with the return of inventory under these initiatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  million  or of net sales for  from million  or of net sales for selling  general and administrative expenses include merger and integration expenses related to the integration of discount of million  or of sales  and million  or of sales  for and  respectively 
these integration expenses are related to  among other things  merger related restructuring  overlapping administrative functions and store conversion expenses 
the merger related restructuring charges primarily relate to lease costs associated with closed advance auto parts stores in overlapping markets as a result of the discount acquisition 
additionally  selling  general and administrative expenses include charges of million  or of sales  in as detailed below million represents costs of relocating certain equipment held at facilities closed as a result of our supply chain initiatives  million represented the devaluation of property held for sale  and million was related to stock option compensation charges resulting from the elimination of variable provisions in certain of our stock options plans 
excluding the effects of the above merger and integration and other expenses above  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales reflects an approximate basis point reduction related to our ability to leverage our store payroll expenses against a higher sales base  and an approximate basis point reduction from lower rent expense as a result of owning a higher percentage of stores after the discount acquisition 
interest expense for was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in interest expense reflects the overall increase in average borrowings offset by more favorable interest rates during as compared to this increase in borrowings is a result of the additional debt incurred in conjunction with the discount acquisition 
income tax expense for was million  as compared to million for our effective income tax rate decreased to for  as compared to  for the decrease was primarily due to increases in pre tax income  which reduced the impact of certain permanent differences on the effective rate 
during  we recorded million in a loss on extinguishment of debt 
this loss reflects the write off of the ratable portion of the deferred loan costs associated with our partial repayment of our tranche a and tranche b term loans and expenses associated with the refinancing of the remaining portion of our tranche b term loans 
additionally  this loss includes the write off of the ratable portion of deferred loan costs and premiums paid associated with the partial repurchase and retirement of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures 
we recorded net income of million  per diluted share for  as compared to million  or per diluted share for as a percentage of sales  net income for was  as compared to for the effect of the above merger and integration items and loss on extinguishment of debt on net income is million  or per diluted share for the effect of the merger and integration expenses  loss on extinguishment of debt  cumulative effect of a change in accounting policy and other charges as detailed above were million  or per diluted share for as previously mentioned these per share amounts reflect the two for one stock split declared in quarterly financial results unaudited in thousands  except per share data weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended net sales      gross profit      net income       net income per share basic diluted liquidity and capital resources at january   we had outstanding indebtedness consisting of borrowings of million under our senior credit facility 
additionally  we had outstanding borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility and had million in letters of credit outstanding  which reduced our availability under the revolving credit facility to million 
our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program  including new store openings and store acquisitions  store relocations and remodels  inventory requirements  the construction and upgrading of distribution centers  the development and implementation of proprietary information systems and our strategic acquisitions 
we have financed our growth through a combination of cash generated from operations  borrowings under the credit facility and issuances of equity 
our new stores  if leased  require capital expenditures of approximately  per store and an inventory investment of approximately  per store  net of vendor payables 
a portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution facility 
pre opening expenses  consisting primarily of store set up costs and training of new store team members  average approximately  per store and are expensed when incurred 
our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open or acquire and the timing of those openings or acquisitions within a given year 
we opened and new stores during and  respectively  including stores acquired in the trak and carport acquisitions  but excluding stores acquired in the discount acquisition 
in addition  we anticipate adding approximately to new stores during primarily through new store openings 
historically  we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth  and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms 
we anticipate that inventory levels will continue to increase but at a rate lower than anticipated sales growth 
as recently announced  we have launched a vendor factoring program in that will allow us to extend the terms on a portion of our accounts payable with our suppliers  therefore  positively impacting cash flow 
our capital expenditures were million in these amounts related to the new store openings  the upgrade of our information systems  remodels and relocations of existing stores  including our physical conversion of discount stores  and capitalizable store improvements 
in  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million  up from reflecting our intent to own rather than lease a portion of our new store openings 
our recent acquisitions have resulted in restructuring reserves recorded in purchase accounting for the closure of certain stores  severance and relocation costs and other facility exit costs 
in addition  we assumed certain restructuring and deferred compensation liabilities previously recorded by western and discount 
at january   the restructuring reserves had a remaining balance of million  of which million is recorded as a current liability 
additionally  at january   the total liability for the deferred compensation plans was million  of which million  is recorded as a current liability 
the classification for deferred compensation is determined by payment terms elected by plan participants  primarily former western team members  which can be changed upon months notice 
these reserves are utilized through the settlement of the corresponding liabilities with cash provided by operations and therefore do not affect our consolidated statement of operations 
we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team members through our postretirement plan 
at january   our accrued benefit cost related to this plan was million 
the plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paid incurred 
the discount rate that we utilize for determining our postretirement benefit obligation is actuarilly determined 
the discount rate utilized at january  and december  was and  respectively 
we reserve the right to change or terminate the benefits or contributions at any time 
we also continue to evaluate ways in which we can better manage these benefits and control costs 
any changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation and annual expense 
effective december  we amended the plan to only provide benefits for team members who are eligible at january  this negative plan amendment resulted in a curtailment gain of million in  which is being amortized over years to offset corresponding increases in health care cost trends 
we expect that funds provided from operations and available borrowings of approximately million under our revolving credit facility at january   will provide sufficient funds to operate our business  make expected capital expenditures of approximately million in  finance our restructuring activities and fund future debt service on our senior credit facility through the next three years 
for  net cash provided by operating activities was million

our future contractual obligations related to long term debt and operating leases at january  were as follows contractual obligations at january  total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter in thousands long term debt     operating leases     other long term liabilities  we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements 
primarily includes employee benefits accruals  restructuring and closed store liabilities and deferred income taxes for which no contractual payment schedule exists 
long term debt senior credit facility 
in march  we added incremental facilities under our senior credit facility in the form of a tranche a term loan facility of million and tranche c term loan facility of million to fund the redemption of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in april additionally in december  we refinanced the remaining portion of our tranche a  a  c and c term loan facilities under the previous senior credit facility by amending and restating the credit facility to add a new million tranche d term loan facility and million tranche e term loan facility 
in fiscal  we repaid million of total debt 
at january   our senior credit facility consisted of a tranche d term loan facility with a balance of approximately million and a tranche e term loan facility with a balance of approximately million  and a million revolving credit facility including a letter of credit sub facility of which million was available 
the credit facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries including discount and its subsidiaries and is secured by all of our assets and the assets of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries including discount and its subsidiaries 
the tranche d term loan facility currently provides for amortization of million on november   million in may and november and in may and million at maturity on november  the tranche e term loan facility currently provides for amortization of million in november  and semi annually thereafter  with a final payment of million due at maturity on november  the interest rates on the tranche d and e term loan facilities are based  at our option  on an adjusted libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
until our delivery of our financial statements for the fiscal year ending on january   the initial margins for the tranche d and e term loan facilities are and per annum for the adjusted libor rate and alternate base rate borrowings  respectively 
the margins after such date will be determined by a pricing grid based on our leverage ratio at that time 
at january   interest rates on our tranche d and e term loan facilities were and  respectively 
the interest rates on the revolving credit facility are based  at our option  on either an adjusted libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin

the senior credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all  subject to certain exceptions  of our assets and the assets of our existing domestic subsidiaries including discount and its subsidiaries and will be secured by the properties and assets of our future domestic subsidiaries 
the senior credit facility contains covenants restricting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to  among other things  declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  prepay  redeem or purchase debt  incur liens or engage in sale leaseback transactions  make loans and investments  incur additional debt including hedging arrangements  engage in certain mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  engage in transactions with affiliates  change the nature of our business and the business conducted by our subsidiaries and change our passive holding company status 
we are also required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a a maximum leverage ratio  b a minimum interest coverage ratio  c a minimum current assets to funded senior debt ratio  d a maximum senior leverage ratio and e limits on capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with the above covenants of the senior credit facility at january  seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months 
in addition  our business can be affected by weather conditions 
while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods  extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail

in september as subsequently updated in november  the fasb released eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
this eitf addresses how a reseller should account for consideration received from a vendor since eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  only addresses the accounting treatment from the vendor s perspective 
the consensus is that cash received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the vendor s products or services and should  therefore  be characterized as a reduction in the cost of sales when recognized in the customer s income statement  unless a reimbursement of costs is incurred by the customer to sell the vendor s products  in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost when recognized in the customer s income statement 
additionally  any rebate or refund should also be recognized as a reduction of the cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation 
the release is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  our current accounting policy for vendor incentives meets the requirements of this eitf and therefore the adoption of this release during the first quarter of fiscal had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation  or fin  no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no

it also clarifies that  under certain circumstances  a guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation at the inception of the guarantee 
certain types of guarantees  such as product warranties  guarantees accounted for as derivatives  and guarantees related to parent subsidiary relationships are excluded from the liability recognition provisions of fin no 
 however  they are subject to the disclosure requirements 
the initial liability recognition provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of interpretation no 
are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december  we have no guarantees of third party indebtedness and therefore the adoption of fin no 
during the first quarter of fiscal had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
additionally  we have complied with the disclosure aspect of fin no 
as it relates to warranties 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no

this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
interpretation no 
is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
the interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we do not have interests in variable interest entities  therefore  the adoption of interpretation no 
had no impact on our financial position or results of operations

in july as subsequently updated in november  the fasb released eitf issue no 
 application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to customers by manufacturers 
this eitf addresses whether a reseller should account for consideration received from a vendor that is a reimbursement by the vendor for honoring the vendor s sales incentives offered directly to consumers in accordance with the guidance in eitf issue no 
for purposes of this issue  the vendor s sales incentive offered directly to consumers is limited to a vendor s incentive i that can be tendered by a consumer at resellers that accept manufacturer s incentives in partial or full of the price charged by the reseller for the vendor s product  ii for which the reseller receives a direct reimbursement from the vendor or a clearinghouse authorized by the vendor based on the face amount of the incentive  iii for which the terms of reimbursement to the reseller for the vendor s sales incentive offered to the consumer must not be influenced by or negotiated in conjunction with any other incentive arrangements between the vendor and the reseller but  rather may only be determined by the terms of the incentive offered to consumers and iv whereby the reseller is subject to an agency relationship with the vendor  whether expressed or implied  in the sales incentive transaction between the vendor and the consumer 
the consensus is that sales incentives that meet all of such criteria are not subject to the guidance in issue no 
the release is effective for fiscal periods beginning after november  the company does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations

risk factors risks relating to our business we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful 
we have increased our store count significantly from  stores at the end of to  stores at january  we intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of our growth strategy  primarily by opening new stores 
there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors  including  among other things  our ability to manage the expansion and hire  train and retain qualified sales associates  the availability of potential store locations in highly visible  well trafficked areas and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms for new locations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales 
the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on our ability to properly merchandise  market and price the products required in their respective markets 
furthermore  we may acquire or try to acquire stores or businesses from  make investments in  or enter into strategic alliances with  companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence 
any future acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks  including the difficulty of identifying appropriate acquisition candidates  the difficulty of assimilating and integrating the operations of the respective entities  the potential disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management s attention  the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and the impairment of relationships with team members and customers as a result of changes in management 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts 
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy  including increasing comparable store sales  enhancing our margins and increasing our return on capital  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales  enhance our margins and increase our return on capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow 
if these initiatives are unsuccessful  or if we are unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
successful implementation of our growth strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control 
these include adverse changes in general economic conditions and conditions in our local markets  which could reduce our sales  the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices or increase spending  the automotive aftermarket parts manufacturing industry  such as consolidation  which may disrupt or sever one or more of our vendor relationships  our ability to anticipate and meet changes in consumer preferences for automotive products  accessories and services in a timely manner  and our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  which depends in part on the types of recruiting  training and benefit programs we adopt 
disruptions in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors operations could increase our cost of goods sold 
our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and upon the vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and other terms 
many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms 
for example  financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them 
in addition  the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or sever our relationship with some vendors  and could lead to less competition and  consequently  higher prices 
if demand for products sold by our stores slows  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for a number of reasons  including the weather  as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of inclement weather  the economy  as during periods of good economic conditions  more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own cars 
in periods of declining economic conditions  both diy and difm customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair  and the decline of the average age of vehicles  miles driven or number of cars on the road may indicate a reduction in the demand for our product offerings 
if any of these factors cause demand for the products we sell to decline  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
we depend on the services of our existing management team and may not be able to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executive officers and senior management team 
if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management  our business could suffer 
we have entered into employment agreements with some of our executive officers and senior management  however  these agreements do not ensure their continued employment with us 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain additional qualified senior executives as needed in the future  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
the sale of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas  including price  name recognition  customer service and location 
we compete primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains  wholesalers or jobber stores  independent operators  automobile dealers that supply parts  discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts  accessories and maintenance items 
some of our competitors possess advantages over us  including substantially greater financial and marketing resources  a larger number of stores  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger and more established customer bases and more established vendor relationships 
our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices or increase our spending  which would lower revenue and profitability 
competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies 
if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
because we are involved in litigation from time to time  and are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations  we could incur substantial judgments  fines  legal fees and other costs 
we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers  employees or other third parties for various actions 
in particular  we are currently involved in litigation involving claims relating to  among other things  breach of contract  anti competitive behavior  tortious conduct  employment discrimination  asbestos exposure and product defect 
the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial 
although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims  if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim  it could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 
additionally  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to employment matters  environmental protection and building and zoning requirements 
if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions 
in addition  our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these or future laws or regulations 
risks relating to our financial condition our level of debt and restrictions in our debt instruments may limit our ability to take certain actions  including obtaining additional financing in the future  that we would otherwise consider in our best interest 
at january   we had total debt of approximately million 
our debt levels could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could impair our ability to implement our growth strategy  impair our ability to obtain additional financing  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes in the future  place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt  restrict our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions  increase our vulnerability to adverse economic  industry and business conditions  or cause our interest expense to increase if interest rates in general were to increase because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at a floating rate 
our ability to service our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our operations may not generate the amount of cash we need 
we will need a significant amount of cash to service our debt 
our ability to generate cash depends on our successful financial and operating performance 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations 
our financial and operational performance also depends upon a number of other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include economic and competitive conditions in the automotive aftermarket industry  and operating difficulties  operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience 
if we are unable to service our debt  we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  refinancing or restructuring our debt or raising additional equity capital 
however  we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible or prove adequate 
also  some alternative strategies would require the consent of at least a majority in interest of the lenders under our senior credit facility and we can provide no assurances that we would be able to obtain this consent 
if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and alternative strategies are unsuccessful or unavailable  our lenders would be entitled to exercise various remedies  including foreclosing on our assets 
under those circumstances  our investors may lose all or a portion of their investments 
the covenants governing our debt impose significant restrictions on us 
the terms of our amended senior credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests 
these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions  including incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness  paying dividends or making distributions or certain other restricted payments  making capital expenditures and other investments  creating liens on our assets  issuing or selling capital stock of our subsidiaries  transferring or selling assets currently held by us  repurchasing stock and certain indebtedness  engaging in transactions with affiliates  entering into any agreements that restrict dividends from our subsidiaries  engaging in mergers or consolidations 
the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our senior credit facility 
furthermore  our senior credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including establishing a maximum leverage ratio and requiring us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a funded senior debt to current assets ratio  which  if not maintained by us  will cause us to be in default under our senior credit facility 
any of these defaults  if not waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our debt  in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable 
if this occurs  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if new financing were available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our long term debt 
while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt  exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of fixed and variable rate debt and hedging activities 
our variable rate debt is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate 
our future exposure to interest rate risk increased during due to the addition of variable rate debt and redemption of our fixed rate senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures  all offset by decreased interest rates  a reduction in overall debt levels and the addition of two interest rate swaps 
in march  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of million of our variable rate debt under our senior credit facility 
the first swap allows us to fix our libor rate at on million of variable rate debt for a term of months 
the second swap allows us to fix our libor rate at on million of variable rate debt for a term of months 
in september  we entered into a hedge agreement in the form of a zero cost collar  which protects us against interest rate fluctuations in the libor rate on million of our variable rate debt under our senior credit facility 
the collar consists of an interest rate ceiling of and an interest floor of for a term of months 
under this hedge  we will continue to pay interest at prevailing rates plus any spread  as defined by our credit facility  but will be reimbursed for any amounts paid on the libor rate in excess of the ceiling 
conversely  we will be required to pay the financial institution that originated the collar if the libor rate is less than the floor 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our long term debt outstanding at january   by expected maturity dates 
additionally  the table includes the notional amounts of our debt hedged and the impact of the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our hedges through their maturity dates 
expected maturity dates approximate contract terms 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at january   as adjusted by the limitations of the hedge agreement 
implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates
