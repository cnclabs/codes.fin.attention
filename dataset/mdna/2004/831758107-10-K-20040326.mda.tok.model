item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this annual report on form k 
references contained herein to  and mean the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
general as of december   we operated high end  high volume restaurants in the united states 
we believe that the particularly large size of the markets we entered warranted investment in restaurants with seating capacities ranging from to in january  we opened a seat smith wollensky in houston  texas 
we expect to open another smith wollensky restaurant in late in boston  massachusetts 
we expect the restaurant in boston to have approximately seats on four levels 
although we currently do not have any leases signed other than leases relating to our existing and planned locations and will not actively pursue new locations in  we would consider opening a new smith wollensky restaurant in a high caliber location under highly favorable investment terms 
we plan to move ahead cautiously with our future expansion as management evaluates and monitors economic and security conditions  and we expect to resume our new restaurant growth in we expect additional locations to have seating capacities ranging from to seats  but would consider locations with larger seating capacities where appropriate 
we believe these new restaurants will require  on average  a total cash investment of million to million net of landlord contributions and excluding pre opening expenses 
this range assumes that the property on which the new unit is located is being leased and is dependent on the size of the location and the amount of the landlord contribution 
although our newest unit in houston falls within this range  the restaurant we plan to open in boston is expected to significantly exceed this range primarily because of its size 
some locations that we choose will be outside our preferred cash investment range  but are nevertheless accepted based on our evaluation of the potential returns 
as a result of our recent expansion and when our locations opened  period to period comparisons of our financial results may not be meaningful 
when a new restaurant opens  we typically incur higher than normal levels of food and labor costs as a percentage of sales during the first year of its operation 
average sales for our ten owned units open for all of were million 
in calculating comparable restaurant sales  we introduce a restaurant into our comparable restaurant base once it has been in operation for months 
pursuant to management contracts and arrangements  we operate  but do not own  the original smith wollensky  maloney porcelli  the post house and onecps restaurants in new york and the mrs 
parks tavern in chicago

restaurant operating expenses include operating supplies  utilities  maintenance and repairs and other operating expenses 
occupancy and related expenses include rent  real estate taxes and other occupancy costs 
management fee income relates to fees that we receive from our managed units 
these fees are based on a percentage of sales from the managed units  ranging from to 
management fee income also includes fees from maloney porcelli equal to of the unit s net operating cash flow generated during each fiscal year  provided that the maloney porcelli owner receives a minimum amount of operating cash flow per year ranging from  to  prior to december  we operated park avenue caf in chicago  mrs 
park s tavern and the other services of the food and beverage department of doubletree pursuant to the doubletree agreement 
we received a management fee equal to the sum of of sales and a percentage of earnings  as defined 
the doubletree agreement was to expire on the earlier of december  or the termination of the related hotel management agreement between hsr  the owner of the doubletree and doubletree partners  the manager of the doubletree 
during december  hsr closed the park avenue caf restaurant in chicago and discontinued our requirement to provide other food and beverage department service for the doubletree 
as a result  we no longer receive the fees described above 
during the three month period ended march   we reached an agreement with hsr 
the agreement provides for the continued use by hsr of the name mrs 
parks tavern and requires us to provide management services to support that location 
in exchange for the use of the mrs 
park s tavern name and related management support the company receives an annual fee of  the agreement will automatically renew each year  unless notification of cancellation is given  by either party  at least days prior to december management fee income also could include fees from onecps equal to of the restaurant s operating cash flows  if any  as reduced by the repayment of project costs and working capital contributions 
after all the project costs and working capital contributions have been repaid  the fee will increase to of the restaurant s operating cash flows 
on december   we amended the agreement with plaza operating partners 
effective january   plaza operating partners agreed to pay us  per quarter as a minimum base management fee 
the minimum base management fee will be credited against any management fee that we earn under the agreement 
this amendment also gives either party the right to fund or refuse to fund any necessary working capital requirements 
if neither party is willing to fund the required additional working capital contributions  as defined  then either party may terminate the agreement 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing owned and managed operations and provide infrastructure to our organization 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  travel costs  information systems  training costs  corporate rent  corporate insurance and professional and consulting fees 
pre opening costs incurred in connection with the opening of new restaurants are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses also include the depreciation of corporate level property and equipment and the amortization of corporate intangible assets  such as licensing agreements and management contracts 
royalty expense represents fees paid pursuant to a licensing agreement with st 
james associates  based upon of sales  as defined  for restaurants utilizing the smith wollensky name 
wherever we refer to a particular year  we refer to our or week fiscal year ending on the monday nearest december  unless otherwise noted 
fiscal years ended december   december  and december  each consisted of week periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  income tax valuation allowances and legal proceedings 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that can not readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales from owned restaurants are recognized as revenue at the point of the delivery of meals and services 
management fee income is recognized as the related management fee is earned pursuant to the respective agreements 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from credit card processing companies or individuals that have good historical track records of payment 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  from  in to  in the net increase in the allowance was for additional uncollectible house accounts determined by conducting a specific review of major account balances and by applying statistical experience factors to the various aging categories of receivable balances 
we decreased the allowance for doubtful accounts by  from to the decrease consisted of a direct write off of the  reserve relating to our management contract  partially offset by a  net increase for additional uncollectible house accounts 
long lived assets we review long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by restaurant comparing the carrying amount of the restaurant s assets to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by such assets 
we limit assumptions about such factors as sales and margin improvements to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit  its individual results and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value would be calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of fair value of certain reporting units acquired in the formation of the company over the book value of those reporting units identifiable net assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
also requires that intangibles assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the recoverability of goodwill at the end of each year through a fair value evaluation performed for each reporting unit that has goodwill 
the fair value valuation is calculated using various methods  including an analysis based on projected discounted future operating cash flows of each reporting unit using a discount rate reflecting our average cost of funds 
we limit assumptions about such factors as sales and margin improvements to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are negatively modified by us as a result of changes in economic conditions  significant events that occur or other factors arising after the preparation of any previous analysis 
we recorded an impairment of goodwill of  during related to our mrs 
parks management company reporting unit 
this impairment related to lower than anticipated future cash flow for us from the closing by the hotel owner of the park avenue caf restaurant in chicago 
for the remainder of our reporting units with goodwill  the fair value is in excess of the recorded carrying value 
the net carrying value of goodwill as of december  and december  was million 
other intangible assets we review other intangible assets  which include costs attributable to a sale and licensing agreement and the cost of the acquisition of management contracts  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of our intangible assets will be assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected net cash flows to be generated by such assets 
an intangible asset would be considered impaired if the sum of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the book value of the assets generating those cash flows 
we limit assumptions about such factors as sales and margin improvements to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if intangible assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized will be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value would be calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the assessment of the recoverability of these intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are negatively modified by us as a result of changes in economic conditions  significant events that occur or other factors arising after the preparation of any previous analysis 
during  we determined that the carrying amount of the management contract and receivable from the onecps restaurant was not recoverable and an impairment had occurred 
we recorded a one time charge for investment in managed restaurants of  in the third quarter of  which consisted of a  charge against the net investment in the management contract and a  charge against the receivable 
for the remainder of our other intangible assets  the fair value is in excess of the recorded carrying value 
the net carrying value of these intangible assets as of december  and december  was million 
artwork we purchase artwork and antiques for display in our restaurants 
we do not depreciate artwork and antiques since these assets have cultural  aesthetic or historical value that is worth preserving perpetually and we have the ability and intent to protect and preserve these assets 
such assets are recorded at cost and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the net carrying value of our artwork as of december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
self insurance liability we are self insured for our employee health program 
we maintain stop loss insurance to limit our total exposure and individual claims 
the liability associated with this program is based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical medical claim patterns and known economic conditions 
if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
however  we believe that a change in our current accrual requirement of or less would cause a change of approximately  to our financial results 
legal proceedings we are involved in various claims and legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some actions  the claimants seek damages  which  if granted  would require significant expenditures 
we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate  the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if a loss is not remote and can be reasonably estimated  a liability is recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes and income tax valuation allowances we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes and estimates related to the ultimate realization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
at december   we have recorded a valuation allowance of million to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of million and other timing differences of million to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in federal and certain state jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage 
the estimation of future taxable income for federal and state purposes and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events and operating results 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes

in october  we purchased an existing restaurant in dallas  texas and converted it into a smith wollensky restaurant 
the purchase price for the property  including acres of land  was million 
part of the purchase price was financed through a million promissory note from the owner 
the property  which is located in the north dallas area  has an approximately  square foot building with a seating capacity of we opened the restaurant on march  on january   we opened our newest smith wollensky unit in houston  texas 
other cash provided by used in in investing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the sale of investments of million for the year ended december   net purchases of investments of million for the year ended december  and net purchases of investments of million for the year ended december  total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in and will be used to complete the construction of our new restaurants in houston  texas and boston  massachusetts  and for general maintenance of existing restaurants 
in january we opened a seat smith wollensky in houston  texas 
we expect to open another smith wollensky restaurant in late in boston  massachusetts 
we expect the restaurant to have approximately seats on four levels 
although we currently do not have any leases signed other than leases relating to our existing and planned locations and will not actively pursue new locations in  we would consider opening a new smith wollensky restaurant in a high caliber location under highly favorable investment terms 
we plan to move ahead cautiously with our future expansion as management evaluates and monitors economic and security conditions  and we expect to resume our new restaurant growth in as of december   the average cost of opening the last three smith wollensky restaurants  net of landlord contributions  has been approximately million  excluding the purchase of land and pre opening costs 
we expect additional locations to have seating capacities ranging from to seats  but would consider locations with larger seating capacities where appropriate 
we intend to develop restaurants that will require  on average  a total cash investment of million to million net of landlord contributions and excluding pre opening costs 
this range assumes that the property on which the new unit is located is being leased and is dependent on the size of the location and the amount of the landlord contribution 
although our newest unit in houston falls within this range  the restaurant we plan to open in boston is expected to significantly exceed this range primarily because of its size 
some locations that we choose will be outside our preferred cash investment range  but are nevertheless accepted based on our evaluation of the potential returns 
in  we assumed certain liabilities from two bankrupt corporations in connection with the acquisition of our lease for the smith wollensky in miami 
pursuant to the terms of the bankruptcy resolution  we are obligated to make quarterly and annual payments over a six year period

on march   we signed a first amendment to covenants agreement with morgan stanley dean witter commercial financial services  inc the amendment increased to  the amount that we may exclude from the determination of any of our covenants  under our term loans and line of credit facility  as a result of the tentative settlement of the legal dispute between the company and mondo s 
during  we incurred a net loss of million  primarily related to the costs incurred for litigation and tentative settlement on a disputed lease matter and the costs incurred for the opening of a new restaurant in dallas 
we used cash during primarily for the purchase of property and equipment at our dallas location and our houston location 
while we generated cash from operating activities of million for the year ended december   cash of million and million was used for investing and financing activities  respectively  leaving us with cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as of december  we currently project capital expenditures totaling approximately million during  primarily related to the completion of the new restaurant in houston and the planned restaurant in boston  which is scheduled for opening late in the houston location was opened in january we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures to complete this project during the first quarter of because of these developments  we obtained a million secured line of credit described above and borrowed approximately million in the first quarter of we also commenced discussions with two commercial lenders for additional financing that we intend to finalize during the second quarter of we received a letter of intent from one of the lenders for additional funding totaling million 
we are renegotiating with the second commercial lender the mortgage related to the miami restaurant property  which has a final principal payment of  due in june we intend to refinance and extend the payment schedule for this mortgage  and add an additional million of debt to this facility 
the current loan agreements  including the new secured line of credit agreement  permit us to borrow additional funds up to million 
we believe that our cash and short term investments on hand  funds received under the new million secured line of credit facility  projected cash flow from operations  expected landlord construction contributions and the anticipated financing arrangements should be sufficient to finance our planned capital expenditures and operations throughout  as well as allow us to meet our debt service obligations under our loan agreements 
our cash resources  and therefore our liquidity  are dependent upon the level of internally generated cash from operations and upon the anticipated financing transactions described above 
the inability to finalize the two new loan agreements in the second quarter of  changes in our operating plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  or other events would cause us to seek alternative financing or cease our capital expenditure plans as early as june while we would seek to obtain additional funds through commercial borrowings or the private or public issuance of debt or equity securities  there can be no assurance that such funds would be available when needed or be available on terms acceptable to us
