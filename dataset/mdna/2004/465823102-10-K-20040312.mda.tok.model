we also have subsidiaries located throughout the world  some of which are among the leading pharmaceutical companies in their markets 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  overview we generated strong revenue growth in principally due to increased demand and higher prices in all regions 
our revenue growth was also driven by new product launches and the acquisition of businesses 
the year ended december   was a year of investment in our future 
we invested million  an increase of  more in sales and marketing than in and million  an increase of  more in research and development than in despite these investments  our operating income increased by from million in to million in we expect to continue to make significant investments in capital expenditures to increase our manufacturing capacity  in sales and marketing and in research and development

as part of our ongoing business strategy  we enter into collaborative alliances  which allow us to exploit our drug discovery and development capabilities or provide us with intellectual property and technologies 
many of these alliances involve licenses to other companies relating to technologies or compounds under development and  in some cases  finished products 
these licenses permit us to reduce our development costs and often involve the receipt of an up front payment and fees upon completion of certain development milestones and also  generally  provide for royalties based on sales of the products 
we have received significant payments in the past from these arrangements 
we expect that milestone  developmental  royalty and other payments under existing and new collaboration and license agreements with other parties will continue to be an important part of our business 
for example  we expect to receive a milestone payment of up to million under a collaboration agreement  which will be recognized as other revenue in the first or second quarter of  based on satisfaction of certain conditions 
our future net revenues and profits will depend and will fluctuate from period to period  in part  based upon our ability to replace or 
table of contents renew license fees  royalties and development service fees as the related agreements expire or are terminated 
we expect that our future net revenues and profits will also depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain fda approval of our manufacturing facilities  our ability to maintain a pipeline of products in development  our ability to achieve the milestones specified in our license and development agreements  our ability to manufacture  obtain and maintain a sufficient supply of products to meet market demand  retain our customers and meet contractual deadlines and terms  our ability to develop and rapidly introduce new products and to introduce existing products into new territories  the timing of regulatory approval of such products  the availability and cost of raw materials required to manufacture such products  our ability to manufacture such products efficiently  the number and timing of regulatory approvals of competing products  the outcome and timing of legal proceedings  particularly those related to hatch waxman exclusivity and patent infringement cases  our ability to forecast inventory levels and trends at our customers and their end customers  and our and our competitors pricing and chargeback policies

in addition  during we recorded million of tax effect of prior years stock option exercises 
these amounts were credited to capital in excess of par value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we recognized million in of united states taxable income on the intercompany assignment of a contract 
for financial reporting purposes this transaction was eliminated in consolidation 
valuation allowances previously recorded against the foreign and domestic net deferred tax assets of million in  million in and million in were reversed due to management s expectation of increased domestic taxable income in the coming year 
the domestic net deferred tax asset was million at december   and million at december   and the aggregate net deferred tax asset in foreign countries was million at december   and million at december  as of december and  the domestic deferred tax asset was not reserved 
as of december   the aggregate foreign net deferred tax asset was approximately reserved 
realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future domestic and foreign taxable income 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
our estimates of future taxable income are subject to revision due to  among other things  regulatory and competitive factors affecting the pharmaceutical industries in the markets in which we operate 
our future effective tax rate will depend on the mix between foreign and domestic taxable income or losses and the statutory tax rates of the related tax jurisdictions 
the mix between our foreign and domestic taxable income may be significantly affected by the jurisdiction in which new products are developed and manufactured 

table of contents income from ivax pharmaceuticals puerto rico manufacturing operations is subject to certain tax exemptions under the terms of a grant from the puerto rican government  which will expire on january  the grant reduced tax expense by approximately million in  million in and million in under the terms of the grant  ivax pharmaceuticals is required to maintain certain employment levels 
we have historically received a united states tax credit under section of the internal revenue code for certain income generated by our puerto rico and virgin islands operations 
these credits were approximately million in  million for and million for and offset the united states tax liability of such operations 
in  the section tax credit began to be phased out over four years 
risk of product liability claims testing  manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products subject us to the risk of product liability claims 
we are a defendant in a number of product liability cases  none of which we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we believe that we maintain an adequate amount of product liability insurance  but there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all existing and future claims or that we will be able to maintain existing coverage or obtain additional coverage at reasonable rates 
there can be no assurance that claims arising under any pending or future product liability cases  whether or not covered by insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ivax corporation and all majority owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we periodically evaluate estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements and make changes on a prospective basis when adjustments are necessary 
significant estimates include amounts for accounts receivable exposures  deferred tax asset allowances  inventory reserves  environmental reserves  litigation and sales returns and allowances  including  but not limited to  chargebacks  rebates  returns and shelf stock adjustments  and the useful lives of intangible assets 
as a result of our recent return  customer inventory experience  analysis of allowance for doubtful accounts and tax reserves  our estimates of product returns and other sales allowances  inventory obsolescence  allowance for doubtful accounts and income tax exposures decreased and  accordingly  we recognized increased net revenues  reduced cost of sales  reduced bad debt expense and reduced income tax provision during during the year ended december   these changes increased net revenues by million  reduced cost of sales by million  reduced bad debt expense by million  reduced the income tax provision by million  increased net income by million and increased diluted earnings per share by 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances revenues and the related cost of sales are recognized at the time title to our products and the risks and rewards of ownership passes to our customers 
our pharmaceutical revenues are affected by the level of provisions for estimated returns  inventory credits  discounts  promotional allowances  rebates  chargebacks  reimbursements relating to medicaid and medicare and other allowances 
the custom in the united states pharmaceutical industry is 
table of contents generally to grant customers the right to return purchased goods 
in the generic pharmaceutical industry  this custom has resulted in a practice of suppliers issuing inventory credits also known as shelf stock adjustments to customers based on the customers existing inventory following decreases in the market price of the related generic pharmaceutical product 
we have contractual agreements with many of our customers  which require that we grant these customers inventory credit following a price decrease 
in other cases  the determination to grant a credit to a customer following a price decrease is at our discretion 
these credits allow customers with established inventories to compete with those buying product at the current market price  and allow us to maintain shelf space  market share and customer loyalty 
provisions for estimated returns  inventory credits and chargebacks  as well as other sales allowances  are established by us concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the provisions are established in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including actual return and inventory credit experience for products during the past several years  the number and timing of regulatory approvals for the product by our competitors both historical and projected  the market for the product  expected sell through levels by our wholesale customers to customers with contractual pricing arrangements with us  estimated customer inventory levels and projected economic conditions 
actual product returns and inventory credits incurred are  however  dependent upon future events  including remaining shelf life and price competition and the level of customer inventories at the time of any price decreases 
we continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and customer inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe that actual product returns  inventory credits and other allowances may differ from established reserves 
royalty and license fee income are recognized when obligations associated with earning the royalty or licensing fee have been satisfied and are included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  our accounting policy is to review each contract to determine if there are multiple revenue generating activities that constitute more than one unit of accounting 
revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting based on revenue recognition criteria relevant to that unit 
up front payments are deferred  if appropriate  and recognized into revenues over the obligation period 
gain on sale of product rights during  we entered into an agreement to sell to omp certain rights in elmiron 
the agreement required an up front payment  as well as milestones and royalties on sales of elmiron 
a portion of the up front and milestone payments that we have received and included in other income in prior years  million as of january   is refundable through december   and then ratably decreases through  if our patent rights are found to be invalid and a brand equivalent of elmiron is introduced by another company 
we believe that the probability of occurrence of our patent rights being found invalid and a brand equivalent of elmiron being introduced by another company is remote  because substantially all agreements for the sale and licensing of a product contain representations and warranties by the seller that the underlying patent is valid 
elmiron possesses strong patent protection and exclusive use legal protections and elmiron s current and expected future market size makes it uneconomical for another company to incur the substantial cost to develop a generic equivalent  perform the long fda clinical trials and litigate with omp and us to obtain generic status 
if the patent were to be challenged  then we  as the owner of the patent rights  would be entitled to a month statutory delay  during which we would maintain exclusive right to sell elmiron 
the active ingredient for elmiron is manufactured by only one source in the world and is subject to a know how license held by us and because of the unique aspects of elmiron  we believe that there is no reliable means for a competitor to demonstrate the bio equivalence that would be required for approval of a potential generic 
the potential refund represents a warranty provision  which is not inconsistent with representations and warranties typically without 
table of contents quantification of damages that are present in most sales and licensing agreements 
when conducting our analysis of the amount to record of the warranty obligation  we first assessed the chance of an adverse outcome under the warranty arrangement 
since we determined the chance of an adverse outcome to be remote  no provision for the warranty was recorded 
during the fourth quarter of  we received million in connection with certain amendments to the contract 
upon acquisition of alza by omp  representatives of omp made it clear to us that they believed that the existing royalty structure  which provided for escalating royalties at certain sales levels  created a disincentive towards the continued growth of and their investment in the product 
in order to address these issues  in exchange for minimum guaranteed royalties through  we agreed to forego our rights to receive increased royalty payments upon sales of elmiron by omp beyond certain sales levels and reduced the royalty rates we would receive at other sales levels 
we also provided for the orderly transition of the manufacture of elmiron to omp 
as the million payment was nonrefundable and since we have no other obligations under the agreement other than those related to the manufacture of elmiron on fair market terms  we determined that the million up front payment is the culmination of a separate earnings process and recorded the payment as additional proceeds from the sale of elmiron to omp 
we will continue to receive payments from omp over the next several years based upon sales of elmiron by omp 
royalty and milestone payments from the sale of rights in elmiron and certain other urology products in the united states and canada to omp totaled million in  million in and million in and are included in other income as additional gain on the sale of product rights 
royalties and milestone payments receivable from omp included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets totaled million at december   million at december   and million at december  inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
components of inventory cost include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  we consider such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life of the inventory and current market price of the inventory 
we have made  are in the process of making and or will scale up and make commercial quantities of certain of our product candidates prior to the date we anticipate that such products will receive final fda or foreign governmental marketing approval and or satisfactory resolution of patent infringement litigation involving them ie  pre launch inventory 
the scale up and commercial production of pre launch inventories involves the risk that such products may not be approved for marketing by the governmental agencies on a timely basis  or ever  and or that the outcome of related litigation may not be satisfactory 
this risk notwithstanding  we plan to continue to scale up and build pre launch inventories of certain products that have not yet received final governmental approval and or satisfactory resolution of patent infringement litigation when we believe that such action is appropriate in relation to the commercial value of the product launch opportunity 
as of december   we had approximately million of inventories related to certain products pending final approval and or satisfactory resolution of litigation 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may require revision or that the remaining net book value may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an asset may be impaired  we use various methods to estimate the asset s future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the asset 
any impairment amount is charged to operations 

table of contents intangible assets intangible assets with definite lives are amortized and carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are carried at cost  are not amortized and are tested for impairment annually 
no impairments were identified during sale of subsidiary stock during  we elected income statement recognition as our accounting policy for sales of subsidiary stock and recorded a gain of million related to the merger of ivax diagnostics with bbstores 
com  which is included in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
legal costs legal charges are recorded for the costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with litigation and claims against us when we can reasonably estimate these costs 
we intend to vigorously defend each of the lawsuits described in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  but their respective outcomes cannot be predicted 
any of such lawsuits or investigations  if determined adversely to us  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our ultimate liability with respect to any of these proceedings is not presently determinable 
we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  some of which involve substantial amounts 
in order to obtain brand equivalent approvals prior to the expiration of patents on branded products  and to benefit from the exclusivity allowed to abbreviated new drug application applicants that successfully challenge these patents  we frequently become involved in patent infringement litigation brought by branded pharmaceutical companies 
although these lawsuits involve products that are not yet marketed and therefore pose little or no risk of liability for damages  the legal fees and costs incurred in defending such litigation can be substantial 
while it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome or the total cost of these proceedings  in our opinion  based on a review with legal counsel  any losses resulting from such legal proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we  in the normal course of doing business  are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have subsidiaries in more than countries worldwide 
during  sales outside the united states accounted for approximately of our worldwide sales 
the majority of these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country 
as such  our reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates 
if the united states dollar weakens relative to the foreign currency  the earnings generated in the foreign currency will  in effect  increase when converted into united states dollars and vice versa 
although we do not speculate in the foreign exchange market  we do from time to time manage exposures that arise in the normal course of business related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into offsetting positions through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
as a result of exchange rate differences  net revenues increased by million in as compared to and decreased by million in compared to the effects of inflation on consolidated net revenues and operating income were not significant 
certain firmly committed transactions are hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts 
as exchange rates change  gains and losses on the exposed transactions are partially offset by gains and losses related to the hedging contracts 
both the exposed transactions and the hedging contracts are translated at current spot rates  with gains and losses included in earnings 
our derivative activities  which primarily consist of foreign exchange forward contracts  are initiated primarily to hedge forecasted cash flows that are exposed to foreign currency risk 
the foreign 
table of contents exchange forward contracts generally require us to exchange local currencies for foreign currencies based on pre established exchange rates at the contracts maturity dates 
if the counterparties to the exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies  we could be at risk for currency related fluctuations 
we enter into these contracts with counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy and do not enter into any leveraged derivative transactions 
we had million at december   and million at december   in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  primarily to hedge euro based operating cash flows against pounds sterling 
as exchange rates change  gains and losses on these contracts are generated based on the change in the exchange rates that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at maturity  and offset the impact of the change in exchange rates on the foreign currency cash flows that are hedged 
as of december   we had million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  of which million related to united states dollar denominated bank loans of million of our argentine based subsidiary  ivax argentina 
the million of bank loans were repaid in january resulting in a pretax loss of million 
interest rate risk our only material debt obligations relate to the  and convertible notes  which bear fixed rates of interest  and the amounts we owe for the purchase of qvar and other respiratory products  which carry no stated interest rate 
we believe that our exposure to market risk relating to interest rate risk is not material
