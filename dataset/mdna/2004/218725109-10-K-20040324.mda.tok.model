table of contents gross profit as a percentage of revenues improved to in  as compared to and in and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues during  as compared to  was mainly due to the increase in sales of additional licenses to existing customers and the million of gross profit recognized during from projects on which corillian had used the zero profit methodology for revenue recognition 
this increase was partially offset by use of corillian s research and development personnel during to provide services for corillian s customers  which resulted in reclassification of approximately million in research and development expenses related to these personnel to cost of revenues 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues during  as compared to  was mainly due to a higher percentage of license revenues as compared to total revenues  as well as improved utilization of personnel performing professional services and an increased number of customers receiving post contractual customer support 
corillian reported net income of million for  as compared to net losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in corillian s net income in  as compared to  resulted from the increase in revenues and improved gross margins discussed above and corporate cost containment initiatives implemented throughout and corillian s overall financial position strengthened significantly during corillian generated million in net cash from operations during and had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december   as compared to million in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  working capital improved from million as of december  to million as of december  since incorporation  corillian has incurred substantial costs to develop and market its technology and to provide professional services 
as a result  corillian has accumulated a deficit of approximately million as of december  corillian s limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast future operating results 
as a result of the rapid evolution of corillian s business and limited operating history  corillian believes period to period comparisons of its results of operations  including its revenues and cost of revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  are not necessarily indicative of its future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon corillian s audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires corillian to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  corillian evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  investments  income taxes  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
corillian bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain of corillian s accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition and accruals for contracts in loss positions 
corillian s policy and related procedures for software revenue recognition are summarized below 
revenue recognition 
corillian recognizes revenues from software licensing agreements in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification  in general  of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenues on software arrangements involving multiple elements  which generally include software licenses  implementation and custom software engineering services  post contractual customer support  training services and hosting services  are allocated to the elements using the residual method specified in sop 
table of contents no 
corillian has determined that post contractual customer support and hosting services can be separated from software licenses  implementation  training and custom software engineering services because a post contractual customer support and hosting services are not essential to the functionality of any other element in the arrangement  and b sufficient vendor specific objective evidence exists to permit the allocation of revenue to these service elements 
the hosting element can be accounted for separately from the license element  as the customer can take possession of the software without significant penalty  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
vendor specific objective evidence has been established on post contractual customer support and hosting services using the price the customer is required to pay when they are sold separately the renewal rate 
under the residual method  the full fair value of post contractual customer support and hosting services are deferred and subsequently recognized as the services are performed 
the difference between the total software arrangement fee and the amount deferred for post contractual customer support and hosting services is allocated to software license  implementation  training and custom software engineering services and recognized using contract accounting 
corillian s software licenses are  in general  functionally dependent on implementation and certain custom software engineering services  therefore  software licenses and implementation services  together with custom software engineering services that are essential to the functionality of the software  are combined and recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the percentage of completion is measured by the percentage of contract hours incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract hours for each contract 
corillian has the ability to make reasonable  dependable estimates relating to the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
profit estimates are subject to revision as the contract progresses towards completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period that the facts giving rise to the revision become known 
corillian reduces the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through various approval and monitoring processes and policies 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative billings at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recorded as deferred revenue or revenue in excess of billings  respectively 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
pursuant to sop no 
 on projects where ultimate recoverability is questionable due to inherent hazards  corillian limits revenue recognition in the period to the amount of project costs incurred in the same period  and postpones recognition of profits until results can be estimated more precisely 
under this zero profit methodology  equal amounts of revenues and costs  measured on the basis of performance during the period  are presented in corillian s consolidated statements of operations 
in arrangements where corillian does not have an obligation to install its products  corillian recognizes non refundable license fees over the estimated implementation period for the customer or reseller s project 
if corillian determines that the customer or reseller can successfully install corillian s products in a production environment  corillian will recognize non refundable license fees for future arrangements in the period in which collectibility of the license fees is probable  assuming all other sop no 
revenue recognition criteria are met

both revenue and expense recognized from these projects accounted for under the zero profit methodology during and  was approximately  and  respectively 
as all three of this customer s projects were completed and accepted during  corillian recognized an additional million of revenues related to these projects  which had been previously deferred until completion of the projects  during since all cost of revenues associated with these projects had been previously recognized using the zero profit methodology  recognition of this deferred revenue resulted in the corresponding recognition of million in gross profit during no further revenues were deferred on these projects as of december  corillian s international operations contributed approximately  to corillian s consolidated revenues in  as compared with  to corillian s consolidated revenues in corillian services  inc contributed  to corillian s consolidated revenues for  as compared with approximately million to corillian s consolidated revenues for because of the restructuring actions implemented during the fourth quarter of and second quarter of and the subsequent reduction in employees throughout corillian s international operations  corillian does not expect its international operations to generate significant revenues during fiscal corillian is pursuing ways in which to increase revenues derived from its international operations through resellers 
until corillian s resellers are successful at distributing and implementing corillian s products internationally  corillian does not anticipate that revenues from international operations will comprise a significant percentage of its consolidated revenues

corillian had no material financial obligations as of december   other than obligations under its line of credit facilities and operating and capital leases  as well as its obligation to pay keybank approximately  in cash on november  future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing of research and development efforts and the expansion of corillian s operations  both domestically 
table of contents and internationally 
corillian believes its current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next months

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign exchange rate sensitivity corillian develops products in the united states and markets its products and services in the united states  and to a lesser extent in europe  asia and australia 
as a result  its financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
because nearly all of its revenue is currently denominated in united states dollars  a strengthening of the united states dollar could make corillian s products less competitive in foreign markets 
corillian does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
corillian does not engage in exchange rate hedging or hold or issue foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
corillian does have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  corillian has limited operations in europe  asia and australia and conducts transactions in various local currencies in these locales 
to date  the impact of fluctuations in the relative fair value of other currencies has not been material 
interest rate sensitivity as of december   corillian had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments consisting mainly of cash and taxable municipal bonds with original maturities from to days  as compared to million as of december  corillian s short term investments may be subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a decline in interest rates over a sustained period would reduce corillian s interest income
