item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in this report  including those set forth under item  business risk factors 
overview we design  develop  and market interactive electronic bingo systems 
we currently market portable systems that can be played anywhere within a bingo hall and a fixed base system with touchscreen activated monitors 
for our three most recent fiscal years ended october   and  our portable terminals generated approximately  and of our revenues  respectively  while  during those same years  our fixed base terminals generated the balance of our revenues 
as of october   we had systems in service in states and five foreign countries 

table of contents we generate revenue by placing electronic bingo systems in bingo halls under contracts based on a fixed fee per use per session  a fixed weekly fee per terminal  or a percentage of the revenues generated by each terminal 
revenue growth is affected by player acceptance of electronic bingo as an addition or an alternative to paper bingo  and our ability to expand operations into new markets 
fixed base bingo terminals generate greater revenue per terminal than portable bingo terminals  but also require a greater initial capital investment 
we typically install our electronic bingo systems at no charge to our customers  and we capitalize the costs 
we record depreciation of bingo equipment over a three and five year estimated useful life using the straight line method of depreciation 
our expenses consist primarily of a cost of revenue  consisting of expenses associated with technical and operational support of the bingo systems within bingo halls  depreciation of bingo systems  repair  refurbishment  and disposals of bingo terminals and related support equipment  and excess or obsolescence reserve  b general and administrative  consisting of activities associated with management of our company and related support  which includes finance and accounting  legal  compliance  information systems  human resources  accounts receivable reserve  and goodwill amortization prior to fiscal  c sales and marketing  consisting primarily of commissions paid to distributors for promoting and supporting our products and an internal sales force with a focus upon generating new customers and upgrades for existing customers  and d research and development  consisting of company sponsored research and development activities to provide players with new or enhanced products on which to play bingo 
during fiscal  a number of events occurred that affected  or may in the future affect  our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources 
in november  we acquired certain assets of igs for a cash purchase price of million which included transaction costs of  among other things  the acquisition added to our fixed base bingo terminals in operation primarily in new york and mississippi 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a business 
we determined the appropriate purchase price allocation based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition for tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to be approximately  for bingo terminals and support equipment and approximately million for identifiable intangibles with a residual amount of approximately million assigned to goodwill 
we have incurred significant expenses in aggressively defending or pursuing certain legal issues  including defense of a patent infringement lawsuit in nevada  our litigation with a former distributor in texas  and litigation with a former distributor for igs in mississippi 
the terms of the terminated distributor agreement with the former texas distributor contain certain contingent commission liabilities  which if a final judgment were rendered unfavorable to us  could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation and liquidity 
the contingent commission liabilities  only if determined at trial to be payable  would be calculated based on terms included in the terminated distributor agreement 
assuming revenues for the three year period following termination of the distributor agreement remained constant at the rate earned over the first months following termination of the distributor agreement  the contingent liability would amount to approximately million 
regarding the patent infringement matter  an unfavorable outcome at trial could result in substantial damages and payment of the plaintiff s fees and costs 
the mississippi distributor lawsuit could result in a punitive damages award which could be materially injurious to the company 
however  because we do not currently believe it probable that there will be unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters  we have not accrued any amount related to these contingent liabilities or the other potential lawsuits 
we have significantly increased the staffing of our research and development department and have increased expenditures in outside research and development costs 
we anticipate that the higher level of research and development expenditures experienced in fiscal will continue 
we expended approximately million as an investment in bingo systems and related support equipment 
this investment included an increase in the number of installed ted c  color portable terminals  and an increase in the number of flat screens as an enhancement to our fixed base systems in many markets 
we also expended an aggregate of approximately million on the buyout of two distributorship 
table of contents arrangements  enabling us to deal directly with our customers and eliminating or reducing commissions paid on revenue generated by those customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  bingo unit depreciation  goodwill impairment  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for bingo terminals placed in bingo halls under contracts based on a fixed fee per use per session  a fixed weekly fee per terminal  or a percentage of the revenue generated by each terminal 
our revenue recognition is a key component of our results of operations  and determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states when all of the following factors exist a evidence of an arrangement with the customer  b play or availability of the bingo terminals  c a fixed or determinable fee  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
we exercise judgment in assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and therefore in our determination of whether collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine these criteria are not met for future transactions  revenue recognized for future reporting periods could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the possible losses resulting from non payment of outstanding accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and distributors for credit worthiness  economic trends  changes in our customer payment terms  and historical collection experience when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also reserve a percentage of our accounts receivable based on aging category 
in determining these percentages  we review historical write offs of our receivables  payment trends  and other available information 
while such estimates have been within our expectations and the provisions established  a change in financial condition of specific customers or in overall trends experienced may result in future adjustments of our estimates of recoverability of our receivables 
reserve for bingo terminal obsolescence we provide reserves for excess or obsolete bingo terminals on hand that we do not expect to be used 
our reserves are based upon several factors  including our estimated forecast of bingo terminal demand for placement into halls 
our estimates of future bingo terminal demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete bingo terminals 
although we attempt to assure the accuracy of our estimated forecasts  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our bingo terminals and our reported operating results 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we are required to perform an annual goodwill impairment review  and depending upon the results of that measurement  the recorded goodwill may be written down and charged to income from operations when its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
in addition  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  or a loss of key personnel 
the review for fiscal was completed as of july  the valuation date  and we determined there was no impairment of goodwill as of that date 
any subsequent impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
both of these assessments require management judgment 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

we generated revenue of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase of approximately million  or  was a result of the acquisition of the assets of igs  the increase in the installed base of ted c color portable units  partially offset by decline in the installed base of black and white portable units 
the continued roll out of pay n play  our fast action  credit based pari mutuel bingo feature  also contributed to the growth in revenue 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year was compared to for fiscal key components of our cost of revenue include  among other items  depreciation of bingo equipment and service and operations expenses 
bingo equipment depreciation and amortization of related intangibles increased by approximately million over fiscal due to the acquisition of certain assets from igs  investment in ted c terminals and fixed base terminal upgrades 
service and operations expenses increased approximately million due to planned growth principally as a result of increased personnel costs 
other items in cost of revenue include charges for refurbishment  repair  and disposal of bingo terminals as well as recognition of excess or obsolete bingo terminals 
these charges in fiscal improved by million from the prior year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a million increase 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue for the current year were compared to for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in legal and consulting expenses primarily due to defense of a patent infringement lawsuit in nevada  litigation with our former distributor in texas  litigation with a former distributor of igs in mississippi and other legal proceedings 
we believe we will continue to incur a high level of legal expenses during fiscal  as trial dates for several of these matters have been set for fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing decreased approximately  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased from during fiscal to during fiscal sales and marketing includes distributor 
table of contents commissions and personnel  travel  promotional  and support costs for our internal sales force 
distributor commissions decreased  to million due to the changes in mix of revenue generated by distributors and those customers served directly by us 
additionally  fiscal included distributor termination and settlement costs 
the balance of the decrease in sales and marketing was primarily due to reductions in personnel related costs and travel expenses 
research and development 
research and development costs increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal research and development costs as a percentage of revenue increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the engineering staff and external project costs for new or enhanced products  such as our new color portable  the traveler terminal  that was introduced at an industry show in september and began beta testing in december the accelerated level of research and development spending is expected to continue in fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately and for the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates reflect certain permanent differences between financial accounting and tax accounting and the effect of state and federal income taxes on the pre tax income 
year ended october  compared with year ended october  revenue 
we generated revenue of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase of approximately  or  was primarily a result of growth in the western region and the canadian market  partially offset with a decline in the northeast region 
revenues in nevada and mississippi were adversely affected by the shutdown of our fixed base terminals in those states for approximately the last five weeks of fiscal the two day shutdown of our fixed base terminals in texas had a minor negative affect on our revenue 
installed terminals increased by over from october  to october   driven by the installation of ted c terminals 
however  revenue per unit was lower due to competitive pricing pressures and changes in the composition of terminal usage 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million during fiscal cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for the current fiscal year was compared to for fiscal cost of revenue includes  among other items  charges for refurbishment  repair and disposal of bingo equipment as well as recognition of excess or obsolete bingo terminals 
these charges in fiscal amounted to million  an improvement of million from the prior year

other items in cost of revenue include service and operations expenses and depreciation of bingo equipment 
these items amounted to million in fiscal  an increase of  over fiscal the increase was primarily due to growth of approximately  in our service and operations costs  principally as a result of increased personnel costs 
bingo equipment depreciation and other cost of revenue items increased by approximately  over fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a million decrease 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue for the current year were compared to for fiscal general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our executive management and our finance and accounting  legal  compliance  information technology  and human resources departments 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in amortization of goodwill due to our election to early adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill in fiscal  a reduction of approximately million in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable despite the reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal of approximately  related to the termination of our largest distributor in texas  primarily as a result of improved credit and collection controls in fiscal  and fiscal including an unfavorable adjustment of approximately  for settlement of disputed account balances  and an improvement of approximately million in personnel related costs due to a reduction 
table of contents of approximately million in costs related to severance and retirement of various management employees and additional cost containment efforts in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing decreased approximately million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased from during fiscal to during fiscal sales and marketing includes distributor commissions and related personnel  travel  promotional  and support costs 
distributor commissions decreased  to million due to the changes in mix of revenue generated by distributors and those customers served directly by us  offset by slightly higher termination and settlement costs in fiscal the balance of the decrease in sales and marketing was primarily due to reductions in personnel related costs and travel expenses 
research and development 
research and development costs decreased  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal research and development costs as a percentage of revenue decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the following fiscal events a retirement of a co founder and associated costs of  and b costs of approximately  associated with centralization of research and development personnel to reno  nevada 
excluding those expenses from last year  research and development costs increased approximately  over the prior year  representing increased research and development expenditures for new or enhanced products on which to play bingo 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately and for the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively 
the change in effective tax rates reflects the effect of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses on the pre tax loss in fiscal  which included amortization of goodwill without the goodwill the effective rate for fiscal was versus pre tax income in the current year 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided million of cash during fiscal compared to million during fiscal the million consisted primarily of net income of million  adjusted by million for depreciation  amortization  obsolescence provisions and loss on disposal of assets  taxes refunded of million  and a net change of million in other operating assets and liabilities 
during fiscal  the million provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income of million adjusted by million for depreciation  amortization  obsolescence provisions and loss on disposal of assets offset by a net change of million in other operating assets and liabilities 
we used approximately million of cash in investing activities during fiscal compared to million of cash during fiscal the million consisted of million of capital expenditures million of which was expended on bingo equipment  the purchase of certain assets of igs and other intangible assets for a total of million  the buyout of two distributorship agreements for an aggregate of million  offset by a decrease in short term investments of million 
during fiscal  the million consisted of million of capital expenditures million of which was for bingo equipment and an increase in short term investments of million 
financing activities provided  during fiscal compared to the use of million during fiscal the  provided during fiscal was primarily from proceeds of  from stock option exercises offset by payments of  on a note payable 
the million used during fiscal was primarily for payments of million on long term debt  offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of million 
as of october   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  we have a million line of credit with wells fargo bank  na  which has an interest rate based on the prime rate or london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus  at our option  on which there was no outstanding balance at october  the revolving credit facility expires on april  we expect to renew the 
table of contents revolving credit facility with similar terms 
we believe that cash flow from operations and cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments on hand  together with funds available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to support our operations  provide for budgeted capital expenditures  make dividend payments  and meet liquidity requirements through fiscal our long term liquidity requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which we expand our business  and whether we do so internally or through acquisitions 
in addition  strategic opportunities we may pursue could require us to fund our portion of operating expenses of such ventures and may require us to advance additional amounts should any partners in such ventures be unable to meet unanticipated capital calls or similar funding events 
to the extent that the funds generated from the sources described above are insufficient to fund our activities in the long term  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if it is available  it will be on terms acceptable to us 
contractual obligations the following table presents information on contractual obligations held as of october  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations inflation and general economic condition although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain an investment portfolio of approximately million in available for sale debt securities of the us government and its agencies  and in investment grade corporate issues 
the values of these investments are subject to changes in interest rates 
however  because these investments are short term and are generally allowed to mature  we do not believe that any risk inherent in our portfolio is likely to have a material effect on expected cash flows 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when necessary 
our revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  na is a million line of credit with an interest rate based on the prime rate or libor plus  at our option 
the line of credit expires on april  because the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is variable  our cash flow may be affected by increases in interest rates  in that we would be required to pay more interest in the event that both the prime and libor interest rates increase 
we do not believe  however  that any risk inherent in the variable rate nature of the loan is likely to have a material effect on our interest expense or available cash 
we currently maintain a zero balance on the revolving credit facility 
sensitivity analysis 
assuming we had a million balance outstanding as of october   the rate of interest calculated using the prime rate option would be 
our monthly interest payment  if the rate stayed constant  would be  if the prime rate rose to  which assumes an unusually large increase  our monthly payment would be  a more likely increase of or  given the recent trend of decreasing or relatively low interest rates  would result in a monthly payment of  or  respectively 
we do not believe the risk resulting from such fluctuations is material or that the payment required would have a material effect on cash flow
