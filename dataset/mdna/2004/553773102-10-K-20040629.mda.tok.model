item business introduction we were incorporated in delaware in march we are a holding company that operates through our subsidiaries  mts packaging systems  inc mts packaging and mts packaging systems international  ltd 
mtspi 
mts packaging primarily manufactures and sells disposable medication punch cards  packaging equipment and ancillary products throughout the united states 
its customers are predominantly pharmacies that supply nursing homes  assisted living and correctional facilities with prescription medications for their patients 
mts packaging manufactures its proprietary disposable punch cards and packaging equipment in its own facilities 
this manufacturing process uses integrated machinery for manufacturing the disposable medication punch cards 
the disposable medication punch cards and packaging equipment are designed to provide a cost effective method for pharmacies to dispense medications 
mts packaging s medication dispensing systems and products provide innovative methods for dispensing medications in disposable packages 
mtspi distributes products for mts packaging in the united kingdom 
we currently serve more than  institutional pharmacies in the long term care and correctional facility markets  both domestically and internationally 
on april   we provided our landlord with notice of intent to terminate the lease of our existing office  manufacturing and warehouse space in clearwater  florida on september  effective october   we will occupy a new leased premises at gandy blvd  st petersburg  florida 
the new facility will provide us with approximately  square feet of office and production space  which is an increase from the  square feet we currently occupy 
the terms of the new lease allow us several months to make the transition from our current location without incurring any duplicative occupancy costs 
we also have an option to lease an additional  square feet of contiguous space at any time  during the term of the new lease  provided that we give the landlord days advance notice 

table of contents in april  we announced that we would begin to do business as mts medication technologies and seek the approval of our stockholders to formally change our name to mts medication technologies  inc we also intend to merge mts packaging systems  inc into mts medication technologies  inc 
when our formal name change is approved by our stockholders 
in may  we entered into a co marketing agreement with cardinal health  inc cardinal that provides cardinal with exclusive rights to market certain of our systems directly to specified customers that serve the long term care and correctional facilities markets 
in addition  the co marketing agreement provides cardinal with the right to market the complete line of our filling and sealing equipment  and our ondemand system 
the agreement will still allow us to sell disposable products to existing and future customers through our current distribution channels

products mts packaging manufactures proprietary medication dispensing systems and related products for use by medication prescription providers primarily servicing long term care and correctional facilities 
these systems utilize disposable medication punch cards and specialized machines that automatically or semi automatically assemble  fill and seal drugs into medication punch cards representing a weekly or monthly supply of a patient s medication 
during fiscal  we introduced our newest product  the ondemand system  which we believe is the industry s first automated system capable of dispensing prescription medications into punch card compliance packaging  improving accuracy and increasing productivity 
we designed the ondemand system to interface with the pharmacy information systems to receive orders and fill a patient labeled medication compliance package on a just in time  fully automated basis 
the current system has the capacity to hold up to different medications and dispense them into patient specific labeled punch cards at a rate of up to eight cards per minute  utilizing only two employees 
we believe this technology promotes a new industry standard for packaging and distributing medications through institutional pharmacies to a wide range of end users including skilled nursing  assisted living and correctional facilities 
our customers use mts packaging s machinery for dispensing medication in disposable packages by automatically placing tablets or capsules the amount of medication required by a patient during one month into a punch card 
the use of these cards and machines provides a cost effective customized package at competitive prices 
the punch card medication dispensing system can provide tamper evident packaging for products dispensed in the package 
the retail price of mts packaging s machinery ranges from  to  depending upon the degree of automation and options requested by a customer 
the punch cards typically retail from approximately to per  cards and blisters  depending upon the size  design and volume of cards ordered by a customer 
mts packaging has placed approximately  medication dispensing systems with pharmacy clientele since our inception 
mts packaging also sells prescription labels and ancillary supplies designed to complement sales of disposable medication punch cards 
mts packaging had approximately  in unshipped orders as of june  compared to approximately  as of june  research and development we expended approximately   and  on research and development activities for each of the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
in addition  we directed our product development efforts primarily towards the completion of several versions of our ondemand machine during this fiscal year 
we capitalized approximately  of product development during the fiscal year ended march  the majority of these expenditures were made for the ondemand machine project 

table of contents manufacturing processes mts packaging has developed integrated punch card manufacturing equipment that will complete the various punch card manufacturing steps in a single line  automated process 
we believes that our advanced automation gives us certain speed  cost and flexibility advantages over conventional punch card manufacturers 
mts packaging s equipment produces finished cards on a single in line flexographic press 
this process takes the place of approximately five different processes using conventional offset printing methods 
mts packaging has several machines capable of producing punch cards in this manner 
in addition to the manufacturing of punch cards  mts packaging manufactures the machines that are sold to its customers to fill punch cards with medication 
the majority of these machines are sold to customers  however  from time to time  customers are provided or rented machines in conjunction with an agreement to purchase certain quantities of punch cards over a specified period 
mts packaging uses automated fabrication equipment to produce its medication packaging machinery 
all essential components of the machines are designed and manufactured by us without reliance on outside vendors 
mts packaging is dependent on a number of suppliers for the raw materials essential in the production of its products 
we believe that relations are adequate with our existing vendors 
however  there can be no assurance that such relations will be adequate in the future or that shortages of any of these raw materials will not arise  causing production delays 
mts packaging believes it is necessary to maintain an inventory of materials and finished products that allows for customer orders to be shipped within the industry standard of two to three days 
the inability to obtain raw materials on a timely basis and on acceptable terms may have a material adverse effect on our future financial performance 
markets and customers mts packaging s products are sold primarily throughout the united states through its sales organization and independent sales representatives 
in addition  mts packaging systems international distributes product in the united kingdom 
mts packaging also participates in trade shows and training seminars 
sales to countries outside the united states represent less than of the total revenue in fiscal sales to our two largest customers represented approximately and  respectively  of mts packaging s revenue in the fiscal year ended march  the primary customers for mts packaging s proprietary packaging machinery and the related disposable punch cards  labels and ancillary supplies are pharmacies that supply prescription medication to nursing homes 
these pharmacies serve from to  nursing home beds per location and many serve the sub acute care  assisted living  correctional and home health care markets as well 
competition the pharmacy customers of mts packaging supply prescribed medications to nursing homes and assisted living facilities  which are the primary market for mts packaging s products 
this market is highly competitive 
there are several competitors that have developed machines that automate the packaging and sealing of solid medications into punch cards 
we believe that products developed by our competitors are not as efficient as our systems because they are not as automated 
our method of dispensing medication replaces more traditional dispensing methods  such as prescription vials 
the principal methods of competition in supplying medication dispensing systems to prescription service providers are product innovation  price  customization and product performance 
many of our competitors have been in business longer and have substantially greater resources than us 
there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with competitive methods of dispensing medication or other punch card systems 
our primary competitors for punch card dispensing systems in the united states are drug package  inc  automed technologies and rx systems  inc we believe that our automated proprietary packaging machinery distinguishes mts packaging from its competitors less automated systems 
our automated packaging machine with the highest throughput can fill and seal up to disposable medication cards per hour 
we believe that our production rates for the prepackaging of prescriptions and our just in time ondemand system will meet the needs of our customers who are consolidating and require higher productivity to meet their growing market share 

table of contents proprietary technology in june  we purchased the rights to certain proprietary technology that had previously been available through a license agreement with the siegel family trust 
the proprietary technology is supported by certain patents  which expire at various times during calendar years through there are numerous patent applications and patent license agreements for products that have been sold and that have been in development within mts packaging 
however  its business is not materially dependent upon the issuing or its ownership of any one patent that has been submitted to the united states patent and trademark office 
there is no assurance that any additional patents will be granted with respect to our medication dispensing or information systems and products or that any patent issued  now or in the future  will provide meaningful protection from competition 
government regulations mts packaging s products are governed by federal regulations concerning components of packaging materials that are in contact with food and drugs 
we have obtained assurances from our vendors that the packaging materials used by mts packaging are in conformity with such regulations 
however  there is no assurance that significant changes in the regulations applicable to our products will not occur in the foreseeable future 
any such changes could have a material adverse effect on us 
we cannot predict the extent to which our operations will be effected under the laws and regulations described above or any new regulations that may be adopted by regulatory agencies 
employees as of june   we employed persons full time 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
risk factors you should be aware that the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones affecting us or that could affect us in the future 
any of the risks and uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial conditions  and could result in a partial or complete loss of your investment 
we have many competitors and expect new competitors to enter our market  which could adversely affect our ability to increase revenue  maintain our margins or grow our market share 
the market for our services is extremely competitive and the barriers to entry in our market are relatively low 
we cannot be sure that we will have the resources or expertise to compete successfully in the future 
our competitors may be able to develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly  adapt to new or emerging technologies and changing customer needs more quickly  negotiate more favorable purchases agreements with suppliers  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products  and address customers service related issues more effectively 
some of our competitors may also be able to provide customers with additional benefits at lower overall costs or to reduce their charges aggressively in an effort to increase market share 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to match cost reductions by our competitors 

table of contents our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors  including adverse changes in general economic conditions  the level and timing of customer orders  the composition of the costs of revenue between materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product  fluctuations in materials costs and availability of materials  and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales and customer product delivery requirements 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to variation in demand for our products  new product introductions and consolidations among our customers 
in the past  changes in customer orders have had a significant effect on our results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of overhead absorption 
any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly results of operations in the future 
we depend on a limited number of customers for our sales revenue  therefore  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue 
for the fiscal year ended march   our largest customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue and our two largest customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue 
we are dependent upon the continued growth  viability and financial stability of our customers whose industries have experienced consolidation  pricing and regulatory pressures 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we depend on a small number of suppliers for the raw materials used in the production of our products 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for the raw materials that are essential in the production of the products we produce 
we cannot assure you that such suppliers will be able to meet our future demand for raw materials  or that shortages of these raw materials will not arise in the future 
the failure of such suppliers to deliver such raw materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development 
the continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to hire  retain and expand our qualified engineering and technical personnel  maintain technological leadership  develop and market products that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 

table of contents although we believe that our operations use the assembly and testing technologies  equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers  we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future 
the emergence of new technology industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment  inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive 
the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment  which could reduce our operating margins and our operating results 
our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements could have an adverse effect on our business 
we manufacture substantially all of our products from a single facility 
we manufacture substantially of the products we sell 
as a result  any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility  whether due to technical or labor difficulties  destruction of or damage to any facility or other reasons  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in this regard  our principal manufacturing facility is located in clearwater  florida and is thus exposed to the risks of damage from certain weather conditions including  without limitation hurricanes  windstorms  and floods 
if our facilities were to be out of production for an extended period  our business  financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected 
we rely on short term contracts with most of our clients 
long term contracts are not a significant part of our business 
accordingly  future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 
we are dependent on the proper functioning of our information systems in operating our business 
our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards and we have backup remote processing capabilities 
they are still vulnerable  however  to hurricanes  other storms  flood  fire  terrorist acts  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  physical or software break ins  computer viruses and similar events 
if our critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable  we would have to accomplish these functions manually  which could temporarily impact our ability to identify business opportunities quickly  to maintain billing and clinical records reliably  and to bill for services efficiently 
in addition  we depend on third party vendors for certain functions whose future performance and reliability we can not warranty 
our success depends upon retaining the services of our management team 
we are highly dependent on our management team 
we expect that our continued success will largely depend upon the efforts and abilities of members of our management team 
the loss of the services of any of our key executives for any reason could have a material adverse effect upon us 
our success also depends upon our ability to identify  develop  and retain qualified management  professionals and technical operating staff 
we expend significant resources in recruiting and training our employees  and the pool of available applicants for these positions is limited 
the loss of the services of any key executives  or our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified staff  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
adverse results in tax audits could result in significant cash expenditures or exposure to unforeseen liabilities 
we are subject to periodic federal  state and local income tax audits for various tax years 
although we attempt to comply with all taxing authority regulations  adverse findings or assessments made by the taxing authorities as the result of an audit could materially adversely affect us 
we are a holding company and we depend on receiving distributions from our subsidiaries  and we could be harmed if such distributions could not be made in the future 
we are a holding company with essentially no operations of our own and conduct all of our business through our subsidiaries 
our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries 
we are wholly dependent on the cash flow of our subsidiaries and dividends and distributions to us from our subsidiaries in order to service any current and future indebtedness obligations we may have 

table of contents we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
we have not paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
the terms of our loan agreements prohibit us from paying dividends on our common stock 
the issuance of additional shares of our common stock as a result of the conversion or exercise of currently outstanding derivative securities may cause our stock price to decline 
as of june   we had  shares of common stock outstanding as of march  in addition  the following shares of our common stock are issuable upon exercise or conversion of currently outstanding securities  shares of common stock are issuable upon exercise of currently outstanding common stock purchase options having exercise prices ranging from to   shares of common stock are issuable upon exercise of currently outstanding common stock purchase warrants having exercise prices ranging from to  and  shares of common stock are issuable upon conversion of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock the series a preferred stock 
the possibility of exercise or conversion of these securities and the inclusion of the underlying shares of common stock in the issued and outstanding shares may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
if we must make certain payments of certain amounts to eureka i  lp  such payments could have a material effect on our financial condition and could cause our stock price to decline 
the terms of our series a preferred stock issued to eureka i  lp  contain certain anti dilution provisions and a make whole provision that obligates us to pay certain amounts to the holder of the series a preferred stock if such holder does not ultimately receive an amount equal to the price per share of the common stock on the date they exercise their right to purchase the common shares that underlie the series a preferred stock 
in the event that we are required to make payments to the holders of the series a preferred stock  we may elect to issue additional preferred stock in lieu of a cash payment 
the make whole provision and other provisions of the convertible preferred stock agreement provide for a maximum of  shares that may be issued pursuant to those provisions 
we may be adversely affected by governmental regulation of our business 
our business is subject to federal regulation concerning components of packaging materials that are in contact with food and drugs 
while we have had no material difficulty complying with such regulations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain all necessary approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material 
additionally  we cannot assure you that significant changes in such regulations will not occur in the foreseeable future 
our inability to comply with the current regulations and any future changes to such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of the products we manufacture and sell results in personal injury 
we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of the products we manufacture and sell results in personal injury 
although we have not experienced any losses due to product liability claims  we cannot assure you that we will not experience such losses in the future 
we maintain insurance against product liability claims  but we cannot be certain that such coverage will be adequate to cover any liabilities that we may incur  or that such insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage  or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us  could harm our business 

table of contents if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business and prospects may be harmed 
our ability to compete effectively is dependent upon the proprietary nature of the designs  processes  technologies and materials owned by  used by or licensed to us 
although we attempt to protect our proprietary property  technologies and processes both in the united states and in foreign countries through a combination of patent law  trade secrets and non disclosure agreements  these may be insufficient 
in addition  because of the differences in foreign patent and other laws concerning proprietary rights  our products may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the united states 
intellectual property claims and litigation could subject us to significant liabilities for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
in the future we may have to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to develop the validity and scope of our proprietary rights of others 
any litigation  regardless of its success  would be costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel 
the litigation could also force us to stop or delay selling  incorporating or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  pay damages  enter into licensing or royalty agreements  which may be unavailable under acceptable terms  and redesign products and services that incorporate infringing technology 
we may face infringement claims from third parties in the future 
the medical packaging industry has seen frequent litigation over intellectual property rights  and we expect that participants in the medical packaging industry will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products  services  and competitors grow and functionality of the products and services overlap 
we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary rights or that third parties will not independently develop substantially similar products  services and technology 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our products will not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we may not be able to avoid infringement of third party intellectual property rights and may have to obtain a license  defend an infringement action  or challenge the validity of the intellectual property rights in court 
failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights in our products  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on us 
our business will suffer if we fail to comply with recent federal regulations and proposed rules of the sec relating to corporate governance reform 
as a public company  we are subject to certain federal regulations and the rules and regulations of the sec 
on july   president george w 
bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of  effecting tighter accounting  corporate fraud and securities laws 
to implement this legislation  the sec is expected to adopt new rules pertaining to  among other things  audit committee requirements and additional disclosure and reporting requirements 
our reputation and financial results could be materially harmed by any failure by us to comply with any current or future rules or regulations relating to the sarbanes oxley act or to any other federal corporate reform measures 
our stock price may be volatile 
our common stock is traded on the american stock exchange under the symbol mpp 
the market price of our stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future  based on a variety of factors  including our operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets  or other developments affecting us  our clients  or our competitors  some of which may be unrelated to our performance 
those fluctuations and demand for our services may adversely affect the price of our stock 
it is possible that the stock price may decline to a level where we lose our eligibility to remain listed on the american stock exchange 

table of contents in addition  the stock market  in general  has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of public companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 
among other things  volatility in our stock price could mean that investors will not be able to sell their shares at or above prices at which they are acquired 
the volatility also could impair our ability in the future to offer common stock as a source of additional capital 
our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights 
the holders of our capital stock do not have cumulative voting rights 
accordingly  the holders of more than of our outstanding shares entitled to vote for the election of directors can elect all of our directors then being elected  the holders of the remaining shares by themselves cannot elect any directors 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the applicable delaware general corporation law may make it more difficult to complete a contested takeover of our company 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the delaware general corporation law the dgcl could deter a change in our management or render more difficult an attempt to obtain control of us  even if such a proposal is favored by a majority of our stockholders 
for example  we are subject to the provisions of the dgcl that prohibit a public delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns or more of the corporation s outstanding voting shares an interested shareholder for three years after the person became an interested shareholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
finally  our certificate of incorporation includes undesignated preferred stock  which may enable our board of directors to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a tender offer  proxy contest  merger or otherwise 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect any market on which our shares trade  the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist acts or acts of war or armed conflict could negatively affect our operations in a number of ways 
primarily  any of these acts could result in increased volatility in or damage to the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they could also result in a continuation of the current economic uncertainty in the united states and abroad 
acts of terrorism or armed conflict  and the uncertainty caused by such conflicts  could cause an overall reduction in sales of our products and the corresponding shipments of our products 
this would have a corresponding negative effect on our operations 
also  terrorist activities similar to the type experienced on september  could result in another halt of trading of securities on the american stock exchange  which could also have an adverse affect on the trading price of our shares and overall market capitalization

independent pharmacies are those that are not affiliated with pharmacies that are national in scope  but rather rely on the relationships they have with nursing homes and assisted living facilities in a small geographic region 
in addition  we sold six ondemand machines in fiscal compared to three machines in fiscal 
table of contents as the population ages  the number of nursing home and assisted living facility residents grows  which benefits our entire customer base 
in addition  our revenue growth has been enhanced by increased sales of the machines we manufacture and sell to our customers  including our new ondemand machine 
although competitive pricing issues related to the disposable punch card products arise from time to time  we rely heavily on the relationships we build with customers  which are centered around our complete medication packaging system that includes the machines  as well as the disposables  in order to offset competitive pricing pressures 
although the cost of raw materials and the direct labor used to manufacture the disposable punch cards has risen during fiscal year ended march   compared with the previous fiscal year  we have been successful in maintaining the relationship between our selling prices and direct costs by adjusting prices where appropriate and developing efficiencies by adding new manufacturing equipment that better produces cards and blisters 
overhead costs incurred in manufacturing have risen approximately in the fiscal year ended march  to approximately million from approximately million in the same period the prior fiscal year primarily due to costs added to properly supervise and warranty the ondemand product line 
the company expects this trend will continue for the fiscal year ending in as the ondemand product line generates more customer interest and subsequent revenue 
selling costs for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year increased approximately to million from million the prior year because the company has added to its sales and customer service support staff

administrative costs have risen approximately in the fiscal year ended march   compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year from approximately million to approximately million 
the increase was primarily due to costs that have been added to support the operations in the united kingdom and personnel related expenses including employee benefit costs in the united states 
currently we do not expect that our administrative costs will rise at the same percentage rate in fiscal as they did in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year results of operation net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march   increased to million from million the prior year 
net sales increased in fiscal primarily as a result of an increase in disposable punch cards sold to existing and new customers in the united states  an increase in disposable punch cards and machines sold in the united kingdom and the sale of ondemand machines in the united states selling prices for disposable punch cards were stable during fiscal we expect that selling prices for disposable punch cards may decrease in the next fiscal year depending on competitive factors

we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined above 
contractual obligations summarized below are our obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations as of march  less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt   capital leases operating leases purchaser obligations other long term liabilities estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses for the respective period ended for such statements 
the determination of estimates requires the use of judgment since future events and their affect on our operations cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
actual results typically differ from these estimates in some fashion  and at times  these variances may be material to our financial statements 
our management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under these circumstances 
these estimates and our actual results are subject to the risk factors listed above under item business 
nevertheless  our management believes the following items involve a higher degree of complexity and  judgment and therefore  has commented on these items below 

table of contents valuation of accounts receivable at march  and  respectively our allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  at march  and  respectively  is based on management s estimates of the credit worthiness of our customers  current economic conditions and historical information 
in the opinion of management  our allowance for doubtful accounts is believed to be an amount sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
historically  the levels of recorded bad debt expense and write offs have not been material to our financial statements 
should business conditions deteriorate or any large customer default on its obligations to us  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact upon our operations 
inventory obsolescence valuation allowance our allowance for inventory obsolescence and slow moving inventory is reviewed on a regular basis 
we review various information related to the age and turnover of specific inventory items to assist in our assessment 
in the opinion of management  the valuation allowance is believed to be sufficient to absorb the ultimate obsolescence of certain inventory as they may occur 
the inventory obsolescence valuation allowance was  and  at march  and  respectively 
self insurance plan reserve we established a reserve for unpaid medical claims of  and  at march  and  respectively 
management reviews claims history information provided to it by the third party administrator of the self insured plan on a regular basis and believes that the reserve is sufficient to respond to the claims that may be incurred by the participants in the plan 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance our deferred tax asset is comprised primarily of a tax loss carryforward 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefits associated with the tax loss carryforward will be realized in the future 
management bases its belief  in part  on the historical profitability of our operations and its expectations that profitable operations will continue in the future 
based upon these expectations regarding the realization of the tax benefits  management has not established a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset 
impairment valuations on a quarterly basis  management assesses the composition of our assets and liabilities  as well as the events that have occurred and the circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination 
if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related asset or liability below its carrying amount  the related asset or liability would be tested for impairment 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors considered include current operating results  trends and anticipated undiscounted future cash flows 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the sum of discounted using our incremental borrowing rate estimated future cash flows over a period ranging from generally four to ten years expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value 
management believes no impairment existed for any of the periods presented 
product development all costs incurred subsequent to the completion of research and development activities associated with a product s hardware components and the software components achievement of technological feasibility are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
product development costs are generally amortized over a five year period beginning on the date the product is released for sale to customers 
on a quarterly basis  we review the viability and recoverability of these project costs 

table of contents estimated liabilities we make a number of estimates in the ordinary course of business 
historically  past changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on our financial condition 
however  circumstances could change  which would alter future financial information based upon a change in estimated versus actual results 
we are subject to various matters of litigation in the ordinary course of business 
as the outcome of any litigation is unknown  management estimates the potential amount of liability  if any  in excess of any applicable insurance coverage  based on historical experience and or the best estimate of the matter at hand 
significant changes in estimated amounts could occur 
to date  we have not had to pay any legal settlements in excess of existing insurance coverage 
warranty we establish a reserve for warranty costs we may incur during the warranty period that is provided for in the ondemand machine sales agreements with our customers 
warranty expense incurred during the period ended march   totaled  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not have any material market risk sensitive financial instruments
