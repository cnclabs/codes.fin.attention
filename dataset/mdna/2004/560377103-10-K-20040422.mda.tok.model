item properties as of december   mps had approximately circuit miles of transmission lines and mps owned approximately  miles of distribution lines  all in aroostook county and a portion of penobscot county in northern maine 
there are no material physical assets held  owned or controlled by any of the company s other subsidiaries 
substantially all of the properties owned by mps are subject to the liens of the first and second mortgage indentures and deeds of trust 
in response to a maine environmental regulation to phase out poly chlorinated bi phenol pcb transformers  mps has implemented a program to eliminate transformers on its system that do not meet the new state environmental guidelines 
the program will test the almost  distribution transformers over a ten year period 
in addition  transformers that pass the inspection criteria will be refurbished and refitted with lightning arrestors and animal guards 
the initial cost of the ten year program was estimated to be million 
after three years  mps has spent approximately  under the program 
mps is currently in its fourth year of this ten year program 
system security and reliability during  the engineering consulting firm of rw beck  inc rw beck  was retained to undertake a comprehensive facilities evaluation and engineering audit of the mps transmission and distribution systems 
the purpose of the evaluation and audit were to provide a comprehensive condition baseline of the transmission and distribution systems as a beginning basis for development of new transmission and distribution system plans and the implementation of asset management initiatives 
as a result of the condition baseline and increasing focus on system planning  mps has implemented a continuous in the field inspection program for transmission and distribution 
the inspection program has been facilitated by the investment in new mobile equipment allowing for top down inspections versus traditional pole climbing or bottom up processes 
further  mps has begun development of twenty year distribution and transmission planning processes 
these planning processes are intended to focus on means to improve overall system reliability  while minimizing lifecycle asset management costs and reducing future required capital expenditures 
from a transmission perspective  the rw beck audit noted that transmission lines appeared to be in good condition and reasonably maintained 
however  they did note on a relative basis that certain lines were older  but in good condition with the exception of some of the oldest wood pole lines and areas where bird woodpecker damage is a problem 
through mps s in the field transmission inspection program  structures in need of repair or replacement are page of being identified and repaired or replaced 
current plans are to undertake complete inspections of mps s transmission system every two years 
audits of the company s substations and substation related business processes were also undertaken by rw beck 
the overall ratings for substations were lower than desired  due to the fact that almost half of the distribution substations rely on power transformers that have exceeded their useful lives or are within five years of exceeding their useful lives 
while certain transformers are beyond their normal life expectancy  mps has implemented a comprehensive testing program to identify problem transformers  implementing preventive maintenance to extend equipment life expectancies  or replacing such transformers 
as part of the system planning process  mps is developing a plan to replace older transformers  which will focus on consolidating substations where possible  all a part of mps s long term system planning process 
mps had planned to reduce its annual capital expenditures to a level approximately equal to its rate of depreciation 
due to mps s desire to consolidate facilities and ensure increased system reliability  management believes that renewal and replacement capital expenditures for the next two to three years may remain at more recent historical levels of million to million annually 
such expenditure levels do not include the possible construction of additional transmission as later described 
as a result of the closure of an on system generation facility and uncertainty concerning other merchant and non merchant generation facilities within the maritimes and northern maine regions  mps continues to evaluate system security  particularly from an on peak generation resource perspective 
through load flow analysis and utilization of specific contingency or transmission outage scenarios  it has been determined that under a single contingency or outage condition and during peak load situations  a system wide outage is possible if at least mw s of on system generation are not operating 
additionally  under certain conditions  the analyses noted that a second contingency or transmission line outage could not be survived within a thirty minute time frame when similar conditions existed after a single contingency 
although maine public service company does not have a bulk delivery transmission system as defined by the northeastern power coordinating council npcc  mps is using npcc s standards for planning criteria 
it should be noted that potential contingencies that were studied focused on situations that could impact mps s transmission and distribution systems  even though certain transmission assets are located in canada and are owned by other companies or organizations 
mps has contingency plans to mitigate such conditions or events in the case that a major transmission outage or system outage occurred 
as a result of internal and external transmission system security studies in the fall of  a unique risk to the mps system was identified due to a condition on an nb power breaker at the beechwood kv substation in canada 
the risk was that for a single breaker malfunction at beechwood substation  mps could lose two of its three main interconnections with nb power 
the loss of these interconnections  coupled with the uncertainty of on system merchant generation levels  required mps to act to prevent conditions that could result in an outage 
consequently  mps paid nb power  in december of  for installing a series breaker  which eliminated this risk to the mps transmission system 
in order to address system security and reliability needs  mps is also evaluating the construction of additional interconnections with nb power 
such projects  subject to further analysis and regulatory approvals  would increase available and total transmission capacities 
in addition  mps is evaluating the merits of joining a new independent system operator iso or regional transmission organization rto 
at this time it is unclear as to the potential outcome of these efforts 
further  due to shortages of peaking generation capacity within the maritimes region  mps is evaluating other non transmission options to ensure system reliability 
such alternative options may require legislative or regulatory approvals 
page of item legal proceedings item i maine and maritimes corporation a maine public utilities commission  request for approval of reorganization of mps into a holding company structure  docket no 
on october   mps filed a request for mpuc approval of the formation of a maine based holding company structure 
under this structure  mps  ea  as well as other affiliates or subsidiaries  the creation of which was anticipated to occur at a later date  would become subsidiaries of a holding company  holdco 
in its application  mps stated that the corporate restructuring would be accomplished through a reverse triangular merger  similar to the one employed in cmp s application for approval of reorganization  of transactions with affiliated interests  and transfer of assets  mpuc docket no 
the proposed mps restructuring constituted a reorganization requiring mpuc approval pursuant to the provisions of a mrsa in addition to the proposed reorganization  mps also requested the approval of certain stock issuances and affiliated interest transactions 
specifically  mps requested mpuc approval of the following transactions and arrangements the creation of a corporation holdco that became the parent company of mps through its ownership of all outstanding company stock of mps  the creation of a corporation mergeco whose only purpose was to facilitate the corporate reorganization and which  when organized  became a wholly owned subsidiary of holdco and which ceased to exist  once it had served its purpose  the conversion and exchange of all the outstanding shares of mps s common stock into an equal number of shares of holdco s common stock to the degree that the conversion and exchange of mps stock to be effected in that transaction was deemed to constitute an issuance of utility stock within the meaning of a mrsa and  the merger of mergeco into mps  with mps as the surviving corporation  and the resulting conversion of the outstanding shares of mergeco common stock into a number of shares of the common stock of mps equal to the number of shares of mps s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the share conversion described in item above  which was deemed issued by mps for this purpose  the dividend by maine public service of its limited liability company interests in energy atlantic to holdco pursuant to a mrsa  and  the execution and delivery of the managerial and support services agreement and approval of the cost manual submitted in conjunction therewith pursuant to a mrsa  the winding up and dissolving of me nb at such future time as mps might deem appropriate pursuant to a mrsa  and  the transfer  after the merger date  i of assets that were not necessary or useful within the meaning of section of title a  from mps to any mps affiliate  and ii the transfer of all other assets from mps to holdco or any non mps holdco subsidiary in the total amount of up to  over the three year period beginning upon the merger date 
mps also requested that the commission authorize the creation of holdco and mergeco within thirty days of the date of its filing 
this interim approval was for the limited purpose of making necessary filings with the securities and exchange commission under the public utility holding company act and for executing a registration statement under federal securities law 
as part of this request for interim approval  mps also represented that should the commission have denied its petition for reorganization  or if for any other reason their organization did not occur  it would dissolve both holdco and mergeco 
page of subsequent to its filing  mps received and responded to several requests for information from the mpuc and the office of public advocate  an intervenor in the proceeding  and met on several occasions with interested parties 
the parties settled all issues in the proceeding  and entered a signed stipulation formally approved by the mpuc on march  the text of the mpuc order  docket no 
may be viewed as exhibit ao of this form k such information is incorporated in this section by this reference 
mps also filed  on march   a form s registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for maine maritimes corporation the entity designated as holdco in this disclosure 
the reorganization became effective june  at mps s annual meeting of shareholders  held on may   shareholders of mps voted to approve its plan to create a holding company structure  under mam

item ii mps rate cases a maine public utilities commission  request for approval of alternative rate plan  mpuc docket as reported in prior mps and mam quarterly reports on form q which are incorporated in this section by this reference  on march   mps submitted its formal request for approval of alternate rate plan the arp mpuc docket 
the proposal was a seven year rate plan for its distribution delivery services with a target implementation date on or before july  the arp was an alternative form of regulating mps s distribution assets  similar to the performance rate plans the mpuc has adopted for cmp and bangor hydro electric company 
in accordance with a state statute enacted during the course of mps s arp proceedings  maine utilities requesting an arp are required to file cost of service financial information as part of the proceeding 
in connection with this aspect of the arp review and analysis  mps had been authorized by  and had received final approval from the mpuc to increase its electric delivery rates 
also in connection with this process mps announced that effective october   mps would increase the distribution component of its electric delivery rate by for a total increase in its electric delivery rate of  for a total revenue increase of  however  during the compliance filing phase of this proceeding  an issue arose concerning the calculation of rate sheets and the corresponding retail distribution and transmission revenues 
following the entry of a procedural order  discovery  and a public conference a supplemental stipulation in this case was entered into and filed with the maine public utilities commission mpuc on october   correcting the allocation of revenues between distribution and transmission  and resulting in mps increased its total electric delivery rate by  or a total revenue increase not to exceed  as a result  effective november   mps distribution rates were increased 
this increase included  in distribution revenues and  in transmission revenues 
a copy of the stipulation and the order approving the increase may be viewed on the mpuc website at http www

following the entry of the order approving the supplemental stipulation  the arp proceeding was bifurcated and on december   mps notified the mpuc of its intention to withdraw the remaining elements of the arp docket 
for the purposes of future rate proceedings mps will continue to evaluate if an arp is in the best interest of mps  its shareholders and consumers or if it should continue to proceed with cost of service rate filings as it has done in the past 
page of as a part of this rate case  the mpuc approved mps s request to fix its debt interest rates through the purchase of interest rate swap derivatives 
prior to mps s fixing of its interest rates through such interest rate swaps  all of its debt had been subject to variable interest rates 
given the long term nature of mps s debt  management believed that locking the rates at historically low levels reduced future shareholder and consumer risks associated with the volatility of interest rates 
effective interest rates achieved by the swaps for mps s variable rate debt through maturity range from to 
see item a of this form k  note of the consolidated financial statements  long term debt for a description of these debt issues and associated swap rates 
b maine public utilities commission investigation into mps s stranded cost revenue requirements and rates in mpuc docket no 
as previously reported in the prior mps k filing of march   mps received final approval from the mpuc for the stranded cost revenue component of its electric delivery rates 
under title a of the maine revised statutes annotated  section  the mpuc is required to periodically investigate and adjust the stranded cost charges reflected in the rates of a transmission and distribution utility 
in accordance with this provision  on september   in docket no 
 the mpuc issued a notice of investigation in order to determine whether mps s rates must be changed effective march  to reflect any changes in mps s stranded costs 
on february   the mpuc issued an order approving a stipulation under which mps is allowed to recover  per year to satisfy its approved stranded cost revenue requirements for the rate effective period  which began march   and will end on december  the approved revenue requirement for the rate effective period ended february  was  under the approved stipulation mps s stranded cost rates approved in docket no 
will remain in effect during the rate effective period 
the stipulation approved by the mpuc in docket no 
also approved and reaffirmed each of the elements and associated balances of mps s recoverable stranded costs 
as explained more fully below  during the course of docket no 
the parties reviewed the manner in which mps was recovering and accounting for its carrying charges associated with the deferred fuel element of its stranded cost 
as a result of the stipulation approved in docket no 
 mps will record deferred income tax expense associated with deferred fuel carrying charges during the rate effective period from march  through december   as compared to past treatment where such expense was deferred for future recovery 
because the deferred fuel carrying charge component of mps s stranded costs is not expected to be fully amortized until  mps anticipates that deferred income tax expense will be incurred through  subject to future stranded cost filings with the mpuc 
in dockets nos 
and  the parties stipulated that mps would accrue carrying costs on its unrecovered fuel balance the deferred fuel account during the respective rate effective period at its net of tax cost of capital rate 
consistent with the stipulation in docket no 
 mps accrued a carrying charge using the net of tax rate of through october  applied against its unrecovered deferred fuel balance 
from november  to december  mps accrued its carrying charge using a net of tax rate of  based on the cost of capital approved in docket no 
described in docket no 
partial stipulation filed on september  
during the course of the docket no 
proceeding  mps determined that it had not previously recognized accumulated deferred income taxes with respect to the carrying charges on the deferred fuel account and that the recording of a deferred tax liability on its balance sheet pursuant to fas in the amount of million was required 
the deferred fuel balance as of march  prior to any adjustment was  under the stipulation mps is allowed to adjust its accumulated deferred income tax account and the deferred fuel balance by  as of march   resulting in a total deferred balance as of march  of  under the approved stipulation the parties also agreed that the return component on the deferred fuel balance should be reduced in such a manner that ratepayers were held harmless on a net present value basis as a result of the march  adjustment to the deferred fuel balance 
during the rate effective period ending on december   the overall pre tax return component on the deferred fuel balance will be  reflecting a return on equity 
the return on the deferred fuel balance will be reviewed in future stranded cost rate setting proceedings and will be adjusted as necessary in order that the present value of the revenue requirements of the deferred fuel account without the adjustments described above equals the present value of the revenue requirements of the deferred fuel account with the adjustments 
mps concludes that as a result of this stipulation and the foregoing described adjustment to the deferred fuel balance and the accumulated deferred income tax liability that no further adjustment is necessary under fas in order to reflect prior unrecorded deferred income taxes 
page of the decreased cost of capital rate beginning on march  will have an impact on future stranded cost earnings and stranded cost freed up cash flows  but will not impact future distribution or transmission earnings 
in the year  mps anticipates that it will record deferred income tax expense of approximately  associated with the deferred fuel carrying charges 
the amount of deferred income tax expense recorded in future years will vary depending upon the amount of the accrued carrying charge in any year  and the tax rates then in effect 
mps anticipates that earnings from carrying charges on its stranded costs in will be approximately  lower than the amount that would have been recorded had mps continued to use the original cost of capital on its deferred fuel balance  for a total earnings impact of  in the impact on future earnings resulting from the agreed upon lower cost of capital  when compared against the cost of capital used in prior stranded cost filings  will vary 
schedules filed by mps as part of the stipulation in docket no 
reflect the deferred fuel balance as of march   certain additions relating to the wheelabrator sherman above market contract through december  and the amortization of the deferred fuel balance though applying these assumptions  current tax rates and the agreed upon cost of capital  mps anticipates that the impact on future earnings resulting from recording deferred income taxes on accrued carrying charges and applying a lower cost of capital to the deferred fuel balance could range from million in  increasing to million in  then gradually decreasing to  in these amounts may vary with changes in the deferred fuel balance and other variables which mps cannot predict with certainty at this time 
management is analyzing means to mitigate the impact of this stipulation on future net income and stranded cost freed up cash flows 
in addition to the return allowed on its deferred fuel account as set forth above  under the approved stipulation mps shall be allowed to recover the following pre tax returns on the applicable stranded cost rate base components during the rate effective period i the pre tax return on unrecovered balance of the wheelabrator sherman nug contract buydown shall be plus its fame issuance costs  ii the pre tax return on the unrecovered seabrook investment and approved special rate contract costs shall be  and  iii the pre tax return on the maine yankee decommissioning related costs shall be

overview mam  a maine corporation  became a holding company effective june   and owns all of the common stock of mps 
all of the shares of mps common stock were converted on the books into an equal number of shares of mam common stock  which are listed on the amex under the trading symbol mam 
prior to electric retail deregulation within the state of maine and its divestiture of generation  mps served as a regulated and vertically integrated electric utility 
as a result of deregulation and generation divestiture  mps s revenue model and rate base underwent significant change 
today  mps s returns are based on specifically allowable rates of return  as permitted by the mpuc and the ferc on various physical and regulatory assets  referred to as mps s rate base 
while rates of return may remain more stable  should the overall rate base decline  then earnings will also decline 
mps s current rate base consists primarily of transmission and distribution networks poles  wires  substations buildings and rolling stock  as well as regulatory assets that include stranded costs associated with the sale of generation  closure of generation and or purchase power agreements 
mps s primary regulatory asset or stranded cost is associated with the wheelabrator sherman nug contract  more fully described within this k see item above  business  discussion and description of the company s growth strategy  and description of maine public service company mps and maine and new brunswick electrical power company  limited me nb 
in the case of the ws stranded cost  the amount of stranded cost upon which mps receives a return is based on the difference between the actual contract price and the bid price for the facilities output received through a bid process overseen by the mpuc on a periodic basis 
the wheelabrator sherman nug contract expires in late however  mps chose to levelize its stranded cost payments from consumers  such that the recovery of stranded costs would be equal over a longer period of time  as opposed to higher consumer costs over a shorter recovery period  declining on an annualized basis 
consequently  the full recovery of ws related stranded costs will not occur until  although payments to ws cease beginning in as stranded costs decline  absolute returns will consequently decline as the rate base is reduced 
during the period through  mps will experience strong stranded cost freed up cash flows as a result of the end of the above market contract with ws and having levelized its stranded costs 
the deferment of stranded costs impacts stranded cost freed up cash flows  but will not impact net income 
due to mps s declining rate base as a result of deregulation  generation divestiture and amortization of stranded costs  combined with current stranded cost freed up cash flows forecasts during the period noted  management and page of the board of directors of mps determined that now is an opportune time to grow and diversify mps 
as a part of the overall strategy to grow  as noted  mam was formed as the holding company for mps and other subsidiaries and affiliated companies 
based on covenants agreed to between mps and the mpuc in forming the holding company  restrictions were placed on mam as it relates to the financial management of mps  helping to insulate the regulated utility from possible detrimental impacts of deregulated companies and diversification 
these covenants are described in greater detail in item  legal proceedings  item i a and item iii d 
mam s overall growth strategy consists of the following proposed strategic and tactical actions improve the overall operation and economic viability of mps ensure the effective operation of mps  ensuring its continued contribution to overall mam earnings and ensuring increased effectiveness of capital deployment based on return on capital employed roce evaluations 
improve overall mps transmission system security through the development of increased total and available transmission capacities  deploying capital for new construction based on a ferc allowed rate of return basis 
deploy capital based on the development and implementation of comprehensive year transmission and distribution system plans that seek to optimize reliability  while reducing required infrastructure 
implement integrated asset management systems and processes to improve overall reliability and extend assets lifecycles 
reorganize the utility  creating and increasing the operational responsibilities of field services  migrating increased decision making to the field 
improve overall management of mps through improved skill sets  business processes  and systems  including the installation of a new financial system with utility enterprise management components 
increase the overall integration and application of technologies to achieve increased productivity  such as installation of automated meter reading devices 
monitor rates to ensure such rates are fully compensatory and allow for achievement of allowable rates of return on equity  requesting rate increases as required from regulatory bodies 
pursue an acquisition strategy focusing on the roll up of regional mechanical and electrical engineering firms within new england and the eastern canadian provinces to provide a platform for additional growth and accretive net income to cover organic growth initiatives 
identify and pursue acquisitions of smaller regional mechanical and electrical engineering firms that have the ability to dominate individual local markets 
develop and implement franchised type systems  processes  products and services to support acquired engineering firms  limiting required integration issues and improving overall performance 
increase product offerings focused on facility lifecycle management utilizing an information based technology platform  providing clients turnkey development of asset assessments and asset lifecycle plans  including optimization of their capital expenditure programs 
increase service offerings in the areas of energy efficiency and air emissions reductions to complement fee for service engineering services 
as a part of facility lifecycle management services  identify and evaluate energy related assets that can be acquired  such as central utility plants and central heating and or cooling districts 
page of identify and evaluate the acquisition or start up of an energy supply management services company to complement engineering and facility lifecycle management services 
identify  evaluate and pursue the potential acquisition of other regulated or unregulated energy companies  such as small electric utilities or electric utility non generating assets  small natural gas local distribution companies  oil distributors and or propane distributors 
implement an aggressive acquisition analysis team to evaluate utility type assets and businesses within north america 
evaluate opportunities to leverage scale and synergies with mam s ownership of mps  a regulated transmission and distribution utility 
potential synergies include the following billing  credit collection and remittance services information technology services engineering services administrative and accounting services call center operations scada operations human resource related services focus on markets that provide a demographic and economic hedge to mps s service area 
focus on related businesses within markets that have a complimentary cash flow to offset mps s inverse bell curve stranded cost freed up cash flow 
identify  evaluate and pursue the potential acquisition of regional real estate development and management companies with an existing and diverse portfolio of real estate assets  focused on secondary and tertiary growth markets within the eastern canadian provinces 
ensure strong lease coverage of assets with an asset focus on public sector facilities  such as schools and government buildings  where leases match the term of financing 
focus on a portfolio of commercial and non retail properties in both downtown redevelopment districts and business park settings 
focus on the integration of engineering services in support of facility management 
focus on energy supply chain management optimization 
beyond the impacts of electric retail deregulation and generation divestiture  management closely monitors legislative activities and regulations 
both regulatory and legislative risks are the major risk concerns impacting mps 
management believes that as unregulated energy commodity prices increase  long term concerns exist that increased pressures will be placed on regulated distribution costs 
management anticipates that scale and technology will be the driving forces impacting the long term view of distribution and transmission assets 
accordingly  management has concluded that acquiring technology and additional businesses that utilize common services can create synergies that achieve scale  thus resulting in better control of increasing operating costs 
in order to enhance overall financial management capabilities and to ensure compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  mps is implementing a tier one financial system  which includes a utility enterprise management suite 
mps s need for an improved technology system  improved management financial reporting and full compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act has resulted in increased technology and accounting expenditures 
spreading these costs over a larger base of businesses is an important part of our overall strategy 
although mps is prohibited  except under certain  very limited regulatory exceptions  from owning and operating electric generation  management is closely evaluating generation resource conditions within northern maine and the page of canadian maritimes control area 
management believes that peaking capacity is a significant problem within the region and that this problem is currently exacerbated by uncertainties concerning the future and cost of orimulsion fuel supplies to generation facilities within new brunswick  canada  as well as the future of the point lepreau nuclear generation station also in new brunswick  canada 
the company has learned that the new brunswick department of energy has enlisted a nuclear expert to examine and give advice to the government on the potential refurbishment of the point lepreau nuclear generation station 
management believes the estimated anticipated cost of million cn to refurbish point lepreau  is a significant investment in generation that does not provide additional generation capacity to the region 
given these and other multi national issues  policies and decisions that impact generation supply planning and adequacy  management is concerned about the uncertainties relative to generation resources availability and the potential impact such uncertainties may have on mps s  and the company s future operations 
to address these resource availability concerns  mps is  among other things  evaluating additional transmission interconnections that could potentially increase its overall total and available transmission capacities with nb power 
mam anticipates that the effectiveness of these lines will in part be dependent upon the future of an additional kv transmission project currently jointly proposed by nb power and bangor hydro electric company  that would among other things provide an additional interconnection of nb power s system with the new england iso 
this kv transmission project is in the preliminary permit stages and it is not certain that it will be constructed 
management expects to re evaluate the mps transmission interconnections should this project not proceed 
due to the lack of sustainable profitability of ea and its risk profile  mam also intends to enhance its unregulated earnings over the next several years to replace those previously provided by ea 
mam will retain ea as a subsidiary and maintain its various licenses to ensure ea s option of returning to the retail electric sales market should conditions change and liquidity improve 
both the ability to raise the necessary capital and the availability of adequate investment capital to allow for full implementation of the mam strategic vision are critical success factors 
mam is evaluating a number of financing options  including the possible securitization of the above described stranded cost freed up cash flows see item above  business  discussion and description of the company s growth strategy 
resulting from deferred stranded cost recovery 
such a technique may require regulatory and or legislative approvals 
other options for financing may include  but are not limited  to the issuance of additional shares of stock  either common or preferred  and various forms of debt 
debt financing strategies may require that mam set a defined dividend policy providing guidance of a target payout range 
beyond issues related to capital formation  management anticipates that the effectiveness of mam s strategic vision and acquisition strategy will be greatly dependent upon the availability and quality of market opportunities 
management believes that by evaluating numerous local markets within the new england  us and atlantic canadian provinces  a greater number of small to mid range acquisition candidates are possible and is therefore focusing its efforts in these regions 
existing operations the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial results of the company and its subsidiaries mps  its electric transmission and distribution delivery company  and its wholly owned  inactive canadian subsidiary  me nb  ea  its ces retail electric marketing company  mames  dba the maricor group  and its canadian subsidiary  maricor  who provide mechanical and electrical engineering  energy efficiency  air emissions reduction  and lifecycle asset management services 
mps is an electric transmission and distribution delivery company serving approximately  retail electric customers in northern maine 
mps is subject to the regulatory authority of the mpuc for its distribution rates and the ferc for its transmission rates 
current rates are determined using traditional rate base  and rate of return ratemaking principals  including a cost of service methodology  used by the regulatory agencies 
other investor owned electric utilities within the state of maine are under alternative rate plans arp s and utilize page of performance based rates pbr s 
mps continues to evaluate the merits of an arp and possible migration to pbr s 
see part  item  legal proceedings item ii a above 
however  management believes that implementation of pbr s under an arp could result in detrimental financial impacts due to the lack of growth within mps s service area 
typically  arp s with pbr s require productivity offsets to achieve allowed rates of return and management believes such productivity offsets will not be achievable in the absence of economic growth 
mames  and its wholly owned canadian subsidiary  maricor  offer mechanical and electrical engineering services  including asset development  energy efficiency services  air emissions reduction services  and lifecycle asset management services 
in addition  mames and maricor offer a range of solutions to reduce facility lifecycle costs  identify and reduce deferred maintenance liabilities and improve environmental performance 
mames and maricor s value proposition encompasses the development  management  operation and modernization of physical assets for environmental and financial sustainability 
target markets within the eastern canadian provinces and atlantic canada primarily include  but are not necessarily limited to  governments  universities and colleges  hospitals and other health care facilities  schools  commercial retail and office facilities 
while not a target market  mames and maricor can and do provide engineering related services to the industrial sector 
mames and its subsidiary  maricor currently have offices in presque isle and portland  maine  rockland  massachusetts  and moncton and saint john  new brunswick  canada

this section and the accompanying text explain the general financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries and their results of operations 
this explanation includes factors that affect our business  the sources of our revenues and changes between years  our operating expenses and changes between years  the sources of our operating capital  and the impact of the above on our financial condition 
critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s most critical accounting policies include the determination of the appropriate accounting for its pensions and other post retirement benefits  the recognition of its revenues  the effects of utility regulation on its financial statements and its risk management activities 
revenue recognition mps records an estimate for revenue for electricity delivered  but not yet billed to customers 
this estimate requires mps to make certain assumptions 
a change in those assumptions could cause the amounts reported as revenues to change 
ea s previous sales can be classified into two general categories sos in cmp s service territory which page of expired february   and ces sales to individual retail customers within the state of maine  all of which expired by february  for sos  revenues were received and expenses were paid directly by an escrow agent which was controlled by engage energy america  llc engage 
ea received a percentage of the net profit from the sale of energy 
cmp bore sos account collection risks  as they were required to remit the amounts billed days after the billing date to the escrow account mentioned above and maintain the billing and customer service relationship 
ea recorded the accrued net margin of the sos activity as revenue in the financial statements 
for ces sales  ea negotiated the price directly with the customer  maintained customer service responsibility and had collection risk 
ea has withdrawn from the market until market conditions improve and no longer serves ces or sos customers 
ces activity is recorded on a gross basis to include the related revenues and purchased power expenses 
additionally  ea s activity has been accounted for as non trading since management has determined it does not meet the definition of a trader as defined in eitf which was amended by eitf refer to item a of this form k  note to the consolidated financial statements  energy atlantic for further discussion 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans the company has pension and other post retirement benefit plans  principally healthcare benefits  covering substantially all of its employees and retirees 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets are subject to various assumptions 
the primary assumptions include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  health care cost inflation rates  expected years of future service under the pension benefit plans and the methodology used to amortize gains or losses 
changes in those assumptions could also have a significant effect on the company s non cash pension income or expense or the company s post retirement benefit costs

utility regulation mps is subject to the regulatory authority of the mpuc and the ferc 
as a result of the ratemaking process  the applications of accounting principles by mps differ in certain respects from applications by non regulated businesses 
approximately of the company s revenues  as depicted in the operating revenues and energy deliveries section below  derived from mps s regulated operations are accounted for pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulations 
prior to the start of deregulation in maine on march   the mpuc determined the amount of stranded costs to be recovered via rates 
mps s annual amortization of its stranded costs represents the amounts allowed by the mpuc in the determination of revenue requirements 
results of operations earnings and dividends earnings per share and net income for  along with the corresponding information for and are as follows dollars in thousands net income mam mames mps core t d ea total company earnings per share due to the immateriality of elimination amounts  they have been grouped with appropriate line items page of net income above is allocated based upon the segment allocation as presented in item a of this form k  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  segment information 
as a part of the formation of the holding company  certain mps staff were transferred to mam 
also  certain administrative  legal  professional  governance  and professional costs were assigned to mam  following mpuc approved cost allocation process 
in addition  certain costs associated with merger and acquisition due diligence activities were included in mam costs 
in december   mam formed mames and mames canadian subsidiary  maricor 
in addition  during the same time frame maricor purchased eastcan consultants  a mechanical and electrical engineering firm headquartered in moncton  new brunswick  canada  with an office in saint john  new brunswick 
mps core t d earnings were  for  compared to  and  in and  respectively 
earnings for increased by  over earnings in sales in increased by over  contributing an additional  net of income taxes 
as more fully explained in the legal proceedings section of this form k  the mpuc allowed recovery  over seven years  of the verp expenses charged to earnings  resulting in an increase in net income of  net of income taxes  after considering two months of amortization 
in addition  reductions in transmission and distribution expenses of  net of income taxes  and in interest costs of  net of income taxes  also contributed to the increase in earnings 
offsetting these increases in earnings were additional expenses of  net of income taxes  associated with the approval of the holding company and increases in depreciation and amortization of  net of income taxes 
earnings for compared to were impacted by incremental charges for mps s voluntary early retirement program verp of  net of income taxes  and expenses associated with seeking approval for the formation of the holding company of  net of income taxes

the proceeds of any securities issued by mps will be used exclusively by mps for its business

energy atlantic activities ea s net loss for was  compared to net income of  and  for and  respectively 
ea s loss in reflects the gradual termination of service as contracts expire in northern maine 
the current standard offer pricing in maine  the lack of wholesale choices and liquidity within northern maine  and the increased credit requirements associated with acquiring wholesale electricity supply have hampered ea in competing for sales 
the company maintains a conservative risk management philosophy and has limited the transactions that ea can undertake as a buyer or seller in order to limit and mitigate potential transaction risk exposures 
ea earnings for and were impacted by settlements with its energy provider 
page of energy atlantic s historical energy sales can be classified into two general categories standard offer service sos in cmp s service territory which expired february   and competitive energy supply ces sales to individual retail customers within the state of maine 
effective february   ea no longer serves ces or sos retail customers and has discontinued service 
originally  ea obtained power for the sales in cmp s territory under an exclusive wholesale power sales agreement with engage energy america  llc 
during the third quarter  ea and engage concluded their business relationship pursuant to the terms of their agreement 
following completion of the final scheduled audit  the final escrow disbursements were made to ea and engage on september  as a result of the final account settlement  ea recognized the million of additional standard offer service sos revenue during the third quarter of with an after tax impact of million  or per share 
ea previously entered into a contract for of the output of the ws energy facility for the two years beginning march  and expiring on february  the output from this take or pay contract amounted to approximately  mwh annually and was being used to provide electricity for additional ces sales within mps s service territory 
this contract was a take or pay contract  which carried more counterparty risk than others entered into by ea 
to mitigate this risk  ea entered into a contract with nb power  whereby nb power committed to buy ws output in excess of load requirements in the mps service territory at a rate indexed to the price of sulphur max no 
residential oil into new york harbor  which was intended to reflect nb power s avoided cost  subject to a floor and ceiling 
all output was sold to ces customers  therefore limiting the risk that energy would be sold to nb power 
in addition  nb power committed to sell electricity to ea when load exceeded ws output at a fixed on and off peak rate 
in addition  ea had a power supply relationship with duke energy trading and marketing detm for electricity in cmp s service area 
in connection with this relationship  and certain transactions between ea and detm  mps provided a contractual guarantee on behalf of ea in an aggregate amount of one million dollars 
this guarantee was related specifically to the delivery and or receipt of electric power between ea and detm 
this guarantee was renewed in september of for an additional year 
effective march   detm agreed to waive this credit requirement in lieu of ea s commitment to maintain a million  minimum bank account balance 
on january   ea notified detm in writing of the impending expiration of the master service agreement between ea and detm on march  this correspondence was to notify detm of ea s expiration of its commitment to maintain a million  minimum account balance as credit coverage 
the following illustrates the types of risk ea was exposed to in connection with the contracts for supply and sales counterparty risk including the possibility of the other parties failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to ea such as a deliverability risk  referring to ea not being able to serve contracted load due to the supplier s failure to provide energy 
b transmission risk  indicating ea s reliance on utilities  such as the company  central maine power and bangor hydro electric  to physically transport energy to ea s customers 
c credit risk exposure  depending on ea s customers ability to pay  which may deteriorate during a general economic downturn or when a commercial customer experiences financial difficulty 
market liquidity risk encompasses the risk of being forced to buy or sell energy on the open market 
this would have occurred if energy had not been available from ws  nb power or other energy supply arrangements  while the contracted customer load must still be satisfied or if the existing customer load deteriorated and nb power could not buy the excess power from ws  as contracted 
page of forecasting risk exposure includes possible inaccuracy in the estimation of energy supply requirements 
one of ea s suppliers required a month forecast of load for each commitment to a mw block of energy 
although there was no penalty for not using all of the energy  ea could have been assessed a penalty for using more than the amount contracted 
market based cost risk is exposure to transactions tied to market indexes  such as the arrangement to sell excess ws power to nb power at a current market indexed rate 
with the expiration of the sos arrangement in cmp s service territory  ea has been adversely impacted by the decrease in revenues and correspondingly  earnings 
in  ea realized sos margin in cmp s service territory of approximately million  which included the final account settlement discussed above 
ea had no sos activity in on february   ea announced its intent to withdraw from the northern maine market due to the lack of profitability in that market  the lack of price differentiated electric products within the maritimes and northern maine independent system administrator markets  and the overall illiquidity of the wholesale power market  as well as other risk factors 
ea continued to serve its existing contracts in northern maine through their expiration on february  ces sales  primarily in northern maine  were approximately million in ea s decision to withdraw from the northern maine market not only minimized its risk profile  but ea believed this action would substantially relieve any underlying concerns that could exist in connection with the issue of employee sharing and ea s energy marketing activities within mps s service territory 
on february  mps filed with the mpuc an application for exemption of chapter to exempt the company and ea from certain management restrictions that have arisen due to this aspect of the corporate relationship 
mpuc docket no 

the proceeding is discussed above in item  legal proceedings item iii d 
in connection with its announced intent to withdraw from the retail electricity markets in northern maine  ea ceased all of its energy marketing activities in mps s service territory as well as the balance of the state  effective march  currently  ea is an inactive subsidiary and management has ceased all active retail ces activity on behalf of ea within the state of maine until market conditions  the availability of supply  the mandate for stringent credit requirements and risk environment improve

since the contract termination  maine yankee has managed the decommissioning project itself 
in december  maine yankee and federal insurance company federal entered into a settlement agreement resolving litigation between the parties  pursuant to which federal paid maine yankee million 
that amount represented full payment under the performance bond provided by federal  plus an additional amount under its payment bond reflecting certain payments previously made by maine yankee to subcontractors and suppliers who had not been fully paid by stone webster 
maine yankee deposited the payment in its decommissioning trust fund to offset past and future expenses resulting from the failures of stone webster 
page of in addition  maine yankee continued to pursue its claim for damages that was originally filed against stone webster and its then parent corporations in august  in the bankruptcy court in delaware 
after recognizing the payment from federal  maine yankee asserted a right to recover an additional million in that court from the bankruptcy estates 
after extensive interim proceedings and negotiations  in the third quarter of  the major parties agreed to a joint plan of reorganization under which maine yankee would have an allowed claim of million against the principal bankrupt estate  subject to certain contingencies 
under the plan  maine yankee would also have a first lien on any distributions from a related bankrupt estate in the proceeding on any amount needed to increase its actual cash recovery to million 
on january   maine yankee received an initial distribution of million  which it deposited in its decommissioning trust fund 
the amount of cash that maine yankee will actually recover on the balance of its claim remains contingent on a number of factors beyond maine yankee s control that affect the amount of bankrupt estate assets ultimately available to pay the claim 
maine yankee has settled its litigation claims against stone webster s bankruptcy estate and envirocare in connection with stone webster s bankruptcy proceeding see part  item  legal proceedings  item iii e 
federal legislation enacted in directed the department of energy doe to proceed with the studies necessary to develop and operate a permanent high level waste spent fuel repository at yucca mountain  nevada 
the project has encountered delays  and the doe has indicated that the permanent disposal site is not expected to open before  although originally scheduled to open in in accordance with the process set forth in the legislation  in february  the secretary of energy recommended the yucca mountain site to the president for the development of a nuclear waste repository  and the president then recommended development of the site to congress 
as provided in the statutory procedure  the state of nevada formally objected to the site in april  and in july  congress overrode the objection 
construction of the repository requires the approval of the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  upon application of the doe  and after a public adjudicatory hearing  as well as a second nrc approval after completion of construction to operate the facility 
maine yankee cannot predict the timing or results of those proceedings 
in november  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit confirmed the obligation of the doe under the nuclear waste policy act of to take responsibility for spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors in january after an unsuccessful effort by maine yankee in the same court to compel the doe to take maine yankee s spent fuel  in june  maine yankee filed a claim for money damages in the us court of federal claims for the costs associated with the doe s default 
in november  the court granted summary judgment in favor of maine yankee  ruling the doe had violated its contractual obligations  but leaving the amount of damages incurred by maine yankee for later determination by the court 
since then the parties have been engaged in extensive discovery and resolution of pre trial issues in the damages phase of the proceeding 
on june   the court denied three motions for summary judgment filed by the doe and indicated in its order that final pretrial submissions were to be due at the end of september  with a trial to follow shortly thereafter 
however  at the end of september  the doe requested an extension of time to complete its discovery  which was later granted  extending the discovery period to february  maine yankee is pursuing its claim for determination of damages vigorously  but cannot predict the outcome or timing of the determination 
at the same time  as an interim measure until the doe meets its contractual obligation to dispose of maine yankee s spent fuel at yucca mountain or elsewhere  maine yankee constructed an isfsi  utilizing dry cask storage  on the plant site and has completed the process of transferring the spent fuel from the spent fuel pool to the individual casks and the casks to the isfsi 
maine yankee s total cost of maintaining the isfsi will be substantially affected by heightened security costs and by the length of time it is required to operate the isfsi before the doe honors its contractual obligation to take the fuel from the site 
maine yankee s current decommissioning costs estimate is based on an assumption that its operation of the isfsi will end in  but the actual period of operation and cost may vary 
on january   maine yankee notified nac international nac  the contractor responsible for providing for the fabrication of the spent fuel casks and transferring the fuel to the casks and the casks to the isfsi  that maine yankee was terminating its contract with nac pursuant to the terms of the contract 
nac had been experiencing financial difficulties and had requested relief from the terms of the contract 
maine yankee believes that nac had also failed to perform its contractual obligations in accordance with the terms of the contract and provide adequate assurance of its ability to do so in the future 
nac disputed maine yankee s basis for terminating the contract and served maine yankee with a demand to arbitrate the dispute and a request for damages 
maine yankee  in turn  filed page of suit in the us district court for the district of maine against nac  its bonding company  and its parent guarantor  wherein maine yankee sought  among other things  damages due to nac s failure to perform 
maine yankee also entered into contracts with the major subcontractors and resumed the transfer of fuel to the isfsi under its own management 
in april  after extensive negotiations  the parties entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement resolving all the disputed issues and providing for maine yankee to replace nac in managing the completion of the fuel transfer work 
the settlement included a payment for million to maine yankee to compensate maine yankee for higher costs incurred or to be incurred as a result of nac s failure to perform its contractual obligations 
the payment was reflected in maine yankee s second quarter results 
although the nac dispute contributed to a slowdown in the progress of the fuel transfer work in the first quarter of  since then maine yankee has implemented additional efficiencies and the pace of work has improved to a point where it has been consistently exceeding the pre pace 
the transfer of spent fuel to the isfsi was completed in the first quarter of the federal low level radioactive waste policy amendments act  enacted in  required states  either alone or in multi state compacts  to provide for the disposal of low level radioactive waste generated within their borders 
the states of maine  texas and vermont entered into a compact for the disposal of low level waste over a year period at a then planned facility in west texas 
the terms of the compact provided that the state of maine would contribute million  payable in two equal installments  the first after ratification by congress and the second upon commencement of operation of the texas facility  or alternatively  if agreed by the three states  in accordance with the schedule for repayment of bonds issued for the development or operation of the facility 
by statute  those costs were to be initially assessed against maine yankee  as the operator of a nuclear power plant in maine 
as required by the act  the united states congress ratified the compact in september however  in october  the texas natural resource conservation commission denied a permit for the proposed west texas site  and efforts to site such a facility in texas were suspended 
maine yankee is shipping its low level waste to other facilities licensed to accept such material 
at its session  the maine legislature enacted legislation providing for the withdrawal of the state of maine from the texas compact pursuant to the terms of the compact 
the legislation cited the closure of the maine yankee plant and the inability of the state of texas to cause a disposal facility to be built in a timely manner under the compact as the reasons for initiating the withdrawal process 
however  in its session  the texas legislature enacted a bill that reactivated the process of siting a disposal facility in texas and provides for texas to seek payment from maine of million under the compact 
by letter dated september   the attorney general of texas requested payment of million from the state of maine  to which the state of maine responded by denying liability 
maine yankee believes that withdrawal from the compact by the state of maine is legally justified  but cannot predict the results of the texas legislation on the state of maine or maine yankee or of any attempt by any party to challenge the state of maine s withdrawal from the compact or to assess maine yankee for any payments under the compact 
on february   the nuclear regulatory commission approved maine yankee s license termination plan ltp 
the ltp was approved without any unexpected conditions
