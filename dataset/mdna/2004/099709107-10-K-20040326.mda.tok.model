actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates 
asset impairments the carrying value of long lived assets is evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in performing such reviews for recoverability  the company compares the expected cash flows to the carrying value of long lived assets for the applicable stores 
if the expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value 
expected future cash flows  which are estimated over each store s remaining lease term  contain estimates of sales and the impact those future sales will have upon cash flows 
future sales are estimated based  in part  upon a projection of each store s sales trend of the past several years 
additionally  each store s future cash contribution is based upon the most recent year s actual cash contribution  but is adjusted based upon projected trends in sales and store operating costs 
fair value is estimated using expected discounted future cash flows  with the discount rate approximating the company s borrowing rate 
significant deterioration in the performance of the company s stores compared to projections could result in significant additional asset impairments 
goodwill impairment pursuant to the provisions of fas  the company s goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
pursuant to fas  a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment a component  for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management 
the company s reporting units were identified as the operating segments borders  waldenbooks and corporate  and the country components of the international operating segment 
the carrying amounts of the net assets of the applicable reporting units including goodwill are compared to the estimated fair values of those reporting units 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model which depended on  among other factors  estimates of future sales and expense trends  liquidity and capitalization 
the discount rate used approximates the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
changes in any of the assumptions underlying these estimates may result in the future impairment of goodwill 
as of january   no impairment of goodwill existed 
inventory the carrying value of the company s inventory is affected by reserves for shrinkage and non returnable inventory 
projections of shrinkage are based upon the results of regular  periodic physical counts of the company s inventory 
the company s shrinkage reserve is adjusted as warranted based upon the trends yielded by the physical counts 
reserves for non returnable inventory are based upon the company s history of liquidating non returnable inventory 
the markdown percentages utilized in developing the reserve are evaluated against actual  ongoing markdowns of non returnable inventory to ensure that they remain consistent
