item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview genaera corporation is a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines for serious diseases from genomics and natural products 
our research and development efforts are focused on anti angiogenesis and respiratory diseases 
since commencing operations in  we have not generated any revenue from product sales  and we have funded operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of securities and research and development collaboration payments and related equity investments 
we have incurred a loss in each year since our inception  and we expect to incur substantial additional losses for at least the next several years 
we expect that losses may fluctuate  and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we will need to raise additional funds in the future to continue our operations 
the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations for each of the previous three years in the period ended december  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following are critical accounting policies important to our financial condition and results of operations presented in our financial statements and require management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that are inherently uncertain revenue recognition contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and for which there is no continuing involvement by us  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through development collaboration is recognized on a straight line basis over the development period 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
revenue under research and development cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as liabilities until earned 
payments received that are refundable also are classified as liabilities until the refund provision expires 
we make an estimate as to the appropriate deferral period for recognition of revenue on any collaborative fees received 
changes in these estimates  due to the evolution of the development program  can have a significant effect on the timing of revenue recorded 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include related salaries  contractor fees  and facility costs 
research and development expenses consist of independent research and development contract costs  contract manufacturing costs and costs associated with collaborative research and development arrangements 
in addition  we fund research and development at other research institutions under agreements that are generally cancelable 
research and development expenses also include external activities such as investigator sponsored trials 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense systematically as incurred  which may be measured by percentage of completion  contract milestones  patient enrollment or the passage of time 
at the initiation of certain contracts  we must make an estimate as to the duration and expected completion date of the contract  which may require a change due to accelerations  delays or other adjustments to the contract period or work performed 
changes in these estimates could have a significant effect on the amount of research and development costs in a specific period 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation under the intrinsic value based method set forth by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
effective january   we adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
stock or other equity based compensation for non employees must be accounted for under the fair value based method as required by sfas and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and other related interpretations 
under this method  the equity based instrument is valued at either the fair value of the consideration received or the equity instrument issued on the date of grant 
the resulting compensation cost is recognized and charged to operations over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
estimating the fair value of equity securities involves a number of judgments and variables that are subject to significant change 
a change in the fair value estimate could have a significant effect on the amount of compensation cost 
results of operations vs 
revenues we have received no revenues to date from product sales 
revenues recorded to date have consisted principally of revenues recognized under collaborations with third parties 
in april  we entered into a research collaboration and licensing agreement with medimmune  inc to develop and commercialize therapies related to our il program 
medimmune provided funding of million  payable in eight equal quarterly installments through april  plus funds external cost reimbursements for our research and development activities 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  in revenue related to this agreement  of which million and million  respectively  related to external cost reimbursements 
in february  the company received a phase ii small business innovative research program grant from the national institutes of health in the amount of  to support our aminosterol research program 
the grant extends over the two year period beginning in february the company recognized  as revenue related to this grant in the periods ending december  research and development expenses we recognized research and development expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist principally of personnel costs  contract research  development and manufacturing costs and facility costs 
research and development expenses have decreased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due to reduced manufacturing efforts million  the absence of a one time accrual of severance and related costs associated with our realignment of operations in august and november of million  as well as reduced continuing payroll and related costs associated with our realignment of operations in million 
these reductions were partially offset by increased development efforts in squalamine million 
the level of research and development expenses in future periods will depend principally upon the progress of our research and development programs and our capital resources 
general and administrative expenses we recognized general and administrative expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel costs  professional fees and public company expenses 
general and administrative costs decreased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due principally to reduced payroll and related costs associated with our realignment of operations in million  gains from the sale of excess research equipment million  the absence of a one time accrual of severance and related costs associated with our realignment of operations in august and november of million  as well as continuing cost containment initiatives 
these reductions were partially offset by small increases in several categories of general corporate expenses 

table of contents interest income and expense we recognized interest income of million and million in and  respectively 
we recognized interest expense of million and million in and  respectively 
interest income is primarily comprised of income generated from cash and investments 
interest expense is primarily comprised of expense related to our indebtedness to a bank 
interest income decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due to declining investment interest yields and lower average investment balances 
interest expense decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year due to the repayment of our indebtedness to a bank

research and development expenses we recognized research and development expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist principally of personnel costs  contract research  development and manufacturing costs and facility costs 
research and development expenses have decreased marginally in the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due to reduced squalamine manufacturing and trodusquemine development efforts 
these reductions were partially offset by the  and  accruals of research and development employee severance and related costs associated with our realignment of operations in august and november of  respectively 
general and administrative expenses we recognized general and administrative expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel costs  professional fees and public company expenses 
such expenses decreased in the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due principally to decreases in personnel related to general corporate activities

interest expense is primarily comprised of expense related to our indebtedness to a bank 
interest income decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due to declining investment interest yields and lower average investment balances 
liquidity and capital resources cash and investments were million at december  as compared to million at december  the primary use of cash was to finance our research and development operations 

table of contents since inception  we have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of our securities totaling approximately million since our initial public offering in december and including the proceeds from the following private placements of our securities  net of costs  in  and million april  million april  million may  and million november in addition to the above  we have funded our operations from contract and grant revenues  research and development expense reimbursements  interest income  lease financing and debt financing 
our goal is to conduct significant research  pre clinical development  clinical testing and manufacturing activities over the next several years 
we expect that these activities  together with projected general and administrative expenses  will result in continued and significant losses 
current liabilities decreased by million from million at december  to million at december   due primarily to the maturity and payment of the company s million note payable in june of the decrease in current liabilities was partially offset by the reclassification of million of long term liability payable to abbot to short term liabilities  as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from the timing and magnitude of our current development contracts 
prior to  we had an agreement with abbott providing for the purchase of approximately million of bulk drug substance for locilex cream 
as fda approval of locilex cream did not occur  we renegotiated this agreement with abbott in  paying abbott million and receiving partial delivery of material 
an additional million was due to abbott and payable if we receive in excess of million of additional funds in any year beginning in  in which case of such excess over million shall be payable to abbott 
we have no further purchase commitments to abbott  and abbott has no further supply requirements to us 
as a result of the company s financing activities during and and other cash inflows  million and million of this liability was payable and paid to abbott on march  and  respectively 
no portion of the liability was payable to abbott on march  as the company did not receive in excess of million of cash inflows during as a result of the company s financing activities during and other cash inflows  million of the remaining liability is due and payable to abbott on march  and is included in short term liabilities as of december  the remaining amount of million is included in long term liabilities as of december  our capital expenditure requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the time and cost required to obtain regulatory approvals  our ability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements  the demand for products based on our technology  if and when such products are approved  and possible acquisitions of products  technologies and companies 
we had no significant capital commitments as of december  in april  we entered into a research collaboration and licensing agreement and a preferred stock purchase agreement with medimmune pursuant to which we received million 
medimmune has funded million plus external cost reimbursements for our research and development activities through april during and  funding of million and million  respectively  had been received from medimmune 
of that amount  million and million during and  respectively  was specifically related to the million research and development funding  with the remainder comprised of external cost reimbursements 
we regularly explore alternative means of financing our operations and seek funding through various sources  including public and private securities offerings  collaborative arrangements with third parties and other strategic alliances and business transactions 
we currently do not have any commitments to obtain additional funds  and may be unable to obtain sufficient funding in the future on acceptable terms 
if we cannot obtain funding  we will need to delay  scale back or eliminate research and development programs or enter into collaborations with third parties to commercialize potential products or technologies that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or seek other arrangements 
if we engage in collaborations  we may receive lower consideration upon commercialization of such products than if we had not entered into such arrangements  or if we entered into such arrangements at later stages in the product development process 
additional factors that may impact our ability to raise capital are described under risk factors related to our business 

table of contents in january  we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately million 
we believe that the proceeds of this offering in addition to our current cash and investments at december   are sufficient to meet our research and development goals and sustain operations at least through contractual cash obligations the table below sets forth our contractual obligations at december  in thousands cash payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years abbott settlement operating lease on building operating leases and maintenance contracts on equipment r d contracts clinical trial contracts manufacturing contracts total contractual cash obligations payable if we receive in excess of million of additional funds in any year beginning in  in which case of such excess over million shall be payable to abbott 
the lease provides for escalations relating to increases in the consumer price index not to exceed but no less than beginning in december we have assumed a minimum lease payment escalation of for the purposes of this table 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with interest rate changes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in only us government debt instruments that meet high quality credit standards  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure we may have to any one issue  issuer or type of investment 
as of december   our portfolio investments consisted of million in cash and million in us government or us government agency debt instruments having a maturity of less than one year 
due to the nature of our investment portfolio  management believes that a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that if the average annualized yield of our investments had decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the annualized yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
correspondingly  if the average annualized yield of our investments had increased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have increased by  this estimate assumes that the increase occurred on the first day of and increased the annualized yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk
