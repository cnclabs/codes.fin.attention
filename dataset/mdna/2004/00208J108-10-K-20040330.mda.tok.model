table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview general atp oil gas corporation is engaged in the acquisition  development and production of natural gas and oil properties in the gulf of mexico and the north sea 
we seek to acquire and develop properties with proved undeveloped reserves pud that are economically attractive to us but are not strategic to major or large exploration oriented independent oil and gas companies 
we believe that our strategy provides assets for us to develop and produce without the risk  cost or time of exploration 
we seek to create value and reduce operating risks through the acquisition and development of proved natural gas and oil reserves in areas that have significant undeveloped reserves  close proximity to developed markets for natural gas and oil  existing infrastructure of natural gas and oil pipelines and production processing platforms  and a relatively stable regulatory environment for offshore natural gas and oil development and production 
we focus on acquiring properties that contain proved undeveloped reserves that have become non core or non strategic to their original owners for a variety of reasons 
for example  larger oil companies from time to time adjust their capital spending or shift their focus to exploration prospects which they believe offer greater reserve potential 
some projects provide lower economic returns to a larger company due to its cost structure within that company 
also  due to timing or budget constraints  a company may be unwilling or unable to develop a property before the expiration of the lease 
because of our efficient cost structure  expertise in our areas of focus and ability to develop projects  the properties may be more financially attractive to us than the seller 
given our strategy of acquiring properties that contain proved reserves  our operations are lower risk than exploration focused gulf of mexico and north sea operators 
as a result of this strategy  we have successfully brought out of proved undeveloped reserve projects to commercial production since our inception 
by focusing on properties that are not strategic to other companies and properties that are primarily proved but as yet undeveloped  we are able to minimize up front acquisition costs and concentrate available capital on the development phase of these properties 
since our inception in through december   we have added bcfe of proved natural gas and oil reserves through acquisitions at a total cost of million or per mcfe 
development costs for this same period were approximately million 
at december   we had net proved reserves of bcfe  of which are located in the gulf of mexico and the remaining in the north sea 
the pre tax pv of our proved reserves at december  was million 
of the total proved reserves  approximately bcfe are proved undeveloped reserves  which represent more than three years of future development opportunities based on current expectations 
we currently have nineteen properties that have proved undeveloped reserves scheduled for future development  including sixteen in the gulf of mexico  two in the uk sector north sea and one in the dutch sector north sea 
we focus on developing projects in the shortest time possible between initial significant investment and first revenue generated in order to maximize our rate of return 
since we operate a significant number of the properties in which we acquire a working interest  we are able to significantly influence the development concept and timing of a project s development 
we typically initiate new development projects by simultaneously obtaining the various required components such as the pipeline and the production platform or subsea well completion equipment 
we believe this strategy  combined with our ability to evaluate and implement a project s requirements  allows us to efficiently complete the development project and commence production 

table of contents to enhance the economics and return on investment of a project  we sometimes develop the project to a value creation point and either sell an interest or bring in partners during the high capital development phase on a promoted basis 
in  we sold a interest in our helvellyn project in the uk sector north sea after we had obtained field development approval for the project and finalized contractual commitments 
in  we sold interests in three projects in the gulf of mexico on a promoted basis to reduce the amount of capital employed 
we continued this practice into whereupon we sold of our interest in seven projects containing ten offshore blocks in the gulf of mexico for million  approximately mcfe for proved reserves  of which are proved undeveloped reserves 
review of was a transitional year for atp 
most of our development activities during the year were focused on positioning us for success in the future 
a considerable amount of our capital expenditures during the year will result in significantly enhanced production in and beyond 
we began activities at our matia cabrito and ship shoal ss developments in the first quarter of  with significant expenditures beginning late in the second quarter through the end of the year 
there are two initial wells at each of the two developments 
the well at matia had been completed and was producing at year end 
another significant portion of our capital outlay was devoted to our first north sea development  helvellyn  originally scheduled to be placed on production during the spring of after a successful well test in january of mmcf day net 
however  due to delays that were beyond our control  expected first production was pushed back to the fall of at that time a down hole problem was encountered ultimately requiring a side track of the well from approximately 
the helvellyn well was successfully completed and placed on production on february  and is currently producing approximately mmcf day net 
the significant capital required to develop our matia cabrito and ss properties combined with the additional costs of unexpected delays in establishing first production from helvellyn resulted in a constrained liquidity position for us 
further compounding this position was the decrease in production due to natural declines in our producing gulf of mexico properties 
this decrease was not offset with production from new developments due to the relatively small amount of capital  million  spent on our gulf of mexico drilling operations in compared to million spent in generally  capital spent on drilling in one year will result in increased production the following year 
consequently  natural gas and oil production decreased approximately from to bcfe 
we received an average realized price of per mcfe  less than the average market sales price  due to our hedging positions throughout the year 
in order to improve our liquidity position and fund the current developments already in progress  we took several proactive steps throughout the year 
in may of we received million in net proceeds through an equity offering of four million shares of our common stock 
in august  we materially modified our then existing credit agreement and expanded our borrowing base from approximately million to million 
in november and december  we amended the credit agreement and increased the borrowing base to million by pledging our assets in the uk sector north sea 
even with a constrained liquidity position during the year  we were able to significantly add to our reserve base and we are proud of this accomplishment 
during we added proved reserves  primarily through acquisitions  of approximately bcfe in the gulf of mexico and approximately bcfe in the north sea resulting in a net reserve replacement and an overall increase of in proved reserves from the end of 
table of contents in a private transaction with a third party we acquired a working interest in mississippi canyon gomez  the largest acquisition we have made in the gulf of mexico 
gomez  comprising approximately of our gulf of mexico reserves with initial development costs of approximately million  will be part of our development program primarily in prior to our ownership  six wells were drilled on gomez 
four wells are temporarily abandoned and are re enterable 
we plan to re enter two wells in the southern portion and establish production from two reservoirs in subsequently  we plan to re enter two wells in the northern portion of the block 
as we develop this property we may  as we have done with other projects  elect to bring in partners on a promoted basis to reduce our portion of the capital commitment 
in we expanded our north sea operation into the dutch sector with the acquisition of block l d 
this block is scheduled to be part of our and development program 
we also expanded our inventory of properties in the uk sector north sea with the offering by the dti of two licenses in the st licensing round for two blocks in the emerald field 
these blocks are currently being evaluated by atp and accordingly no reserves have been recorded at december  as we complete the development plans for the emerald field in  we expect to record proved reserves associated with this property upon completion of our evaluation 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
operational and financial objectives we believe that production will exceed that of as a result of our development program in the gulf of mexico and the commencement of production from helvellyn in the north sea during february with the initial production from helvellyn  we achieved commercial production from our first north sea development 
the projected production should also command a higher realized price than in recent years due to the expiration of our relatively low priced hedging contracts  most of which were put in place in our revenues  profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon many factors  particularly our production results and the price of natural gas and oil 
price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years 
throughout and  the nymex futures market reported relatively high natural gas and oil contract prices 
to lock in these attractive prices  we currently have derivative instruments in place which hedge bcfe and bcfe of estimated volumes for and  respectively  at an average price of per mcfe and mcfe  respectively 
the income tax expense of million in was primarily due the company recording a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax asset as required by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas provides for the weighing of positive and negative evidence in determining whether a deferred tax asset is recoverable 
we have incurred net operating losses in and prior years 
relevant accounting guidance suggests that cumulative losses in recent years constitute significant negative evidence  and that future expectations about income are overshadowed by such history of losses 
delays in bringing properties on to production and development cost overruns in were also significant factors considered in evaluating our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
if we achieve profitable operations in  we may reverse a portion of the valuation allowance in an amount at least sufficient to eliminate any tax provision in that period 
we expect a significant increase in production over as a result of the development activities at our helvellyn  matia cabrito and ss developments during and the first quarter of this increased production combined with higher realized prices should result in a substantial increase in our results of operations 
we have budgeted approximately to million for development operations on nine properties with undeveloped reserves in the gulf of mexico and approximately to million in the north sea 
of particular note is that eight of the nine gulf of mexico developments are on properties with existing infrastructure platforms and pipelines which should significantly decrease the time from initial capital expenditures to first production 
in the first quarter of  we sold of our interest in seven projects containing ten offshore blocks in the gulf of mexico for million  approximately mcfe for proved reserves  of which are proved undeveloped reserves 
recent developments in order improve our liquidity position and to ensure we are able to develop our reserves as projected  we entered into a new senior secured term loan on march  as more fully disclosed in liquidity and capital resources new term loan  our new term loan is million of which million is a senior secured first lien term loan facility and million is a senior secured second lien term loan facility term loan 
the term loan matures in march and is secured by substantially all of our oil and gas assets in the gulf of mexico and the uk sector north sea 
we used million of the proceeds of the term loan to repay in full our previous credit facility and recognized a non cash loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million in the first quarter of at closing  we received net proceeds of approximately million after repaying our previous credit facility and fees associated with the transaction

accretion of asset retirement obligation pursuant to the requirements of sfas which we adopted on january   we recorded accretion expense totaling million associated with our oil and gas asset retirement obligations 
loss on abandonment during  we recognized a loss on abandonment of million 
of this amount  approximately million was attributable to actual costs exceeding the original estimates on two properties

in addition  we incurred significant standby time as a result of hurricane claudette 
loss on unsuccessful property acquisition atp and legacy were in a dispute over a contract for the sale of an oil and gas property 
atp paid million to legacy on october  to extend the closing date of the proposed acquisition to october  while working on the closing of the property with atp after october   legacy sold the property to a third party without informing atp until after the closing

table of contents other in the fourth quarter of  we filed an insurance claim covering the estimated damages and lost production from the gulf of mexico region resulting from the effects of hurricane lili in october at december   we recorded amounts recoverable  net of deductibles  of approximately million for damages to ten properties and lost production on four properties through december  during  we received an additional million for damages incurred  based upon the final agreed upon claim with the underwriters 
income taxes the income tax expense of million in was primarily due to the company recording a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax asset as required by sfas see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million 
in compliance with the definition of working capital in our credit facility  we had a working capital deficit of approximately million at december  this definition excludes current maturities of long term debt  the current portion of assets and liabilities from derivatives and the current portion of asset retirement obligations as well as including availability under the borrowing base 
in the past  we have reported deficits in working capital at the end of a period 
such working capital deficits have principally been the result of accounts payable related to ongoing development activities 
settlement of these payables has primarily been funded by cash flow from operations or  if necessary  by availability on our credit facility 
the working capital deficiency was primarily a result of the significant capital required to develop our matia cabrito and ss properties combined with unexpected delays in establishing first production from helvellyn 
there are two initial wells each at the matia cabrito and ss developments 
the well at matia had been completed and was producing at year end and the first well at ss started producing in march another significant portion of our capital outlay was devoted to our first north sea development  helvellyn  originally scheduled to be placed on production during the early part of after a successful well test in january however  due to delays that were beyond our control  expected first production was pushed back to the fall of at that time a down hole problem was encountered ultimately requiring a side track of the well from approximately 
the helvellyn well was successfully completed and placed on production on february  and is currently producing at its original test rates of mmcf day net 
the remaining costs to be expended through the remainder of for these three major developments are projected to be approximately million 
further compounding our tight liquidity position was the decrease in production due to natural declines in our gulf of mexico properties 
consequently  natural gas and oil production decreased approximately from to bcfe 
we received an average realized price of per mcfe  less than the average sales price  due to our hedging position throughout the year 
our working capital position has significantly improved as a result of the million sale in of of our interest in seven projects containing ten offshore blocks in the gulf of mexico  of which million was received in february and million will be received in april in addition  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the closing of our new term loan after repayment of borrowings under our prior credit facility 
we anticipate that our working capital position will be further improved by  among other things  increased production from our matia cabrito and ss developments in the gulf of mexico and the recently completed helvellyn well in the north sea 

table of contents however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production from our properties  natural gas and oil prices and the impact  if any  of commitments and contingencies 
mandatory repayments under our new term loan are subject to variables including our ebitda as defined  changes in the prices of natural gas and oil and changes in our oil and gas reserves 
a material required reduction in the amount outstanding under the new credit facility would have a material negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to fund future obligations 
no assurance can be given that operations and other capital resources as described above will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of operations and capital expenditures

changes in working capital provided million in cash flows in primarily due to an increase in capital projects late in as compared to the remaining changes in working capital were due to timing of receipts and disbursements in the ordinary course of business 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities increased in to million of which million was for acquisition and development activities 
we incurred acquisition costs of million in the gulf of mexico and developmental costs of million and million in the gulf of mexico and north sea  respectively

amounts borrowed under our credit agreements were as follows for the dates indicated in thousands december  credit facility note payable  net of unamortized discount of total debt credit facility on august   we entered into a material modification of our prior credit facility in the form of an amendment  whereby the prior lenders were replaced and the terms were modified 
under the amended agreement  the borrowing base was redetermined and was established at million 
the amended facility was secured by all of our us assets in addition to approximately two thirds of the capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries and was guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiary  atp energy 
the borrowing base was 
table of contents reviewed monthly and if our outstanding balance exceeded our borrowing base at any time  we were required to repay such excess immediately 
the material modification to the credit facility also extended the term of the facility to mature in august on november  the credit facility was amended to modify certain debt covenants and contemplated expanding the borrowing base by up to million  subject to terms mutually acceptable to both parties  by pledging the oil and gas properties in the uk sector of the north sea 
on december   we executed a second amendment to our credit agreement  which implemented the million tranche maturing on february   established a borrowing base coverage test of commencing february   modified several of the financial covenants and added new reporting and compliance covenants and events of default 
we incurred fees of million in connection with the execution of the first and second amendments which have been reflected in the financial statements as of december   of which million has been capitalized 
advances under the original tranches of the credit facility bore interest at the base rate plus a margin of to  depending on the amount outstanding 
the average effective interest rate on these tranches was approximately per annum 
advances under the million tranche bore interest at the rate of per annum 
the borrowing base was reviewed monthly and if our outstanding balance exceeded our borrowing base at any time  we were required to repay such excess immediately 
the terms of the agreement at december   including the amendments discussed above  required us to maintain certain covenants including a current ratio  as defined in the agreement  of through december  and monthly thereafter  a consolidated debt coverage ratio which is not greater than beginning october  with ranges from to monthly through august  and monthly thereafter  a domestic debt coverage ratio which is not greater than beginning october  with ranges from to monthly through january  and monthly thereafter  a consolidated and domestic interest coverage ratio which is not less than  and the requirement to maintain hedges on no less than and no more than of the next twelve months of forecasted production attributable to our proved producing reserves

on february  we finalized the third amendment to the credit agreement which was effective as of february  the third amendment extended the maturity of the million tranche to january   reduced the borrowing base coverage test from of the amounts outstanding under our credit facility to  extended the measuring date for such test from february  to april   imposed a new borrowing base reserve of million at april  and provided waivers for the aforementioned non compliance of certain covenants 
as consideration for the execution of the third amendment  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  exercisable at a price of per share 
the million tranche at december  has been classified as long term because of our intent and ability to refinance such amount on a long term basis through the new term loan discussed below 
on march  we executed a fourth amendment to extend to march  the time allowed to place hedges on our north sea production 
at december   we had a million senior secured revolving credit facility which was secured by substantially all of our us oil and gas properties  as well as by approximately two thirds of the capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries and was guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiary  atp energy  inc the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility was limited to the loan value  as determined by the bank  of the oil and gas properties pledged under the facility 
on august   this credit facility was amended to replace the lenders and the outstanding balance was repaid 

table of contents new term loan on march   we entered into a new million term loan of which million is a senior secured first lien term loan facility and million is a senior secured second lien term loan facility term loan 
the term loan matures in march it is secured by substantially all of our oil and gas assets in the gulf of mexico and the uk sector north sea and is guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries atp energy and atp oil gas uk limited 
we used million of the proceeds of the term loan to repay in full our previous credit facility in effect at december  and recognized a non cash loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million in the first quarter of at closing  we received net proceeds of million after repaying our previous credit facility  the repurchase of  warrants associated with the previous credit facility and fees associated with the transaction 
the term loan was issued at an average interest rate of and an original issue discount of which was capitalized and will be amortized over the life of the term loan 
the million term loan bears interest at the base rate plus a margin of or libor with a floor plus a margin of at the election of atp 
beginning in october  the margin will increase from to 
the million term loan bears interest at the base rate plus a margin of or libor with a floor plus a margin of at the election of atp 
in connection with the issuance of the term loan we paid fees and expenses of million and granted warrants to purchase  shares of common stock of atp for per share 
the warrants have a term of six years and expire in march we expect to record these fees and the fair market value of the warrants issued as debt financing costs in the first quarter of these amounts will be amortized over the life of the term loan using the effective interest method 
the terms of term loan require us to maintain certain covenants which are tested on a quarterly basis beginning june  capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the term loan 
the covenants include current ratio of  consolidated net debt to ebitax coverage ratio which is not greater than at june   at september  and december   at each of the quarters ending in and and for each of the quarters ending thereafter  consolidated ebitdax to interest expense which is not less than during and thereafter  pv of our total proved developed producing oil and gas reserves to net debt of at least  pv of our total proved oil and gas reserves to net debt of at least net debt to proved developed oil and gas reserves of less than mcfe in  mcfe in and per mcfe in and thereafter  and the requirement to maintain hedges on no less than and no more than of the next twelve months of forecasted production attributable to our proved producing reserves 
we expect that we will be in compliance with the financial covenants under our new term loan for the next twelve months 
however  adverse changes in our expected production levels and reserves or material delays or cost overruns in could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations and result in our non compliance with these covenants 

table of contents note payable in june  we issued a note payable to a purchaser for a face principal amount of million which was to mature in june and bore interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the note was secured by second priority liens on substantially all of our us oil and gas properties and was subordinated in right of payment to our existing senior indebtedness 
we executed an agreement in connection with the note which contains conditions and restrictive provisions and requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
the expected repayment premium was amortized to interest expense straight line  over the term of the note which approximated the effective interest method 
the discount of million was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method 
the resulting liability was included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december  on august  and in connection with the execution of our amended credit agreement  we paid million to the holder of the note payable to settle all outstanding obligations under the note agreement 
those obligations included principal  accrued interest and early repayment premiums 
upon repayment of the note payable and replacement of the prior lenders of the credit facility  we recorded a million total loss on the extinguishment in third quarter of  million of which was related to non cash deferred financing costs 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  recently issued accounting pronouncements  to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations we have various commitments primarily related to leases for office space  other property and equipment and other agreements 
the following table summarizes certain contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years after years long term debt non cancelable operating leases contractor commitment total contractual obligations does not include any amounts related to contingencies discussed below 
includes interest based on rates and monthly reduction amounts in effect at december  critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
such estimates and judgments are evaluated and modified as necessary on an ongoing basis 
significant estimates include dd a of proved oil and gas properties 
oil and gas reserve estimates  which are the basis for unit of production dd a and the impairment analysis  are inherently imprecise and are expected to change as future information becomes available 
in addition  alternatives may exist among various accounting methods 
in such cases  the choice of accounting method may also have a significant impact on reported amounts 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies discussed below and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our company 

table of contents oil and gas property accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies may elect to account for their property costs using either the successful efforts or full cost accounting method 
under the successful efforts method  lease acquisition costs and intangible drilling and development costs on successful wells and development dry holes are capitalized 
selection of the oil and gas accounting method can have a significant impact on a company s financial results 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting and generally pursue acquisitions and development of proved reserves as opposed to exploration activities 
capitalized costs relating to producing properties are depleted on the units of production method 
proved developed reserves are used in computing unit rates for drilling and development costs and total proved reserves for depletion rates of leasehold  platform and pipeline costs 
estimated dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs and estimated residual salvage values are taken into account in determining amortization and depletion provisions 
expenditures for geological and geophysical testing costs are generally charged to expense unless the costs can be specifically attributed to determining the placement for a future developmental well location 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred  renewals and betterments are capitalized 
the costs and related accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization of properties sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts  and gains or losses on disposition are reflected in the statements of operations 
costs directly associated with the acquisition and evaluation of unproved properties are excluded from the amortization base until the related properties are evaluated 
unproved properties are periodically assessed and any impairment in value is charged to impairment expense 
the costs of unproved properties which are determined to be productive are transferred to proved oil and gas properties and amortized on a unit of production 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties 
this method requires us to amortize the capitalized costs incurred in developing a property in proportion to the amount of oil and gas produced as a percentage of the amount of proved reserves contained in the property 
accordingly  changes in reserve estimates as described above will cause corresponding changes in depletion expense recognized in periods subsequent to the reserve estimate revision 
our gulf of mexico and netherlands reserves quantities are prepared annually by independent petroleum engineers ryder scott company  lp and our lp sector north sea reserves are prepared annually by independent petroleum consultants troy ikoda limited 
see the supplemental information unaudited in our consolidated financial statements for reserve data related to our properties 

table of contents impairment analysis we perform an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment allowance is provided on an unproved property when we determine that the property will not be developed 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineer s estimate of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions and actual or planned drilling or other development activities 
for a property determined to be impaired  an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the impaired property will be recognized 
fair value  on a depletable unit basis  is estimated to be the present value of the aforementioned expected future net cash flows 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  impairment and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil and gas wells  dismantling our offshore production platforms  and the removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and returning such land to its original condition 
sfas requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation  discount it to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation  the expected future date of the required cash payment  and interest and inflation rates 
revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates  the timing of settlement  and changes in legal requirements 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis 
see note  asset retirement obligations  to the consolidated financial statements 
contingent liabilities in preparing financial statements at any point in time  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings and the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are involved in actions from time to time  which if determined adversely  could have a material negative impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
management  with the assistance of counsel makes estimates  if determinable  of atp s probable liabilities and records such amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
such estimates may be the minimum amount of a range of probable loss when no single best estimate is determinable 
disclosure is made  when determinable  of any additional possible amount of loss on these claims  or if such estimate cannot be made  that fact is disclosed 
along with our counsel  we monitor developments related to these legal matters and  when appropriate  we make adjustments to recorded liabilities to reflect current facts and circumstances 
although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  management believes that the recorded amounts  if any  are reasonable 

table of contents price risk management activities we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts and fixed price physical contracts to manage our exposure to natural gas and oil price volatility 
we primarily utilize fixed price physical contracts and price swaps  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counter parties of high credit quality that we believe are minimal credit risks 
the natural gas and oil reference prices of these commodity derivatives contracts are based upon crude natural gas and oil futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices we receive 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
for qualifying fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is offset by related results of the hedged item in the income statement 
gains and losses on hedging instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to natural gas and oil sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded in natural gas and oil revenues 
as of december   we did not have any derivative contracts in place that qualified as a cash flow hedge 
valuation of deferred tax asset we compute income taxes in accordance with sfas the standard requires an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of those assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires the recording of a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
sfas provides for the weighing of positive and negative evidence in determining whether a deferred tax asset is recoverable 
we have incurred net operating losses in and prior years 
relevant accounting guidance suggests that cumulative losses in recent years constitute significant negative evidence  and that future expectations about income are overshadowed by such history of losses 
delays in bringing properties on to production and development cost overruns in were also significant factors considered in evaluating our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance of million as of december  see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  no compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of options equals the fair value market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 

table of contents other matters a reporting issue has risen for companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the issue is whether sfas requires registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  we have included the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  we would be required to reclassify approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  out of oil and gas properties and into a separate intangible assets line item 
our cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with successful efforts accounting rules  as allowed by sfas further  we do not believe the classification of the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets would have any impact on our compliance with covenants under our debt agreements 
we will continue to classify our oil and gas leasehold costs as tangible oil and gas properties until further guidance is provided 
we anticipate there will be no effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the interest rate paid on borrowings under the credit facility 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
foreign currency risk 
the net assets  net earnings and cash flows from our wholly owned subsidiaries in the uk and the netherlands are based on the uk dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the applicable functional currency 
these foreign operations have the potential to impact our financial position due to fluctuations in the local currency arising from the process of re measuring the local functional currency in the us dollar 
we have not utilized derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge the risk associated with the movement in foreign currencies 
commodity price risk our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our bank credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can economically produce 
we currently sell a portion of our natural gas and oil production under price sensitive or market price contracts 
we periodically use derivative instruments to hedge our commodity price risk 
we hedge a portion of our projected natural gas and oil production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support natural gas and oil prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations 
we may use futures contracts  swaps and fixed price physical contracts to hedge our commodity prices 
realized gains and losses from our price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas sales when the associated production occurs 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the unrecognized gains and losses are included as a component of other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents our internal hedging policy provides that we examine the economic effect of entering into a commodity contract with respect to the properties that we acquire 
we generally acquire properties at prices that are below the management s estimated value of the estimated proved reserves at the then current natural gas and oil prices 
we may enter into short term hedging arrangements if we are able to obtain commodity contracts at prices sufficient to secure an acceptable internal rate of return on a particular property or on a group of properties or if deemed necessary by the terms of our existing credit agreements 
during  we hedged approximately of our natural gas and oil production
