table of contents overview our business we own  operate and develop self storage properties in principal cities in the us and europe 
headquartered in seattle  washington  we operate as a reit 
since our founding in  shurgard and its predecessor company has steadily grown its self storage investment business 
we own or lease  directly and through our subsidiaries and joint ventures  properties containing approximately million net rentable square feet and manage for third parties properties containing approximately million rentable square feet 
today we are estimated to be one of the largest self storage property owners in the us with a network of stores located in different states 
we are the largest self storage owner in europe with stores located in seven countries 
we directly own most of these properties but also hold an interest in some of them indirectly through our subsidiaries and joint ventures 
our approach to investment in self storage our objective is to maximize shareholder value through continued improvement in the performance of our existing portfolio and through acquisition and development and investment in additional self storage properties 
historically  we have been long term holders of storage properties that we acquire or develop because we believe these assets have steady long term growth characteristics  low functional obsolescence and cost benefits relating to economies of scale 
however  we will  from time to time  sell properties when we feel market conditions warrant or where a property fails to fit into our strategic plans 
we take a long term view of planning and executing this objective 
over the years  we have developed significant expertise in the acquisition  design  development and management of self storage properties 
we believe these capabilities enhance our investment options by giving us a better sense of local market conditions and opportunities 
relying on these capabilities  we have the flexibility to react to changing market conditions by expanding through the development of new storage properties or by acquiring existing storage properties from competitors 
further  the significant market diversification of our self storage properties adds stability and predictability to our portfolio 
we have observed that changes in people s lives or circumstances are the key driver of demand for short term storage space 
private individuals represent approximately of our customer base 
business customers looking for expansion or transition space make up the balance  although this ratio may vary from storage center to storage center 
our customer base spans a wide range of economic strata and business types 
based on our experience in the business  we have determined that most customers place a high value on convenience through the location of the center and ease of renting  access and moving 
consequently  we have elected to focus our investment activities in densely populated  high quality neighborhoods and offer high quality products and services 
we believe a growing segment of prospective customers are willing to pay higher rates for these benefits 
when we enter a new market  we seek highly visible  easily accessible locations in retail corridors to create customer awareness 
through multiple locations of this kind in a metropolitan area  we seek to establish brand recognition as well as economies of scale in operating our storage centers 
in most markets  our goal is to own at least stores in order to realize these efficiencies 
to further enhance brand recognition  we strive to achieve a uniform look to our properties through the use of signage  color schemes  quality of the buildings and our trademark lighthouse office design in new developments 
our approach to managing the business we believe that the supply and demand characteristics of the self storage industry are defined by neighborhood trade areas that can range in size from one to five miles in radius 
to effectively manage the business at any given location  we must be aware of the local dynamics of demand  pricing and competitor actions within the applicable neighborhood trade area 

table of contents as a result  we approach the management of our business and portfolio on a decentralized basis by maintaining local management and market expertise in all our key markets 
our field personnel constantly monitor market trends in supply  competition  pricing and internal performance  making strategic and tactical adjustments at the storage centers as needed 
key metrics in monitoring the supply of self storage properties include construction starts  sales of doors by suppliers to the industry and inquiry levels at the storage centers 
we monitor competition and pricing by watching our closing rate on inquiries and our volume of discounting for new customers 
centrally  we maintain an in house asset management team that evaluates all investment proposals and monitors progress and performance of each property 
we take a similar approach to the business in europe where we maintain fully integrated investment and management teams made up almost entirely of nationals in each of the countries we invest 
our approach to raising capital ownership in the self storage industry is highly fragmented  with the vast majority of properties owned privately by local and regional operators 
we have chosen to operate as a self managed  publicly traded reit due to the tax benefits and flexibility it provides us for accessing new sources of capital 
as a reit we are required to distribute the majority of our annual cash flow from operations  which provides our investors a regular dividend stream that has grown steadily over time 
we believe our assets are well suited to meet this type of investment objective as they provide a highly stable cash flow 
this dividend strategy means that we must fund growth by raising additional capital on a regular basis 
we maintain a skilled team who regularly monitors the debt and equity markets  both private and public  to obtain the best available capital and minimize our cost of capital 
we anticipate funding our short and long term liquidity needs through a combination of retained operating cash  borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facilities  selling existing stores or excess land that does not fit our long term strategic plan  and or through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities 
a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market conditions  interest rates  short and long term liquidity needs  and the relative cost of debt and equity capital 
covenants and regulatory compliance the indenture governing our approximately million of debt securities requires us to deliver our annual and quarterly filings with the sec to the indenture trustee within days after the date such periodic filings are due  and to deliver a copy of our annual report to the bondholders within days of the end of our fiscal year 
failure to meet these deadlines could cause the indenture trustee to declare us in default of our bond indenture 
the indenture contains a day cure period following our receipt of notice from the trustee of a default 
to date  we have not received notice of a default from the trustee or the bondholders 
with the filing of this annual report on form k and the delivery of copies of this filing to the trustee we believe that we will cure any default of the reporting covenants in the indenture 
the new york stock exchange nyse also requires that its listed companies distribute annual reports to shareholders no later than days after the close of each fiscal year 
on april  we received a letter from the nyse that we would be included in a list of late filers posted on our company and market data pages on the nyse s website 
the late filer designation is a lf added to our trading symbol 
failure to mail the annual report to the shareholders on a timely basis could subject us to potential delisting of our securities on the nyse 
as of the date of filing this annual report on form k we have not received a notice from the nyse that it intends to delist our stock 
we believe that the lf designation will be removed from our trading symbol on the business day following receipt of this report by the nyse 

table of contents current industry trends and outlook supply and demand for the two years following the events of september   we have in general experienced a softening in demand at our us storage centers 
in addition  our new storage centers have been requiring a longer period of time to reach rental stabilization  which is typically considered to be occupancy 
we have historically projected new storage centers will reach their stabilized investment yields within to months of opening 
in the last several years  new storage centers have been taking to months to reach stabilization 
in order to counteract this slow down in the rent up pace  we offered reduced rates to attract new customers 
we believe there are two main factors contributing to the trends during this period the slowdown in the us economy  and the volume of new supply entering our markets 
we believe some areas  such as northern california and puget sound  have been more affected by the downturn in the local economies 
other markets  such as chicago and parts of texas  we believe have seen a significant amount of new supply over the past three years  contributing to weaker operating results 
in our view  the sustained rate at which new supply came in to the markets over the past three years was unusual 
we attribute the continued development  in the face of declining industry fundamentals  to the historically low interest rates available to developers 
reported new construction starts have only noticeably started to decline over the past months 
beginning in  in response to the reduced demand and increased competition  we became more aggressive with our sales training programs and increased our store operating hours 
additionally in  we intensified our store maintenance program 
we believe these efforts began to show results in the third quarter of although customer inquires continued to be down slightly year over year  we experienced an increase in our closing rate 
during the third quarter  our average occupancies stabilized and our average rental rates improved slightly 
during the fourth quarter  customer inquiries continued to be slightly lower compared to the same quarter of the previous year but average rental rates grew by and occupancy by 
our performance in the fourth quarter resulted in slightly improved overall results for when compared to annual results for see segment performance for details 
since  our operations in europe have experienced a similar softening in demand due  we believe  to the general economic conditions in europe 
similar to new storage centers in the us  the periods required for new european storage centers to reach stabilization has increased  now ranging from to months 
some of our european storage centers have also been affected by additional new storage centers that we have developed as we expand to reach targeted economies of scale in various markets 
we believe that these effects  which include lower than expected occupancy and rental rates  are temporary 
consumer awareness of the self storage product is dramatically different in europe as compared to the us in the us  where self storage has existed for over years  the product is well known and accepted by the us consumer 
today  there are a reported  self storage facilities in the us in europe  however  self storage is still relatively new and general consumer awareness is lower 
there are reported to be approximately self storage properties in the european countries where we operate 
as consumer awareness and acceptance grows in europe  we believe that these effects of expansion will begin to decline 
our european same store pool also exhibited some improvement in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of occupancy increased to from and the annual average rental rate increased to per square foot from per square foot 

table of contents as a leader and innovator in the self storage industry  we have actively examined and experimented with new approaches to the business and related products 
while we expect to continue with this approach  we have decided to exit several business lines that do not provide sufficient value to our core self storage business 
at the end of  we made the decision to close our stg containerized storage and shurgard preferred partners business lines 
we ceased operations in both of these activities prior to the end of the first quarter of although we no longer operate a containerized storage business  we still see the strategic need to help our customers with the transportation of their goods and will actively continue to pursue our role as a coordinator of pack  load  and move services  without providing these services directly 
we will also continue to actively operate our rental truck activities 
acquisition and development of real estate historically  we have grown in the us both through development and acquisition  taking advantage of current market conditions to select either alternative 
in europe  most of our growth has been through development of new stores 
we have made limited dispositions of properties in the past 
currently  we believe that low interest rates in the us have contributed to a rise in the price being paid by private investors to acquire existing self storage facilities in the us in this environment  we have focused on acquisitions we consider unique or strategic in nature 
the current environment has also created opportunities to sell some of the assets in our portfolio that no longer meet our long term strategic goals and we may consider some of these opportunities 
our development of new storage centers in the us has slowed in recent years as quality opportunities have become more limited 
in general  we view the us market as mature  with a strong supply of self storage properties 
we believe future development growth opportunities will result primarily from population growth in new markets 
we have placed renewed emphasis on performance and opportunities for improvement within our existing portfolio  in some instances through redevelopment of our older stores 
a recent dramatic rise in steel prices may further affect our ability to develop or redevelop cost effectively 
in europe  where we have a significant market leadership position in an emerging industry  we continue to develop new storage centers at a steady pace due to the availability of quality real estate at attractive prices 
new european countries are considered from time to time as we feel conditions are appropriate 
we believe continued growth in europe will help solidify our position as market leader and improve our economies of scale in marketing and management 
company financial reporting we have experienced the following events relating to our financial reporting over the past year in may  we restated our historical financial statements for the years ended and to reflect the proper accounting for certain interest rate swaps  in november as further described in item  our auditors resigned without completing the interim review of our third quarter financial statements  as a result we were delayed in filing our third quarter form q  in november  we filed our third quarter form q that failed to meet interim financial statements review requirement because of our auditors resignation  in january  we retained a new audit firm to perform an audit of our financial statements and a re audit of our financial statements for and  in january  we appointed a new interim chief financial officer and a new interim chief accounting officer 

table of contents in march  we did not meet the form k filing deadline  and announced that our form k would include restatements of our and annual financial statements  and in may  our new auditors provided the audit committee with a letter identifying a material weakness in our systems of internal controls see item a 
the culmination of these events was the completion of the audit for  and re audits of and and the related audited financial statements that are included in this form k 
although the completed re audits resulted in restatements of our prior financial statements as disclosed in the following section of this overview  the audit process did not result in the discovery of any material new facts or information 
in addition  we have taken steps to address the need for additional personnel  improved internal control structure and stronger accounting systems that have been identified during the auditing process 
implications and impact of restatements we have restated our previously issued financial statements for the years ended december  and  as well as for the quarters ended march  june and september  and and the quarter ended december  for the items described below 
consolidation of domestic joint ventures domestically  we hold interests in properties through joint ventures with a variety of outside investors 
historically  these joint ventures have been included in our financial statements either on a consolidated or an equity basis 
we have determined that certain partially owned us entities historically accounted for using the equity method should have been consolidated since inception of each entity 
this restatement affects entities and ventures in which we maintain ownership interests ranging from to and which hold a total of storage centers 
consolidation of these entities has the effect of showing all of the assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses of these entities in our financial statements rather than showing our net investment and net earnings from these operations 
at december  and  total consolidated assets for these entities and ventures amounted to million and million  respectively  and total liabilities amounted to million and million  respectively 
there was no impact on net income for any period as a result of this restatement 
we had previously announced our intent to consolidate these joint ventures beginning in the quarter ended march  under fin r 
as a result of the restatement  all periods will now be reported on a comparable basis 
valuation of deferred tax assets historically we have incurred tax operating losses in shurgard europe  which includes our european operations  and in our us taxable reit subsidiary trs  which includes the operations of storage to go 
we expect to continue to incur these losses in we have historically recorded in income the anticipated tax benefit of these loss carry forwards in current year earnings 
we have determined that there was insufficient historical evidence of future profitability in both shurgard europe and the trs to justify the recording of these tax benefits 
these restatements result in the company recording a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets on the balance sheet and eliminating approximately  per diluted share and million per diluted share previously recognized as a part of our net income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
notwithstanding the change in accounting treatment  the underlying accumulated tax losses are still available to the company to be utilized in future years to the extent shurgard europe and the trs are able to generate taxable income 

table of contents tax retention operating lease trol in  we entered into a financing structure utilizing a tax retention operating lease trol in order to facilitate the development of new storage properties 
in june we purchased all properties remaining in the trol and fully consolidated the assets and related debt as of june  we have determined that our historical accounting for the trol was incorrect 
we previously recorded the trol assets as operating leases  which required us to record in our financial statements a rental payment for the lease of the trol assets and residual lease guarantee 
the proper accounting treatment requires that we carry the trol properties and related debt on our balance sheet from inception resulting in a restatement in our financial statements beginning in we are also required to reflect the financing costs related to these properties as interest expense in lieu of the rental payments and depreciate the properties 
because the rental payments in and were less than the interest and depreciation expense  net income has been reduced in these periods  by million per diluted share and million per diluted share  respectively 
there will be no further impact of this change in accounting on future financial statements  other than reduced depreciation expense 
other restatement items we also have restated our consolidated financial statements for the effects of the following items we corrected the accounting for certain accrued liabilities to recognize the expenses in the appropriate periods 
these accruals primarily consisted of compensation and related payroll costs  worker s compensation costs and lease accruals 
we corrected for certain items that impacted the computation of depreciation expense and capitalization of overhead and interest 
we reversed amortization of amounts that should have been recognized as a gain in connection with the sale of certain storage centers in prior years 
we corrected the accounting for advertising costs related to print advertisements in telephone books to recognize the expenses when the related telephone book is first published 
we corrected the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for both basic and diluted shares 
weighted average basic shares outstanding decreased from  to  and diluted shares outstanding decreased from  to  the impact of this correction resulted in an increase in net income per common share of for both basic and diluted earnings per share 
summary the aggregate impact of all restatement items including the restatement for preferred stock issuance costs discussed in note c  resulted in a decrease in net income available to common shareholders compared to previously reported amounts of million per diluted share and million per diluted share for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents the effects of the restatement items described above on our net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share are as follows year ended december  year ended december  earnings per share earnings per share basic diluted basic diluted in thousands except per share data as previously reported impact of adjustments for consolidation of domestic joint ventures valuation of deferred tax assets tax retention operating leases period end accruals depreciation expense and capitalization of overhead and interest gain on sale of storage centers advertising costs weighted average shares outstanding other eitf topic d as restated restated for the application of eitf topic d see note c to our consolidated financial statements

table of contents most of our cash flow is generated from our self storage properties see our discussion of same store and new store included in segment performance 
the following chart shows our storage center revenue as a result of the restatement

item selected financial data  results of operations  and note b to our consolidated financial statements further discuss these restatements and their specific impact on our historical financial statements 
consolidated statements of income our discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
net income net income was million for  a decrease of million  or compared to the results for due to decreased income from storage center operations  as well as an increase in the interest expense on loans related to our development activity 
the decline in income from storage center operations is the result of an increase in impairment of long lived assets  and general  administrative and other 
the increase from million in to million in is primarily due to an increase in income from storage center operations and a decrease in the amortization of participation rights discount and interest on loans 
storage center operations revenue storage center operations revenue was million for  an increase of million  or compared to the results for as a result of factors discussed under segment performance 
other revenue other revenue increased from million in to million in primarily due to the increased revenue from our tenant insurance referral program

direct and indirect operating expenses of million  million and million for our containerized storage operations are also included in operating expenses for  and  respectively 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million for  compared to million for and million for the increase is due to an increased number of stores included in our consolidated financial statements over the same period of time 
beginning january   we ceased amortization of goodwill see note o to our consolidated financial statements 
impairment expenses we recorded impairment expenses of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
in  we recorded a million impairment expense related to certain real estate assets  of this amount million relates to four properties associated with our joint venture ccp shurgard see note i to our consolidated financial statements 
additionally in we recognized a million impairment expense related to our decision to exit the containerized storage business and a million write down of a note receivable 
the million impairment expense we recorded in relates primarily to the cost associated with closing the operations of certain warehouses of stg see note m to our consolidated financial statements 
general  administrative and other expenses general and administrative expenses were million for  an increase of million  or compared to this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in accounting and professional fees and a million increase in compensation expense related to newly created positions 
the decrease in general and administrative expense of million from to is primarily the result of accruing million in related to exit costs associated with the closure of certain warehouses of stg see note m to our consolidated financial statements 
interest income and other  net interest income and other decreased from million in to million in this is primarily attributable to recording a one time lease termination settlement of million in interest expense interest expense consists of two components interest on loans and amortization of participation rights discount 
interest expense on the lines of credit and notes payable decreased from to and increased from to due to variances in the outstanding balances 
the increase in relates primarily to an increase in mortgage notes payable related to the purchase of of morningstar in june and to additional senior notes payable of million that were issued in march additionally  we capitalized interest related to the construction of domestic storage centers of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we reduced the participation rights liability by million  which resulted in a corresponding reduction of interest expense see note i to our consolidated financial statements 
in  we reduced the participation rights liability associated with ccp shurgard by million which resulted in decreased amortization for the second half of interest expense also included amortization of loan costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
unrealized loss on financial instruments during  we entered into three interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations related to the company s various options at the end of its trol transaction 
since these transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 we recorded million  million and million in unrealized loss for these financial instruments for the years ended december   and  respectively 
minority interest minority interest increased from  in to  in and to million in  which relates to the growing operations of our consolidated subsidiaries and the inclusion of the non controlled interest in morningstar for the first full year in  as discussed previously 
income tax expense income tax expense consists of a current tax expense on a consolidated belgian subsidiary  recom co  snc recom  that we started consolidating in june we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets for the years ended december   and

we also purchased million of recom bonds and started consolidating recom in june although we own of shurgard europe as of december   the results of european operations are not consolidated in our financial statements 
our interest in shurgard europe is accounted for under the equity method of accounting because our remaining partner maintains substantive and important approval rights relating to certain significant operating decisions see off balance sheet transactions 
we recorded losses from european operations of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
shurgard europe s properties generated million in net operating income noi after leasehold expense in compared to million in and million in participating mortgages as of december   we had million invested in a participating mortgage loan for which we recorded million of equity in earnings

in december  we made the decision that we would exit the containerized storage business and we had ceased to use the warehouses as of the end of the first quarter segment performance we evaluate performance of our real estate assets in two segments 
the first segment  same store  represents those storage centers and business parks that are not in the rent up stage and for which historical information is available 
the second segment  new store  represents those storage centers recently acquired or developed for which performance is measured primarily based on original investment expectations 
we evaluate all stores on the same basis regardless of ownership interest in the property 
we believe net operating income noi is a meaningful disclosure of operating performance as a supplement to net income because we rely on noi for purposes of making decisions with respect to resource allocations  current property values  segment performance  and comparing period to period and market to market property operating results 
noi is defined as storage center operations revenues less direct operating and real estate tax expense for each of our properties 
for a reconciliation of same store and new store noi to net income see note v to our consolidated financial statements 
the following sections discuss the performance of these segments for domestic properties 
domestic same stores our definition of same store includes domestic existing stores acquired prior to january of the previous year as well as domestic developed properties that have been operating for a full two years as of january of the current year 
our definition of same store results in the addition of stores each year as new acquisitions and developments meet the criteria for inclusion  so we then include these stores in the previous year s comparable data 
other storage companies may define same store differently  which will affect the comparability of the data

does not include containerized storage operations  internal real estate acquisition cost or abandoned development expense 
indirect operating expense is allocated to stores based on number of months in operation during the period 
a during  same store revenue increased over in  we started to experience erosion in occupancy and in rental rates that we attributed to general economic conditions and to the rate reductions being offered by competitors 
in response to these conditions  we provided additional training to our direct sales team and store management personnel  and we re aligned our sales center to improve our closing ratios on inquiries made by customers 
we believe these initiatives  together with an improvement in the general economic conditions starting in the fourth quarter of  resulted in an increase in our average occupancy without having to further adjust our rates downward 
additionally  increases in retail sales contributed approximately  in revenue increases from to  which reflect improvements in the management of our inventory and the portfolio of retail products offered 
also the increases in late fees contributed to approximately  increase in revenue 
b personnel expenses increased due to sunday openings and incentive based wage increases for store employees 
c repair and maintenance costs increased significantly in over due to higher than normal snow removal costs experienced by our properties in the northeastern region of the us additionally  we created a centralized maintenance program that enabled us to accelerate our repair activities for our older us properties 
d noi has risen from to primarily due to increases in storage center operations revenue  which is a function of changes in rental rates and occupancy 
while the storage business is seasonal  with spring and summer being peak occupancy periods  the year over year trends from to  we believe  are representative of general market changes 
revenue increases from to resulted primarily from occupancy increases in stores that became same store in and were offset by a slight decrease in the rental rate

number of same store properties are as of december  a during  we experienced a decrease in demand evidenced by a decrease in recorded inquiries at the stores 
occupancies dropped two and a half percentage points from january through april 
in order to stop this erosion we began to make rate concessions 
although the average rate for the year increased  quarterly trends showed that this increase was the result of a increase in the first quarter  followed by a slow erosion of rates from may through december 
despite these rate adjustments  our seasonal occupancy increase that normally occurs over late spring and summer was not as significant as most years and we continued to lag occupancy levels 
in response to decreasing demand and increasing competition  we reviewed our marketing and sales programs to identify areas for potential improvement 
during the spring and summer of  we refocused our national sales center  and during  we realigned our direct sales team to achieve lower overhead and retain the highest performing representatives 
as a result of this  as well as additional training of store management personnel  abandonment ratios by our sales and customer service representatives dropped significantly during and closing ratios increased 

table of contents b noi rose from to due to increases in revenue  which is a function of changes in rental rates and occupancy 
while the storage business is seasonal  spring and summer being peak occupancy periods  the year over year trends from to reflected general market changes 
revenue increases from to resulted from rate increases and were offset by occupancy decreases 
c decreased indirect operating expenses resulted in an increase in noi after indirect costs of for compared to indirect operating expenses decreased for primarily due to a reduction in corporate marketing initiatives  and the result of economies of scale achieved by spreading certain fixed costs over a greater number of stores  and the fact that more indirect expenses were allocated to new stores

acquisitions we continue to seek acquisition opportunities for high quality storage centers that meet our investment standards 
we typically target our acquisitions to generate an unleveraged annual yield of to once they have reached stabilization 
we have limited our efforts to pursue only those storage centers that enhance our existing network of stores or allow us to establish significant market presence in new markets ie establish greater market presence or expand an established market to create greater economies of scale 
the operating results of our acquisitions are discussed below 
we can give no assurance that the yield projections noted above regarding the acquisitions will occur 
actual occupancy levels  rates and revenue could be lower if we experience competition from other self storage properties and other storage alternatives in close proximity to our storage centers or general economic conditions

development financing joint ventures in order to expand our development capacity and broaden our access to capital  we have pursued alternative financing options 
in connection with this initiative  we formed a joint venture  ccp shurgard venture  llc ccp shurgard  in december with an affiliate of jp morgan partners 
under this joint venture agreement  we constructed storage centers financed through the use of cash flows provided by operations and our line of credit and  on completion  contributed those storage centers to the joint venture 
at the time of contribution  we were reimbursed to the extent that our historical cost plus negative cash flow prior to the transfer exceeded our pro rata portion of required equity calculated as total required funding less amounts provided from financial institutions multiplied by our ownership percentage

in september  ccpre storage  llc exercised its right to have the joint venture put to us five properties 
in march we gave notice of our intention to acquire one of the properties subject to the put for million and declined to purchase the remaining four properties at the put price 
the properties that we did not agree to purchase under the put may be sold on the open market at the discretion of our joint venture partner 
the decision not to purchase these four properties resulted in a million reduction of our net participation rights liability at december   representing the accrued participation liability recorded for these properties through september   and a corresponding increase in interest income and other  net was recorded in amortization of participation rights discounts

those joint ventures are managed by two separate groups with whom we have established affiliation relationships to develop and manage jointly owned storage centers

sct was a trust that took title to development properties identified by us  constructed them to our specifications and then leased them to us 
under the agreements  we functioned as construction agent and tenant 
we had the option to acquire the properties at or before the end of the lease

european operations european business summary european operations are conducted in belgium  sweden  france  the netherlands  the united kingdom  denmark and germany through shurgard self storage  sca shurgard europe 
in  in a series of transactions we increased our direct and indirect ownership interest in shurgard europe from to 
our interest in shurgard europe is accounted for under the equity method of accounting  because our remaining partner maintains substantive and important approval rights relating to certain 
table of contents significant operating decisions 
the data included in the following discussion and tables reflect total european operations  not our pro rata percentage 
shurgard europe  which has tested the self storage product on european consumers since  is now the largest owner and operator of self storage facilities in europe 
european consumers tend to live in more crowded population densities and smaller living spaces than us consumers which makes self storage an attractive option 
the self storage industry is not well established in much of europe  and we believe this presents shurgard europe with a significant growth opportunity for the foreseeable future 
although we are seeing other industry players entering the european markets  we believe that the supply being added to the market still leaves significant opportunity when compared to the overall size of the market 
shurgard europe and its subsidiaries have established expansion plans that focus now in five regional markets the benelux region which includes belgium and the netherlands  france  scandinavia including sweden and denmark  the uk  and more recently germany 
in order to take advantage of these market opportunities  shurgard europe continues to expand in those countries 
although revenue is growing as the increasing portfolio of stores are continuing to rent up  we anticipate this expansion will continue to produce losses for the next two to three years as financing costs  start up losses from the additional stores and overhead cost necessary to carry out the expansion plans will continue to exceed operating income 
as further new development activity is currently being carried out through a joint venture agreement  as described below  these losses should be offset by the revenue growth from shurgard europe s own portfolio 
in january  shurgard europe entered into an agreement with crescent to create a new joint venture entity  first shurgard  to develop approximately storage facilities in western europe 
shurgard europe has a interest in this venture 
as part of the first shurgard joint venture agreement  shurgard europe receives development fees equal to of the cost of newly developed storage centers  together with reimbursement of certain out of pocket costs of  per storage center and certain financing fees 
in addition  first shurgard and shurgard europe have entered into a year management agreement under which shurgard europe receives management fees equal to of revenues  but not less than  per year for each storage center in operation for the first two years 
the first shurgard joint venture arrangement also provides that  in addition to its initial ownership interest  shurgard europe will receive an additional of first shurgard s terminal value in providing that each of shurgard europe and crescent has received an internal rate of return of on its equity investment 
first shurgard will own the developed storage centers property

table of contents a we attributed the drop in performance in sweden to the drop in the general swedish economy impacting demand  the opening of several of our new stores in the stockholm market temporarily diluting demand at our older stores and underperformance of our management team in the early part of we believe the actions  we have taken to address these issues  including a focus on training store personnel and increased local marketing activities are starting to generate positive results
