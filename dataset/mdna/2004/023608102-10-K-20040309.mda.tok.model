item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview executive summary as we began  ameren was faced with a weak economy and energy market  electric rate reductions in our missouri service territory and rising employee benefit costs 
to tackle these challenges  we initiated a voluntary retirement program that reduced staffing levels by over people  closed inefficient generating units  took steps to reduce employee benefit costs and focused on cost containment throughout our business 
while decisions to undertake these initiatives were difficult  management felt they were necessary to meet investors expectations and better position ameren for the future so as to benefit all of our stakeholders 
strong operating performance at our power plants during permitted ameren to offset reduced sales due to milder than normal summer weather and to take advantage of better than expected interchange power prices 
in  our plants produced more electricity in a single year than ever before  resulting in an increased contribution from interchange sales 
in  we also successfully completed the acquisition and integration of cilcorp  realizing anticipated synergies 
with the addition of cilcorp  ameren now serves over million electric and over  natural gas customers in missouri and illinois 
we are the largest electric utility in missouri and the second largest electric utility in illinois 
in february  we signed a definitive agreement to purchase from dynegy the stock of illinois power and an additional interest in eei 
we believe illinois power is an excellent strategic fit with our core transmission and distribution business and the additional interest in eei will bring us more value from eei s low cost generation plant 
the acquisition of illinois power will add approximately  electric customers and  gas customers 
subject to regulatory approval  we expect to complete the acquisition by the end of we expect factors positively impacting earnings to include  among other things  sales growth in our service territory  almost million in gas rate increases for our gas operations  incremental synergies from the cilcorp acquisition and continued cost control 
factors negatively impacting earnings are expected to be the implementation of a million reduction in annual electric revenues in missouri in april  a callaway nuclear plant refueling outage in the spring of  and rising employee benefit costs 
our earnings will also be affected by the short term dilutive effect of the issuance of common shares in february  the proceeds of which are intended to be ultimately used for the acquisitions of illinois power and the interest in eei 
however  once completed  we expect these acquisitions to increase our earnings per share

acquisitions cilcorp and medina valley on january   ameren completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of cilcorp from aes 
cilcorp is the parent company of peoria  illinois based cilco 
with the acquisition  cilco became an indirect ameren subsidiary  but remains a separate utility company  operating as amerencilco 
on february   ameren also completed the acquisition of medina valley  which indirectly owns a megawatt  gas fired electric generation plant 
the results of operations for cilcorp and medina valley were included in ameren s consolidated financial statements effective with the respective january and february acquisition dates 
ameren acquired cilcorp to complement its existing illinois gas and electric operations 
the purchase included cilco s rate regulated electric and natural gas businesses in illinois serving approximately  and  customers  respectively  of which approximately  are combination electric and gas customers 
cilco s service territory is contiguous to cips service territory 
cilco also has a non rate regulated electric and gas marketing business principally focused in the chicago  illinois region 
finally  the purchase included approximately  megawatts of largely coal fired generating capacity  most of which became non rate regulated on october   due to cilco s transfer of approximately  megawatts of generating capacity to aerg 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to our financial statements under part ii  item of this report for further information on the transfer to aerg 
the total acquisition cost was approximately billion and included the assumption by ameren of cilcorp and medina valley debt and preferred stock at closing of million and consideration of million in cash  net of million cash acquired 
the cash component of the purchase price came from ameren s issuance in september of million common shares and its issuance in early of an additional million common shares  which together generated aggregate net proceeds of million 
see note acquisitions to our financial statements under part ii  item of this report for further information 
illinois power on february   we entered into an agreement with dynegy to purchase the stock of decatur  illinois based illinois power and dynegy s ownership interest in eei 
illinois power operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business serving approximately  electric and  gas customers in areas contiguous to our existing illinois utility service territories 
the total transaction value is approximately billion  including the assumption of approximately billion of illinois power debt and preferred stock  with the balance of the purchase price to be paid in cash at closing 
ameren will place million of the cash portion of the purchase price in a six year escrow pending resolution of certain contingent environmental obligations of illinois power and other dynegy affiliates for which ameren has been provided indemnification by dynegy 
ameren s financing plan for this transaction includes the issuance of new ameren common stock  which in total  is expected to equal at least of the transaction value 
in february  ameren issued million common shares that generated net proceeds of million 
proceeds from this sale and future offerings are expected to be used to finance the cash portion of the purchase price  to reduce illinois power debt assumed as part of this transaction  to pay any related premiums and possibly to reduce present or future indebtedness and or repurchase securities of ameren or our subsidiaries 
upon completion of the acquisition  expected by the end of  illinois power will become an ameren subsidiary operating as amerenip 
the transaction is subject to the approval of the icc  the sec  the ferc  the federal communications commission  the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act and other customary closing conditions 
in addition  this transaction includes a firm capacity power supply contract for illinois power s annual purchase of  megawatts of electricity from a subsidiary of dynegy 
this contract will extend through and is expected to supply about of illinois power s customer requirements 
for the nine months ended september   illinois power had revenues of billion  operating income of million  and net income applicable to its common shareholder of million  and at september   had total assets of billion  excluding an intercompany note receivable from its parent company of approximately billion 
for the year ended december   illinois power had revenues of billion  operating income of million  and net income applicable to its common shareholder of million  and at december   had total assets of billion  excluding an intercompany note receivable from its parent company of approximately billion

results of operations earnings summary our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors 
weather  economic conditions and the actions of key customers or competitors can significantly impact the demand for our services 
our results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations caused by winter heating and summer cooling demand 
with approximately of ameren s revenues directly subject to regulation by various state and federal agencies  decisions by regulators can have a material impact on the price we charge for our services 
our non rate regulated sales are subject to market conditions for power 
we principally utilize coal  nuclear fuel  natural gas and oil in our operations 
the prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the world economic and political environment  weather  supply and demand levels and many other factors 
we do not have fuel or purchased power cost recovery mechanisms in missouri or illinois for our electric utility businesses  but we do have gas cost recovery mechanisms in each state for our gas utility businesses 
the electric rates for ue  cips and cilco are largely set through such that cost decreases or increases will not be immediately reflected in rates 
in addition  the gas delivery rates for ue in missouri are set through june fluctuations in interest rates impact our cost of borrowing and pension and postretirement benefits 
we employ various risk management strategies in order to try to reduce our exposure to commodity risks and other risks inherent in our business 
the reliability of our power plants  and transmission and distribution systems  and the level of operating and administrative costs  and capital investment are key factors that we seek to control in order to optimize our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
ameren s net income for  and  was million per share before dilution  million per share before dilution  and million per share before dilution  respectively

cash flows from operating activities versus cash flows provided by operating activities increased for ameren and genco and decreased for ue  cips  cilcorp and cilco in as compared to the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for ameren and genco was primarily a result of increased net earnings discussed above under results of operations 
the increase at ameren was reduced by two non cash components of net earnings  one associated with the gain of million related to the adoption of sfas no 
and the other the million pre tax gain related to ue s settlement of the coal mine reclamation issues  of which only million was received in cash during partially offsetting these benefits to cash flows from operating activities were increased materials and supplies inventories resulting from increased natural gas volumes being put into storage  principally due to the acquisition of cilcorp  recorded at ameren  and higher gas prices 
cash provided by operating activities decreased for ue  cips  cilcorp and cilco in compared to primarily due to increased working capital requirements and timing differences 
ue s decrease in cash flows from operating activities was attributable to increased tax payments and gas inventory increases  partially offset by lower operations and maintenance expenses and the million pre tax gain related to ue s settlement of the coal mine reclamation issues  of which million was received in cash during cips decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to increased tax payments in compared to versus cash flows provided by operating activities increased for ameren and ue and decreased for cips  genco  cilcorp and cilco for as compared to the increase in cash flows from operating activities for ameren and ue was primarily due to higher cash earnings resulting from favorable weather conditions 
in addition  ameren s cash flows from operations benefited from sales of emission credits 
the increase at ameren and ue was partially offset by payments of customer sharing credits under ue s now expired missouri electric alternative regulation plan million and the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued taxes 
also offseting ameren s increase in cash flows from operations were discretionary pension plan contributions of million in the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities for cips and genco was primarily attributable to the timing of payments on accounts payable and changes in working capital 
cips decrease in cash flows from operations was also caused by lower contributions in aid of construction and increased pension funding costs 
the timing of payment of funds between genco and its affiliates contributed to genco s decrease in cash flows 
cilcorp s and cilco s decreases in cash flows from operations were primarily due to changes in working capital requirements offset by increased non rate regulated sales to electric customers in illinois outside cilco s service territory 
pension funding ameren made cash contributions totaling million in and million in to our defined benefit retirement plan qualified trusts 
a minimum pension liability was recorded at december   which resulted in an after tax charge to oci and a reduction in stockholders equity for ameren of million

as discussed above  we made cash contributions in and to our defined benefit retirement plan qualified trusts 
based on our assumptions at december   we expect to be required under erisa to fund an average of approximately million annually from through in order to maintain minimum funding levels for our pension plans

also included in the estimate is the addition of new cts at ue with approximately megawatts of capacity at ue s venice  illinois location by the end of total costs expected to be incurred for these units approximate million  of which approximately million was committed as of december  ue committed to make between billion to billion of infrastructure investments during the period of january  to june   as part of ue s missouri electric rate case settlement 
in addition  commitments totaling at least million for gas infrastructure improvements between july  and june  were agreed upon in relation to ue s missouri gas rate case settlement 
both federal and state laws require significant reductions in so and nox emissions that result from burning fossil fuels 
the clean air act creates a marketable commodity called an so allowance 
each allowance gives the owner the right to emit one ton of so all existing generating facilities have been allocated allowances based on past production and the statutory emission reduction goals 
if additional allowances are needed for new generating facilities  they can be purchased from facilities having excess allowances or from so allowance banks 
our generating facilities comply with the so allowance caps through the purchase of allowances  the use of low sulfur fuels or through the application of pollution control technology 
the epa issued a rule in october requiring eastern states and the district of columbia to reduce emissions of nox in order to reduce ozone in the eastern united states 
among other things  the epa s rule establishes an ozone season  which runs from may through september  and a nox emission budget for each state  including illinois 
the epa rule requires states to implement controls sufficient to meet their nox budget by may  in february  the epa proposed similar rules for missouri 
these are expected to be issued as final rules in the spring of the compliance date for the missouri rules is expected to be may  as a result of these requirements  ameren generating companies have installed a variety of nox control technologies on their power plant boilers over the past several years 
the following table presents estimated remaining capital expenditures to comply with the final nox regulations in missouri and illinois between and ameren million to million ue million to million cips genco million to million cilcorp cilco these estimates include the assumption that the regulations will require the installation of selective catalytic reduction technology on some of our units  as well as additional controls 
in  we are seeking regulatory approval to transfer at net book value approximately megawatts approximately million of generating capacity from genco to ue  to satisfy the requirements of ue s missouri electric rate case settlement and to meet future ue generating capacity needs 
see note rate and regulatory matters to our financial statements under part ii  item of this report for further information 
this transfer is not included in our estimated capital expenditures listed in the table above 
cips and cilco s estimates include capital expenditures for transmission and distribution related activities 
genco s estimate includes capital expenditures for upgrades to existing coal and gas fired facilities and other generation related activities 
cilco s estimate also includes capital expenditures for generation related activities  as well as for compliance with new nox control regulations at aerg s generating facilities 
we continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs and  as a result  we could modify our plan for generation capacity  which could include the timing of when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio  the type of generation asset technology that will be employed  or whether capacity may be purchased  among other things 
any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred  which could be material 
potential future environmental capital expenditure requirements the following environmental matters are currently pending  but have not been included in our estimated capital expenditures for the period of to new source review on december   the epa published in the federal register revisions to the nsr programs under the clean air act  governing pollution control requirements for new fossil fueled generating plants and major modifications to existing plants 
on october   the epa published a set of associated rules governing the routine maintenance  repair and replacement of equipment at power plants 
various northeastern states  the state of illinois and others  have filed a petition with the united states district court for the district of columbia challenging the legality of the revisions to these nsr programs 
other states  various industries and environmental groups have filed to intervene in this challenge 
at this time  we are unable to predict the impact if this challenge is successful on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
interstate air quality and mercury rules in mid december  the epa issued proposed regulations with respect to so and nox emissions the interstate air quality rule and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants 
these new rules  if adopted  will require significant additional reductions in these emissions from our power plants in phases  beginning in the rules are currently under a public review and comment period  and may change before being issued in or the following table presents preliminary estimates of capital costs based on current technology on the ameren systems to comply with the so and nox rules  as proposed 
ameren million to million million to million ue million to million million to million cips genco million to million million to million cilcorp a million to million million to million cilco million to million million to million a cilcorp consolidates cilco and therefore includes cilco amounts in its balances 
the proposed mercury regulations contain a number of options and the final control requirements are highly uncertain 
ameren estimates additional capital costs to comply with the mercury rules to be up to million by  with ue incurring approximately two thirds of the costs and genco incurring most of the remaining costs 
depending upon the final mercury rules  similar additional costs would be incurred between and multi pollutant legislation the united states congress has been working on legislation to consolidate the numerous air pollution regulations facing the utility industry 
continued deliberation on this multi pollutant legislation is expected in the cost to comply with such legislation  if enacted  is expected to be covered by the modifications to our facilities required by combined interstate air quality and mercury rules described above

outlook we expect the following industry wide trends and company specific issues to impact earnings in and beyond o economic conditions  which principally impact native load demand  particularly from our industrial customers  have been weak for the past few years  but improved in o ameren  ue and cips have historically achieved weather adjusted growth in their native electric residential and commercial load of approximately per year and expect this trend to continue for at least the next few years 
o electric rates in ue s  cips and cilco s illinois service territories are legislatively fixed through january  an electric rate case settlement in ue s missouri service territory has resulted in reductions of million on april   and million on april   with an additional million reduction required for april  in addition  electric rates in missouri cannot change prior to july   subject to certain exclusions outlined in ue s rate settlement 
o power prices in the midwest impact the amount of revenues ue  genco and aerg can generate by marketing any excess power into the interchange markets 
power prices in the midwest also impact the cost of power we purchase in the interchange markets 
long term power prices continue to be generally soft in the midwest  despite a significant increase in power prices in relative to due in part to higher prices for natural gas 
o increased expenses associated with rising employee benefit costs and higher insurance and security costs associated with additional measures ue has taken  or may have to take  at its callaway nuclear plant and other operating plants related to world events 
o ue s callaway nuclear plant will have a refueling outage in the spring of  which is expected to last days  and will increase maintenance and purchased power costs  and reduce the amount of excess power available for sale 
refueling outages occur approximately every months and have historically reduced net earnings at ameren and ue by to million in the year when they occurred 
ue s fall refueling outage is expected to last days due to the installation of new steam generator units during the refueling 
o in january  the mopsc approved a settlement authorizing an annual gas delivery rate increase of approximately million  which went into effect on february  the settlement provides that gas delivery rates cannot change prior to july   subject to certain exclusions

see note rate and regulatory matters to our financial statements under part ii  item of this report for additional information 
o ameren  cilcorp and cilco expect to realize further cilcorp integration synergies associated with reduced overhead expenses and lower fuel costs 
o in february  we sold million shares of new ameren common stock 
proceeds from this sale and future offerings are expected to ultimately be used to finance the cash portion of the purchase price of illinois power and to reduce illinois power debt assumed as part of this transaction and pay any related premiums 
however  prior to the closing of the acquisition of illinois power  we expect the new common shares to be dilutive to earnings per share 
in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate strategies to enhance our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
these strategies may include potential acquisitions  divestitures  and opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues  and other strategic initiatives in order to increase ameren s shareholder value

accounting matters critical accounting policies preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance  as well as the use of estimates 
our application of these policies involves judgments regarding many factors  which  in and of themselves  could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures 
in the table below  we have outlined the critical accounting policies that we believe are most difficult  subjective or complex 
a future change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters  among others  could have a material impact on future financial results 
accounting policy uncertainties affecting application regulatory mechanisms and cost recovery all the ameren companies  except genco  o regulatory environment  external regulatory decisions defer costs as regulatory assets and requirements in accordance with sfas no 
 o anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact accounting for the effects of certain o impact of deregulation and competition on ratemaking types of regulation  and make process and ability to recover costs investments that it is assumed will be collected in future rates 
basis for judgment we determine that costs are recoverable based on previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable 
accounting policy uncertainties affecting application environmental costs we accrue for all known environmental o extent of contamination contamination where remediation can be o responsible party determination reasonably estimated  but some of our o approved methods for cleanup operations have existed for over years o present and future legislation and governmental and previous contamination may be regulations and standards unknown to us 
o results of ongoing research and development regarding environmental impacts basis for judgment we determine the proper amounts to accrue for known environmental contamination based on internal and third party estimates of clean up costs in the context of current remediation standards and available technology 
unbilled revenue at the end of each period  we estimate  o projecting customer energy usage based on expected usage  the amount of o estimating impacts of weather and other usage affecting revenue to record for services that have factors for the unbilled period been provided to customers  but not billed 
basis for judgment we determine the proper amount of unbilled revenue to accrue each period based on the volume of energy delivered as valued by a model of billing cycles and historical usage rates and growth by customer class for our service area  as adjusted for the modeled impact of seasonal and weather variations based on historical results 
valuation of goodwill  long lived assets and asset retirement obligations we assess the carrying value of our o management s identification of impairment indicators goodwill and long lived assets to determine o changes in business  industry  technology or economic whether they are impaired 
we also review and market conditions for the existence of asset retirement o valuation assumptions and conclusions obligations 
if an asset retirement o estimated useful lives of our significant long lived obligation is identified  we determine the assets fair value of the obligation and o actions or assessments by our regulators subsequently reassess and adjust the o identification of an asset retirement obligation obligation  as necessary 
see note summary of significant accounting policies 
basis for judgment annually or whenever events indicate a valuation may have changed  we utilize internal models and third parties to determine fair values 
we use various methods to determine valuations  including earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiples and discounted  undiscounted and probabilistic discounted cash flow models with multiple scenarios 
the identification of asset retirement obligations is conducted through the review of legal documents and interviews 
accounting policy uncertainties affecting application benefit plan accounting based on actuarial calculations  we accrue o future rate of return on pension and other plan assets costs of providing future employee benefits o interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations in accordance with sfas nos 
 and o healthcare cost trend rates  which provide guidance on benefit o timing of employee retirements plan accounting 
see note retirement benefits to our financial statements under part ii  item of this report 
basis for judgment we utilize a third party consultant to assist us in evaluating and recording the proper amount for future employee benefits

effects of inflation and changing prices our rates for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the mopsc and the icc 
non retail electric rates are regulated by the ferc 
our missouri electric and gas rates have been set through june   as part of the settlement of our missouri electric and gas rate cases and our illinois electric rates are legislatively fixed through january  inflation affects our operations  earnings  stockholders equity and financial performance 
the current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost 
under existing regulatory practice  only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers 
as a result  cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace plant in future years 
ameren s generation portion of its business in its illinois jurisdiction is principally non rate regulated and therefore does not have regulated recovery mechanisms 
in our retail electric utility jurisdictions  there are no provisions for adjusting rates to accommodate for changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation 
in our retail gas utility jurisdictions  changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through pga clauses 
we are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent we must purchase natural gas to run our cts 
we have structured various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins to minimize the impact to the financial statements 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk for further information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates 
the following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we handle market risks in accordance with established policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include business  legal and operational risks and are not represented in the following discussion 
our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets within prudent risk parameters 
our risk management policies are set by a risk management steering committee  which is comprised of senior level ameren officers 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with o long term and short term variable rate debt  o fixed rate debt  o commercial paper  o auction rate long term debt  and o auction rate preferred stock 
we manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we hold within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the estimated increase decrease in our annual interest expense and net income if interest rates were to change by on variable rate debt outstanding at december  interest expense net income a ameren ue cips genco cilcorp cilco a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
the model does not consider the effects of the reduced level of potential overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted 
nymex traded futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the nymex and have nominal credit risk 
on all other transactions  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction 
our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables  executory contracts with market risk exposures and leverage lease investments 
the risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups comprising our customer base 
no non affiliated customer represents greater than  in the aggregate  of our accounts receivable 
our revenues are primarily derived from sales of electricity and natural gas to customers in missouri and illinois 
ue and genco have credit exposure associated with accounts receivables from non affiliated companies for interchange sales 
at december   ue s  genco s and marketing company s combined credit exposure to non investment grade counterparties related to interchange sales was million  net of collateral 
we establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program which involves daily exposure reporting to senior management  master trading and netting agreements  and credit support such as letters of credit and parental guarantees 
we also analyze each counterparty s financial condition prior to entering into sales  forwards  swaps  futures or option contracts and monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged leases 
equity price risk our costs of providing non contributory defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors  such as the rate of return on plan assets  discount rate  the rate of increase in healthcare costs and contributions made to the plans 
the market value of our plan assets was affected by declines in the equity market for through for the pension and postretirement plans 
as a result  at december   we recognized an additional minimum pension liability as prescribed by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which resulted in an after tax charge to oci and a reduction in stockholders equity of million 
at december   the minimum pension liability was reduced  resulting in oci of million and an increase in stockholders equity 
the following table presents the minimum pension liability amounts  after taxes  for the ameren companies as of december  and ameren a ue cips genco cilcorp b cilco a excludes amounts for cilcorp and cilco prior to the acquisition date of january   includes amounts for non registrant ameren subsidiaries 
b amounts represent predecessor information 
cilcorp consolidates cilco and therefore includes cilco amounts in its balances 
the amount of the pension liability as of december   was the result of asset returns  interest rates and our contributions to the plans during in future years  the liability recorded  the costs reflected in net income  or oci  or cash contributions to the plans could increase materially without a recovery in equity markets in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 
if the fair value of the plan assets were to grow and exceed the accumulated benefit obligations in the future  then the recorded liability would be reduced and a corresponding amount of equity would be restored  net of taxes 
ue also maintains trust funds  as required by the nrc and missouri and illinois state laws  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities  debt securities  and cash and cash equivalents and totaled million at fair value 
by maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments  ue seeks to maximize the returns to be utilized to fund nuclear decommissioning costs 
however  the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
ue actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining  and periodically reviewing  established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trusts to various investment options 
ue s exposure to equity price market risk is  in large part  mitigated  due to the fact that ue is currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in its rates 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas  fuel and electricity to the extent they cannot be recovered through rates 
ue has electric rate freezes in place in missouri through june   and ue  cips and cilco have electric rate freezes in place in illinois through january  we utilize several techniques to mitigate risk  including utilizing derivative financial instruments 
a derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on  or derived from  the value of some underlying asset 
the derivative financial instruments that we use primarily forward contracts  futures contracts  option contracts and financial swap contracts are dictated by risk management policies 
with regard to ue  cips and cilco s natural gas utility business  exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact there are gas cost recovery mechanisms pga clauses in place in both missouri and illinois 
these gas cost recovery mechanisms allow ue  cips and cilco to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred costs of natural gas 
we use fixed price forward contracts  as well as futures  options and financial swaps to manage risks associated with fuel and natural gas prices 
the majority of our fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts 
since we do not have a provision similar to the pga clause for our electric operations  we have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal and nuclear fuel in order to manage our exposure to fuel prices 
see note commitments and contingencies to our financial statements under part ii  item of this report for further information 
with regard to our electric generating operations  ue  genco and cilco are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent they must purchase natural gas to run cts 
their natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas to intermediate and peaking units by optimizing transportation and storage options and minimizing cost and price risk by structuring various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins 
the following table presents the percentages of the required supply of coal for our coal fired power plants  nuclear fuel and natural gas for our cts and distribution  as appropriate that are price hedged over the five year period from through ameren coal nuclear fuel natural gas for generation natural gas for distribution ue coal nuclear fuel natural gas for generation natural gas for distribution cips natural gas for distribution genco coal natural gas for generation cilcorp a coal natural gas for distribution cilco coal natural gas for distribution a cilcorp consolidates cilco and therefore includes cilco amounts in its balances 
the following table presents the estimated increase or decrease in our total fuel expense and net income if coal costs were to change by on any requirements currently not covered by fixed price contracts for the five year period through fuel expense net income a ameren ue cips genco cilcorp b cilco a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
b cilcorp consolidates cilco and therefore includes cilco amounts in its balances 
in the event of a significant change in coal prices  we would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources 
see supply for electric power under part i  item of this report for the percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal  nuclear  natural gas  hydro and oil 
with regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel  ue has fixed priced and base price with escalation agreements and or inventories to fulfill its callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium  conversion  enrichment  and fabrication services through ue expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected remainder of the life of the plant  at prices which cannot now be accurately predicted 
ue s strategy is to hedge some of its three year requirements 
this strategy permits optimum timing of new forward contracts given the relatively long price cycles in the nuclear fuel markets and provides security of supply to protect against unforeseen market disruptions 
unlike electricity and natural gas markets  there are no sophisticated financial instruments in nuclear fuel markets so most hedging is done via inventories and forward contracts 
although we cannot completely eliminate the effects of gas price volatility  our strategy is designed to minimize the effect of market conditions on our results of operations 
our gas procurement strategy includes procuring natural gas under a portfolio of agreements with price structures  including fixed price  indexed price and embedded price hedges such as caps and collars 
our strategy also utilizes physical assets through storage  operator and balancing agreements to minimize price volatility 
ameren s electric marketing strategy is to extract additional value from its generation facilities by selling energy in excess of needs into the long term and short term markets for term sales  and purchasing energy when the market price is less than the cost of generation 
our primary use of derivatives has involved transactions that are expected to reduce price risk exposure for us 
with regard to our exposure to commodity price risk for purchased power and excess electricity sales  ameren has a subsidiary  ameren energy  whose primary responsibility includes managing market risks associated with changing market prices for electricity purchased and sold on behalf of ue and genco 
in addition  genco has sold nearly all of its available non rate regulated peak generation capacity for the summer of at various prices  the majority of which are fixed 
fair value of contracts most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales 
however  we utilize derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas  fuel  electricity and emission credits 
price fluctuations in natural gas  fuel and electricity cause o an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our firm commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sales prices under the firm commitment are compared with current commodity prices  o market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power to differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory under firm commitment  and o actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities to differ from anticipated cash outlays 
the derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are dictated by risk management policies and include forward contracts  futures contracts  options and swaps 
we continually assess our supply and delivery commitment positions against forward market prices and internally forecasted forward prices and modify our exposure to market  credit and operational risk by entering into various offsetting transactions 
in general  we believe these transactions serve to reduce our price risk
