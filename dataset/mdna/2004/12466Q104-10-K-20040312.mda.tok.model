item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements this report contains statements concerning the corporation s expectations  plans  objectives  future financial performance and other statements that are not historical facts 
these statements may constitute forward looking statements as defined by federal securities laws 
these statements may address issues that involve estimates and assumptions made by management  risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from historical results or those anticipated by such statements 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the corporation include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  the legislative regulatory climate  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in the corporation s market area and accounting principles  policies and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements contained herein  and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
the following discussion supplements and provides information about the major components of the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of the corporation 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
those accounting policies that required management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions  or using different assumptions  are described below 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents an amount that  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
management s judgment in determining the adequacy of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans while taking into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions which may affect a borrower s ability to repay  overall portfolio quality and review of specific potential losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
impairment of loans impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the corporation considers a loan impaired when it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
a loan is not considered impaired during a period of delay in payment if the ultimate collection of all amounts due is expected 
a valuation allowance is maintained to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment 

table of contents impairment of securities impairment of investment securities results in a write down that should be included in net income when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
management regularly reviews each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market  the duration of that market decline  the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer and management s intentions with regard to holding the security to maturity 
valuation of derivatives the corporation enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding ie  rate lock commitments 
rate lock commitments on mortgage loans that are intended to be sold are considered to be derivatives 
the period of time between issuance of a loan commitment and closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from to days 
for such rate lock commitments  the corporation protects itself from changes in interest rates through the use of best efforts forward delivery commitments  whereby an investor commits to buy the loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the investor has assumed the interest rate risk on the loan 
as of december   the corporation s securities portfolio included investments in structured notes  more specifically step up agency bonds 
in general  structured notes are debt securities whose cash flow characteristics coupon rate  redemption amount or stated maturity depend upon one or more indices and or that have embedded forwards or options 
step up securities initially pay the investor an above market yield for a short noncall period and then  if not called  step up to a higher coupon rate  which will be below current market rates 
the investor initially receives a higher yield because of having implicitly sold one or more call options 
as of december   the amortized cost of million of the corporation s investment in step up agency bonds equaled its estimated fair value 
the corporation has not entered into any other derivative transactions 
goodwill on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  all of which was recognized in connection with the bank s acquisition of moore loans  inc in september  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the corporation completed the annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of and determined there was no impairment to be recognized in if the underlying estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
defined benefit pension plan the bank maintains a non contributory  defined benefit pension plan for eligible full time employees as defined by the plan 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and annual pension and postretirement benefit expense are determined by actuaries using a number of key assumptions 
key assumptions include the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
changes in these assumptions in the future  if any  may impact pension expense as measured in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the corporation s effective tax rate 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcomes are uncertain 
additionally  the corporation s tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
although management believes that the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual 

table of contents for further information concerning accounting policies  refer to note of the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
overview the corporation s primary financial goals are to maximize its earnings and to deploy capital in profitable growth initiatives that will enhance shareholder value 
management tracks three primary performance measures in order to assess the level of success in achieving these goals i growth in earnings  ii return on average assets roa and iii return on average equity roe 
in addition to these financial performance measures  management tracks the performance of the corporation s three principal business activities retail banking  mortgage banking and consumer finance 
the corporation reported net income for of million  or per diluted share 
this represents a increase and a increase in net income and earnings per diluted share  respectively  over the comparable amounts in the corporation s roa was for the year ended december  compared to for  and its roe was for the year ended december  compared to for by all of its financial performance measures  was a successful year for the corporation with record earnings led by the mortgage banking segment  expansion of the mortgage and retail banking segments into a number of new markets and the full integration of the consumer finance segment  which was acquired on september  management expects the following factors to influence the corporation s financial performance in interest rate volatility  which will likely continue to affect demand for home mortgage loans in the mortgage banking segment and short term interest rate compression in the retail banking segment  general economic trends in the corporation s markets  which can affect the quality of the loan portfolios in the retail banking and consumer finance segments  the ability to expand the mortgage banking segment by opening or acquiring new production offices  in conjunction with the expansion of its product offerings in cooperation with the retail banking segment  the ability to expand the retail banking segment by opening or acquiring new branches  loan demand at the retail banking segment  the extent to which deposit and loan growth at the new retail banking branch in newport news  virginia creates market penetration on the virginia peninsula  the extent to which loan demand is affected by the increasingly competitive environment in the consumer finance segment  and the effectiveness of updated technology at the consumer finance segment in enhancing dealer relationships and improving operational efficiencies 
an overview of the financial results for each of the corporation s principal segments is presented below 
a more detailed discussion is included in the section results of operations 

table of contents retail banking pre tax earnings for the retail banking segment were million for the year ended december   compared to million in included in earnings for was a non recurring tax free insurance benefit of  which was received in the second quarter of excluding this benefit  recurring pre tax earnings for the retail banking segment were million for the following table presents the reconciliation of the change in pre tax earnings of the retail banking segment to the increase in recurring pre tax earnings for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  increase decrease pre tax earnings  as reported nonrecurring insurance benefit recurring pre tax earnings recurring pre tax earnings is a non gaap financial measure because it excludes from pre tax earnings a tax free insurance benefit which is included in pre tax earnings for under gaap 
the insurance benefit is non recurring 
management believes the presentation of recurring pre tax earnings is meaningful to the discussion of comparative pre tax earnings for the retail banking segment for the years ended december  and because the decline in pre tax earnings  as reported  is not indicative of the trend in the core business of the retail banking segment 
as such  management has used recurring pre tax earnings in its own assessments of the business of the retail banking segment 
the increase in recurring pre tax earnings for the comparative twelve month periods is primarily a result of higher average earning assets  principally funded by growth in deposits  and an increase in non interest income  partially offset by an increase in non interest expense 
the increase in average earning assets is a result of a higher average balance of loans by the retail banking segment to the mortgage banking and the consumer finance segments  as well as an increase in loans to third party customers 
the increase in non interest income is a result of the effect of deposit growth on deposit service charges  a full year of fees from the overdraft program implemented by the bank during and the gains on calls of securities that resulted from the low interest rate environment 
the increase in non interest expense is a result of an increase in salaries and benefits as the bank continues to add staff to support growth 
during the third quarter of  the retail banking segment opened a new branch in mechanicsville  virginia and began to hire employees for the expansion into the virginia peninsula region 
mortgage banking pre tax earnings for the mortgage banking segment increased approximately million to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in earnings is attributable to a strong demand for mortgage loans  as well as the october addition of a new loan production office in fredericksburg  virginia and an increase in loan officers at existing loan production offices 
for  the amount of loan originations at c f mortgage resulting from refinancings was million compared to million in loans originated for new and resale home purchases for these two time periods were million and million  respectively 
as mortgage rates began to increase in the third quarter of  the mortgage banking segment experienced a decline in the number of applications for home purchase and refinance loans  which resulted in a decrease in originations and sales of loans during the fourth quarter of management expects that future earnings for the mortgage banking segment will be negatively affected if the upward trend in interest rates continues and there are fewer new and resale home sales and loan refinancings 
consumer finance on september   the bank purchased moore loans 
pre tax earnings for the consumer finance segment  consisting solely of moore loans  totaled million for the twelve months ended december   compared to pre tax earnings from september  the date of acquisition through december  of million 
earnings for were enhanced as a result of an increase in loans outstanding and lower funding costs attributable to the low interest rate environment 
the consumer finance segment serves customers who have limited access to traditional automobile financing because they have experienced prior credit difficulties or have modest incomes 
as a result  the consumer finance segment incurs a higher level of credit 
table of contents losses and a higher provision for loan losses than traditional bank consumer financing 
these credit losses are anticipated  accordingly  this segment charges interest at higher rates 
future earnings at the consumer finance segment will be impacted by economic conditions including  but not limited to  the current employment market  interest rates and the resale market for used automobiles

the taxable equivalent yield on the corporation s securities portfolio declined from for to for as a result of the maturities and calls of higher yielding securities  coupled with the reinvestment of proceeds in lower yielding securities 
the decrease in the cost of funds for was a result of lower rates on interest bearing deposits  money market deposits and savings accounts and the repricing of maturing certificates of deposit at lower rates  offset in part by higher cost funds related to moore loans

as part of the purchase price of moore loans  the bank issued million in subordinated debt to the former shareholders of moore loans at interest 
the million loan and the million in subordinated debt were repaid in the fourth quarter of the corporation began experiencing noticeable net interest margin compression in the fourth quarter of management expects net interest margin compression to continue until such time as interest rates on the bank s variable rate loans begin to increase and the bank is able to increase loans to third parties and reduce deposits at other banks

table of contents asset quality allowance and provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an amount that  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the following table presents the corporation s loan loss experience for the periods indicated table allowance for loan losses year ended december  dollars in thousands allowance  beginning of period provision for loan losses retail banking and mortgage banking consumer finance total provision for loan losses loans charged off real estate residential mortgage real estate construction commercial  financial and agricultural consumer consumer finance total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off real estate residential mortgage commercial  financial and agricultural consumer consumer finance total recoveries net loans charged off acquisition of moore loans allowance  end of period ratio of net charge offs to average total loans outstanding during period for consumer finance ratio of net charge offs to average total loans outstanding during period for retail banking and mortgage banking the consumer finance segment  consisting solely of moore loans  accounted for the majority of the activity in the allowance for loan losses during moore loans serves customers who have limited access to traditional automobile financing 
moore loans typical borrowers have experienced prior credit difficulties or have modest income 
because moore loans serves customers who are unable to meet the credit standards imposed by most traditional automobile financing sources  moore loans expects to sustain a higher level of credit losses than traditional automobile financing sources 
as moore loans provides financing in a relatively higher risk market  moore loans generally charges interest at higher rates than those charged by traditional financing sources 
in addition to maintaining the allowance for loan losses  moore loans retains dealer reserves that are established at the time a loan is made and are specific to each individual dealer 
loans charged off at moore loans are first charged to the dealer reserves  to the extent that an individual dealer has reserves  and the remainder is 
table of contents charged to the allowance for loan losses 
dealer reserves are a liability of moore loans and payable to individual dealers upon the termination of the relationship with moore loans and the payment of outstanding loans associated with the specific dealer 
the following table summarizes the dealer reserves activity for the year ended december  in thousands dealer reserves  beginning of year reserve holdback at loan origination loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off dealer reserves  end of year effective january   moore loans will no longer originate loans with a dealer reserve provision 
existing dealer reserves at december  will be retained to absorb future losses for each dealer with a dealer reserve balance at december  the provision for loan losses and the corresponding allowance for loan losses at the consumer finance segment will increase in future periods as dealer reserves are reduced to zero by virtue of loan charge offs or the termination of dealer relationships 
the increase in the provision for loan losses will be offset to some degree by the elimination of the amortization of the dealer holdback  which is a reduction in the consumer finance loan yield 
the corporation conducts an analysis of the loan portfolio on a regular basis 
this analysis is used in assessing the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses and in the determination of the necessary provision for loan losses 
the review process generally begins with loan officers identifying problem loans to be reviewed on an individual basis for impairment 
in addition to these loans  all commercial loans are considered for individual impairment testing 
impairment testing includes consideration of the current collateral value of the loan  as well as any known internal or external factors that may affect collectibility 
when a loan has been identified as impaired  a specific allowance may be established based on the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed fair value 
the loans meeting the criteria for special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss  as well as impaired loans  are segregated from performing loans within the portfolio 
loans are then grouped by loan type eg  commercial  consumer and by risk rating eg  substandard  doubtful 
each loan type is assigned an allowance factor based on the associated risk  complexity and size of the individual loans within the particular loan category 
classified loans are assigned a higher allowance factor than non rated loans within a particular loan type based on management s concerns regarding collectibility or management s knowledge of particular elements surrounding the borrower 
allowance factors increase with the severity of classification 
allowance factors used for unclassified loans are based on management s analysis of charge off history and management s judgment based on the overall analysis of the lending environment including the general economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses is the aggregate of specific allowances  the calculated allowance required for classified loans by category and the general allowance for each portfolio type 
in conjunction with the methodology described above  management considers the following risk elements that are inherent in the loan portfolio residential real estate loans and equity lines of credit carry risks associated with the continued credit worthiness of the borrower and changes in the value of the collateral 
construction loans carry risks that the project will not be finished according to schedule  the project will not be finished according to budget and the value of the collateral may at any point in time be less than the principal amount of the loan 
construction loans also bear the risk that the general contractor  who may or may not be a bank loan customer  is unable to finish the construction project as planned because of financial pressure unrelated to the project 

table of contents commercial real estate loans may carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business or a real estate project  in addition to other risks associated with the ownership of real estate  because the repayment of these loans may be dependent upon the profitability and cash flows of the business or property commercial business loans carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business  which is usually the source of loan repayment  and the value of the collateral  which may depreciate over time and cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate 
consumer loans carry risks associated with the continued credit worthiness of the borrower and the value of the collateral eg  rapidly depreciable assets such as automobiles  or lack thereof 
consumer loans are more likely than real estate loans to be immediately adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
the allocation of the allowance at december for the years indicated and the ratio of related outstanding loan balances to total loans are as follows table allocation of allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands allocation of allowance for loan losses  end of year real estate residential mortgage real estate construction commercial  financial and agricultural equity lines consumer consumer finance unallocated balance  december ratio of loans to total year end loans real estate residential mortgage real estate construction commercial  financial and agricultural equity lines consumer consumer finance includes loans secured by real estate non performing assets non performing assets of the combined retail and mortgage banking segments  as shown in table  decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in non performing assets was a result of a decline in real estate owned 
two of the three properties held at december  were sold in at a net gain of  the decrease in real estate owned was offset in part by an increase in nonaccrual loans 
this increase did not result from a single relationship or concentration  rather it occurred in several small balance loans 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses of the combined retail and mortgage banking segments was million at december  and million at december  the allowance approximates and of total loans outstanding at december  and december   respectively 
this increase is a result of the higher level of accruing loans past due days or more and an increase in reserves for one particular commercial real estate relationship  which became more than days delinquent after december  management is monitoring this relationship very closely 
the principal balance outstanding of this relationship is million and management has established a specific reserve of  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
as shown in table  non accrual assets of the consumer finance segment increased to million at december  from  at december  the corresponding allowance for loan losses was million at december  and million at december   and dealer reserves were million at december  and the ratio of the combined allowance for loans losses and dealer reserves to total consumer finance loans increased to at december  from at december  as a result of the higher level of non accrual loans and the increase in charge off activity 
during periods of economic slowdown or recession  delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and losses generally increase at the consumer finance segment 
these periods also may be accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding loans  which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default 
significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic recession may also depress the prices at which repossessed automobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales 
because moore loans focuses on non prime borrowers  the actual rates of delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and losses on these loans are higher than those experienced in the general automobile finance industry and could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn 
while moore loans seeks to manage the higher risk inherent in loans made to non prime borrowers through underwriting criteria and collection methods it employs  no assurance can be given that these criteria or methods will afford adequate protection against these risks 
however  management believes that the current allowance for loan losses and dealer reserves are adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans in the consumer finance segment that may become uncollectible 
loans at the retail banking  mortgage banking and consumer finance segments are generally placed on non accrual status when the collection of principal or interest is days or more past due  or earlier  if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower 
loans greater than days past due may remain on accrual status if management determines it has adequate collateral to cover the principal and interest 
for those loans  which are carried on non accrual status  interest is recognized on a cash basis 
at the consumer finance segment  automobiles securing the loans are generally repossessed after a loan becomes more than days delinquent 
repossessions are handled by independent repossession firms engaged by moore loans and must be approved by a collections officer 
upon repossession and after any prescribed waiting period  the repossessed automobile is sold at auction 
moore loans does not sell any vehicles on a retail basis 
the proceeds from the sale of the automobile at auction  and any other recoveries  are credited against the balance of the loan 
auction proceeds from the sale of the repossessed vehicle and other recoveries are usually not sufficient to cover the outstanding balance of the loan  and the resulting deficiency is charged off 
the charge off represents the difference between the actual net sales proceeds and the amount of the delinquent loan  including accrued interest 
moore loans pursues collection of deficiencies when it deems such action to be appropriate 

table of contents for those loans  which are carried on non accrual status  interest is recognized on a cash basis 
additional gross interest income of   and  would have been recorded for  and  respectively  if non accrual loans had been current throughout these periods 
interest income received on non accrual loans was   and  for the periods ended december   and  respectively 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the corporation considers a loan impaired when it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
a loan is not considered impaired during a period of delay in payment if the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due is expected 
a valuation allowance is maintained to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment 
the balances of impaired loans at december  and were million and million  respectively 
a valuation allowance of  has been provided for one relationship included in impaired loans at december  there was no specific valuation allowance associated with impaired loans at december  the average balances of impaired loans for and were million and million  respectively

table of contents residential mortgage lending held for investment the retail banking segment originates residential mortgage loans secured by properties located in its primary market area in southeastern central virginia 
the bank offers various types of residential mortgage loans in addition to traditional long term  fixed rate loans 
such loans include and year amortizing mortgage loans with fixed rates of interest and fixed rate mortgage loans with terms of years but subject to call after five  seven or ten years at the option of the bank 
the bank underwrites the loans on terms consistent with pre existing secondary mortgage market standards 
loans associated with residential mortgage lending are included in the real estate residential mortgage category in table construction lending the retail banking segment has an active construction lending program 
the bank makes loans primarily for the construction of one to four family residences and  to a lesser extent  multi family dwellings 
the bank also makes construction loans for office and warehouse facilities and other nonresidential projects generally limited to borrowers that present other business opportunities for the bank 
the amounts  interest rates and terms for construction loans vary  depending upon market conditions  the size and complexity of the project  and the financial strength of the borrower and the guarantors of the loan 
the term for the bank s typical construction loan ranges from to months for the construction of an individual residence and from months to a maximum of three years for larger residential or commercial projects 
the bank does not typically amortize its construction loans  and the borrower pays interest monthly on the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
the bank s construction loans generally have a floating or variable rate of interest plus a margin but occasionally have a fixed interest rate 
the bank does not generally finance the construction of commercial real estate projects built on a speculative basis 
for residential builder loans  the bank limits the number of models and or speculative units allowed depending on market conditions  the builder s financial strength and track record  and other factors 
generally  the maximum loan to value ratio for one to four family residential construction loans is of the property s fair market value  or of the property s fair market value if the property will be the borrower s primary residence 
the fair market value of a project is determined on the basis of an appraisal of the project usually conducted by an independent  outside appraiser acceptable to the bank 
for larger projects where unit absorption or leasing is a concern  the bank may also obtain a feasibility study or other acceptable information from the borrower or other sources about the likely disposition of the property following the completion of construction 
construction loans for nonresidential projects and multi unit residential projects are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk to the bank than residential mortgage loans 
the bank attempts to minimize such risks by making construction loans in accordance with the bank s underwriting standards to established customers in its primary market area and by monitoring the quality  progress  and cost of construction 
the maximum loan to value ratio established by the bank for non residential projects and multi unit residential projects is  however  this maximum can be waived for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis 
loans associated with construction lending are included in the real estate construction category in table 
table of contents consumer lot lending consumer lot loans are loans made to individuals for the purpose of acquiring an unimproved building site for the construction of a residence to be occupied by the borrower 
consumer lot loans are made only to individual borrowers  and each borrower generally must certify to the bank his intention to build and occupy a single family residence on his lot generally within three or five years of the date of origination of the loan 
these loans typically have a maximum term of either three or five years with a balloon payment of the entire balance of the loan being due in full at the end of the initial term 
the interest rate for these loans is usually a fixed rate that is slightly higher than prevailing fixed rates for one to four family residential mortgage loans 
management does not view consumer lot loans as bearing as much risk as land acquisition and development loans because such loans are not made for the construction of residences for immediate resale  are not made to developers and builders  and are not concentrated in any one subdivision or community 
loans associated with consumer lot lending are included in the real estate construction category in table commercial real estate lending the bank s commercial real estate loans are primarily secured by the value of real property and the income arising from such property 
the proceeds of commercial real estate loans are generally used by the borrower to finance or refinance the cost of acquiring and or improving a commercial property 
the properties that typically secure these loans are office and warehouse facilities  hotels  retail facilities  restaurants and other commercial properties 
the bank s present policy is generally to restrict the making of commercial real estate loans to borrowers who will occupy or use the financed property in connection with their normal business operations 
however  the bank will also consider making commercial real estate loans under the following two conditions 
first  the bank will consider making commercial real estate loans for other purposes if the borrower is in strong financial condition and presents a substantial business opportunity for the bank 
second  the bank will consider making commercial real estate loans to creditworthy borrowers who have substantially pre leased the improvements to high caliber tenants 
generally  such loans require full amortization over a lesser term than the normal year amortization period 
commercial real estate loans are usually amortized over a period of time ranging from years to years and usually have a term to maturity ranging from years to years 
these loans normally have provisions for interest rate adjustments generally after the loan is three to five years old 
the bank s maximum loan to value ratio for a commercial real estate loan is  however  this maximum can be waived for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis 
most commercial real estate loans are further secured by one or more unconditional personal guarantees 
in recent years  the bank has structured many of its commercial real estate loans as mini permanent loans 
the amortization period  term and interest rates for these loans vary based on borrower preferences and the bank s assessment of the loan and the degree of risk involved 
if the borrower prefers a fixed rate of interest  the bank usually offers a loan with a fixed rate of interest for a term of three to five years with an amortization period of up to years 
the remaining balance of the loan is due and payable in a single balloon payment at the end of the initial term 
additionally  the bank offers a fixed rate of interest for up to years for loans that fully amortize during the year term 
if the borrower prefers a variable or floating rate of interest  the bank usually offers a loan with an interest rate indexed to the bank s prime rate plus a margin for a term of five years with the remaining 
table of contents balance of the loan due and payable in a single balloon payment at the end of five years 
management of the bank believes that shorter maturities for commercial real estate loans are necessary to give the bank some protection from changes in the borrower s business and income as well as changes in general economic conditions 
in the case of fixed rate commercial real estate loans  shorter maturities also provide the bank with an opportunity to adjust the interest rate on this type of interest earning asset in accordance with the bank s asset liability management strategies 
loans secured by commercial real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are usually dependent on successful operation or management of the properties securing such loans  repayment of such loans is subject to changes in both general and local economic conditions and the borrower s business and income 
as a result  events beyond the control of the bank  such as a downturn in the local economy  could adversely affect the performance of the bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks by lending to established customers and generally restricting its commercial real estate loans to its primary market area 
emphasis is placed on the income producing characteristics and capacity of the collateral 
loans associated with commercial real estate lending are included in the commercial  financial and agricultural category in table land acquisition and development lending land acquisition and development loans are loans made to builders and developers for the purpose of acquiring unimproved land to be developed for residential building sites  residential housing subdivisions  multi family dwellings  and a variety of commercial uses 
the bank s present policy is to make land acquisition loans to borrowers for the purpose of acquiring developed lots for single family  townhouse or condominium construction 
the bank will also make land acquisition and development loans to residential builders  experienced developers and others in strong financial condition in order to provide additional construction and mortgage lending opportunities for the bank 
land acquisition and development loans are underwritten and processed by the bank in much the same manner as commercial construction loans and commercial real estate loans 
the bank uses a lower loan to value ratio for these types of loans  which is a maximum of for unimproved land and of the discounted appraised value of the property as determined in accordance with the bank s appraisal policies for developed lots for single family or townhouse construction 
the maximum loan to value ratio can be waived for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis 
the term of land acquisition and development loans ranges from a maximum of two years for loans relating to the acquisition of unimproved land to generally  a maximum of three years for other types of projects 
all land acquisition and development loans are generally further secured by one or more unconditional personal guarantees 
because these loans are usually in a larger amount and involve more risk than consumer lot loans  the bank carefully evaluates the borrower s assumptions and projections about market conditions and absorption rates in the community in which the property is located and the borrower s ability to carry the loan if the borrower s assumptions prove inaccurate 
loans associated with land acquisition and development lending are included in the commercial  financial and agricultural category in table 
table of contents commercial business lending commercial business loan products include revolving lines of credit to provide working capital  term loans to finance the purchase of vehicles and equipment  letters of credit to guarantee payment and performance  and other commercial loans 
in general  these credit facilities carry the unconditional guaranty of the owners and or stockholders 
revolving and operating lines of credit are typically secured by all current assets of the borrower  provide for the acceleration of repayment upon any event of default  are monitored monthly or quarterly to ensure compliance with loan covenants  and are re underwritten or renewed annually 
interest rates generally will float at a spread tied to the bank s prime lending rate 
term loans are generally advanced for the purchase of  and are secured by  vehicles and equipment and are normally fully amortized over a term of from two to five years  on either a fixed or floating rate basis 
loans associated with commercial business lending are included in the commercial  financial and agricultural category in table home equity and second mortgage lending the bank offers its customers home equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans that enable customers to borrow funds secured by the equity in their homes 
currently  home equity lines of credit are offered with adjustable rates of interest that are generally priced at the prime lending rate plus a spread 
second mortgage loans are offered with fixed and adjustable rates 
call option provisions are included in the loan documents for some longer term  fixed rate second mortgage loans  and these provisions allow the bank to make interest rate adjustments for such loans 
second mortgage loans are granted for a fixed period of time  usually between five and twenty years  and home equity lines of credit are made on an open end  revolving basis 
home equity loans  second mortgage loans and other consumer loans secured by a personal residence generally do not present as much risk to the bank as other types of consumer loans 
loans associated with home equity and second mortgage lending are included in the equity lines category in table consumer lending the bank offers a variety of consumer loans  including automobile  personal secured and unsecured  credit card  and loans secured by savings accounts or certificates of deposit 
the bank offers consumer loans to its customers because the shorter terms and generally higher interest rates on such loans help the bank maintain a profitable spread between its average loan yield and its cost of funds 
consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans 
consumer loans secured by collateral other than a personal residence generally involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans because of the type and nature of the collateral or  in certain cases  the absence of collateral 
however  the bank believes the higher yields generally earned on such loans compensate for the increased credit risk associated with such loans 
loans associated with consumer lending are included in the consumer category in table 
table of contents automobile sales finance moore loans has an extensive automobile dealer network from which it buys automobile loan contracts through its branch offices 
branch personnel have a specific credit authority based upon their experience and historical loan portfolio results  as well as established underwriting criteria 
although the credit approval process is decentralized  moore loan s application processing system includes controls designed to ensure that credit decisions comply with its underwriting policies and procedures 
finance contract application packages completed by prospective borrowers are received from automobile dealers via facsimile or by telephone 
once the application is received  a credit bureau report is accessed 
moore loan personnel with credit authority review the application package and determine whether to approve the application  approve the application subject to conditions that must be met or deny the application 
the credit decision is based primarily on the applicant s credit history  current employment status and collateral 
moore loan s underwriting and collateral guidelines form the basis for the credit decision 
exceptions to credit policies and authorities must be approved by a designated credit officer 
moore loans typical borrowers have experienced prior credit difficulties or have modest income 
because moore loans serves customers who are unable to meet the credit standards imposed by most traditional automobile financing sources  the consumer finance segment is expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than traditional automobile financing sources 
however  moore loans generally charges interest at higher rates than those charged by traditional financing sources  the impact of which should more than offset the increase in the provision for loan losses for this segment of the corporation s loan portfolio

off balance sheet arrangements the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  commitments to sell loans  and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in addition to the amount on the balance sheet 
the corporation s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit written is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral is obtained based on management s credit assessment of the customer in each circumstance 
loan commitments are agreements to extend credit to a customer provided that there are no violations of the terms of the contract prior to funding 
commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer 
since many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the total amount of loan commitments was  and  at december  and  respectively 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers

table of contents as a result of the corporation s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  management believes that the corporation maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its operational requirements and contractual obligations 
capital resources the assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as asset quality  liquidity  earnings performance  and changing competitive conditions and economic forces 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of the corporation s capital 
management seeks to maintain a structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses 
during  the corporation repurchased  shares of its common stock  or of the shares outstanding as of december   in the open market at prices between and per share 
these repurchases were made to reduce capital since it was high relative to the corporation s asset size and planned growth 
no shares were repurchased during in january  the corporation s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of the corporation s common stock over the next twelve months 
the stock may be purchased in the open market and or in privately negotiated transactions as management and the board of directors determines prudent 
the amount and timing of the stock repurchases will be based on various factors  such as management s assessment of the corporation s capital structure and liquidity  the market price of the corporation s common stock compared to management s assessment of the stock s underlying value  and applicable regulatory  legal and accounting factors 
the corporation s board of directors authorized the stock repurchase program because the corporation s capital level exceeds its ongoing operational needs and regulatory requirements 
while management will continue to look for opportunities to invest capital in profitable growth  the share repurchase authorization is another tool that facilitates improving shareholder return  as measured by roe and earnings per share 
the corporation s capital position continues to exceed regulatory requirements

effects of inflation the effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different from other industries as the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
interest rates are significantly impacted by inflation  but neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes are directly related to price level indices 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the impacts of inflation on interest rates  loan demands and deposits 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management as the holding company for a commercial bank  the corporation s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuation in interest rates will ultimately affect the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of the corporation s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
since the majority of the corporation s interest earning assets and all of the corporation s interest bearing liabilities are held by the bank  virtually all of the corporation s interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level 
therefore  management of the bank performs all significant interest rate risk management procedures 
based on the nature of the bank s operations  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the retail banking loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in the virginia counties of king william  king and queen  hanover  henrico  chesterfield  middlesex  new kent  charles city  york  and james city  and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the consumer finance loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in eastern  central and southwest virginia and portions of eastern tennessee and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with the local economy 
as of december   the corporation does not own any trading assets nor does it have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps or caps 
the corporation enters into commitments to originate residential mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding ie  rate lock commitments 
such rate lock commitments on mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market are considered to be derivatives 
the period of time between issuance of a loan commitment and closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from to days 
the corporation protects itself from changes in interest rates through the use of best efforts forward delivery commitments  whereby the corporation commits to sell a loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the buyer has assumed interest rate risk on the loan 
as a result  the corporation is not exposed to losses nor will it realize gains related to its rate lock commitments due to changes in interest rates 
the bank s interest rate management strategy is designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital 
the bank manages interest rate risk through the use of a simulation model that measures the sensitivity of future net interest income and the net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
in addition  the bank monitors interest rate sensitivity through analysis  measuring the terms to maturity or next repricing date of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the matching of the maturities of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based on certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based on certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to result in a decrease in net interest income 
in a declining interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a greater decrease in the yield on interest earning assets relative to the cost of its liabilities and thus a decrease in net interest income 
an institution with a negative gap would be expected to experience the opposite result 

table of contents certain shortcomings are inherent in any method of analysis used to estimate a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
the analysis is based at a given point in time and does not take into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities also may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
the interest rates on loans with call features may or may not change depending on their interest rates relative to market interest rates 
the corporation is also subject to prepayment risk  particularly in falling interest rate environments or in environments where the slope of the yield curve is relatively flat or negative 
such changes in the interest rate environment can cause substantial changes in the level of prepayments of loans  which may also affect the corporation s interest rate sensitivity gap position 
the methodologies used for interest rate management estimate various rates of withdrawal for money market deposits  savings  and checking accounts  which may vary significantly from actual experience 
as part of its borrowings  the corporation may utilize  from time to time  daily  convertible  fixed and adjustable rate advances from the fhlb 
convertible advances generally provide for a fixed rate of interest for a portion of the term of the advance  an ability for the fhlb to convert the advance from a fixed rate to an adjustable rate at some predetermined time during the remaining term of the advance the conversion feature  and a concurrent opportunity for the corporation to prepay the advance with no prepayment penalty in the event the fhlb elects to exercise the conversion feature 
the interest rates paid on borrowings with convertible features may or may not change depending on their interest rates relative to market interest rates 
also  the corporation has an adjustable rate revolving line of credit with a third party bank that partially funds the lending activities of moore loans 
table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   that are subject to repricing or that mature in each of the time periods shown 
additionally  loans  securities and borrowings with call or convertible provisions are included in the period in which they may first be called 
except as stated above  the amount of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the asset or liability

the corporation believes that the assumptions utilized are reasonable 
the expected maturity date values for loans were calculated by adjusting the instruments contractual maturity date for expectations of prepayments  as set forth in the notes 
similarly  expected maturity date values for interest bearing core deposits were calculated based on estimates of the period over which the deposits would be outstanding  as set forth in the notes 
from a risk management perspective  however  the corporation utilizes both maturity and repricing dates  as opposed to solely using expected maturity dates as shown in the following schedule 
as shown in table  there have been several significant changes in the maturities of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities in that are attributable to factors other than overall growth 
the decrease in loans held for sale maturing within one year is a result of decreased production at c f mortgage 
all loans originated at c f mortgage are usually sold within one month of loan closing 
the increase in securities maturing within one year and the decrease in the corresponding yield is a result of the deployment of excess liquidity from overnight interest bearing accounts into short term investments prior to year end 
the decrease in borrowings maturing within one year is a result of excess liquidity reducing the need to fund operations with short term fhlb advances 
the decline in long term borrowings is a result of the pay off of fixed rate subordinated debt and a fixed rate loan with a third party bank that partially funded the acquisition of moore loans 
the decrease in the yield on variable rate loans  securities and deposits  including certificates of deposits  is a result of the decrease in interest rates through and
