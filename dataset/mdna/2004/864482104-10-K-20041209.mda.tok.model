on different occasions  we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements in other filings that we make with the sec  in press releases or in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking or cautionary statements  which reflect management s opinions only as of the date made 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking or cautionary statement 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this annual report and in future sec reports 
the following are factors that regularly affect our operating results and financial condition product costs the level of profitability in the retail propane and fuel oil businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost 
the unit cost of propane and fuel oil is subject to volatile changes as a result of product supply or other market conditions  including  but not limited to  economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing 
propane and fuel oil unit cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product cost increases fully or immediately  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
therefore  average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as product costs fluctuate with propane  fuel oil  crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions 
seasonality the retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses  as well as the natural gas marketing business  are seasonal because of propane and fuel oil s primary use for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season from october through march 
the fuel oil business which we recently acquired through the agway acquisition tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating and we expect that approximately three fourths of our fuel oil volumes will be sold between october and march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the winter heating season 
we expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
to the extent necessary  we will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to unitholders in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products  in particular propane  fuel oil and natural gas  for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many of our customers rely heavily on propane or fuel oil as a heating source 
accordingly  the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas  which can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane and fuel oil use  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater use 
risk management propane product supply contracts are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal and generally permit suppliers to charge posted market prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
since rapid increases in the cost of propane or fuel oil may not be immediately passed on to retail customers  such increases could reduce profitability 
during fiscal  approximately of our fuel oil volumes were made to individual customers under agreements pre establishing a fixed or maximum price per gallon over a twelve month period 
the fixed or maximum price at which fuel oil is sold to these price plan customers is generally renegotiated based on current market conditions prior to the start of the heating season 
we engage in risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to help ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply 
we are currently a party to propane futures contracts traded on the nymex and enter into forward and option agreements with third parties to purchase and sell propane at fixed prices in the future 
additionally  we enter into derivative instruments in the form of futures and options traded on the nymex covering a substantial majority of the fuel oil we expect to sell to customers under fixed or maximum price protection plans in an effort to protect margins under these programs 
risk management activities are monitored by an internal commodity risk management committee  made up of five members of management  through enforcement of our hedging and risk management policy and reported to our audit committee 
risk management transactions may not always result in increased product margins 
see additional discussion in item a of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results 
estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  employee benefit plans  self insurance and legal reserves  environmental reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  asset valuation assessments and valuation of derivative instruments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note  summary of significant accounting policies  included within the notes to consolidated financial statements section elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of propane  fuel oil and other refined fuels at the time product is delivered to the customer 
revenue from the sale of appliances and equipment is recognized at the time of sale or when installation is complete  as applicable 
revenue from repairs  maintenance and other service activities is recognized upon completion of the service 
revenue from hvac service contracts is recognized ratably over the service period 
revenue from our natural gas and electricity business is recognized based on customer usage as determined by meter readings 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate our allowances for doubtful accounts using a specific reserve for known or anticipated uncollectible accounts  as well as an estimated reserve for potential future uncollectible accounts taking into consideration our historical write offs 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we estimate the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
see pension plan assets and obligations below for additional disclosure regarding pension benefits 
self insurance reserves 
our accrued insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product  workers compensation and automobile insurance policies 
accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data 
for each claim  we record a self insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data 
we maintain insurance coverage wherein our net exposure for insured claims is limited to the insurance deductible  claims above which are paid by our insurance carriers 
for the portion of our estimated self insurance liability that exceeds our deductibles  we record an asset related to the amount of the liability to be covered by insurance 
environmental reserves 
we establish reserves for environmental exposures when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based upon our best estimate of costs associated with environmental remediation and ongoing monitoring activities 
accrued environmental reserves are exclusive of claims against third parties  and an asset is established where contribution or reimbursement from such third parties has been agreed and we are reasonably assured of receiving such contribution or reimbursement 
environmental reserves are not discounted 
goodwill impairment assessment 
we assess the carrying value of goodwill at a reporting unit level  at least annually  based on an estimate of the fair value of the respective reporting unit 
fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses taking into consideration estimated cash flows in a ten year projection period and a terminal value calculation at the end of the projection period 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see item a of this annual report for information about accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
executive summary of results of operations and financial condition fiscal marked the beginning of our transformation from a marketer of a single fuel into one that provides multiple energy solutions to over a million customers nationwide 
highlighted by the agway acquisition at the end of the first fiscal quarter  we reported record operating results for fiscal the agway acquisition  which closed on december   expanded our propane operations and diversified our product and service offerings in the northeast energy market with the addition of fuel oil and other refined products distribution  natural gas and electricity marketing  as well as expansion of our hvac sales and service activities 
the total cost of the agway acquisition was approximately million  consisting of the million purchase price net of a million favorable purchase price adjustment for working capital  plus million related to non compete agreements with certain members of management of agway energy and million in fees and expenses associated with the agway acquisition 
we financed the agway acquisition through a combination of million in net proceeds from the issuance of  common units and a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of million in senior notes  both during december beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we took steps to restructure and otherwise integrate the back office functions and certain field management functions of agway energy 
in addition  in march we turned our attention to integrating field operations  migrating the systems environment and capitalizing on anticipated synergies in our combined field operations 
we identified opportunities to combine operating facilities in over markets in the northeast and by the end of fiscal had completed a significant portion of the activities to co locate our employees into one facility  communicate changes to our customer base and merge storage locations 
as a result  our operating results for fiscal reflect restructuring and asset impairment charges  as well as anticipated incremental operating expenses associated with these integration activities and  therefore  our fiscal operating results do not reflect the full impact of the anticipated benefits from the agway acquisition 
the agway energy operations were consolidated from the date of the agway acquisition december  and  therefore  did not have a significant impact on our operating results for the first quarter of fiscal the first three months of the peak heating season 
for fiscal  we reported net income of million  or per common unit  an increase of million compared to net income of million  or per common unit  in fiscal we reported a record level of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to million in fiscal ebitda and net income for fiscal were favorably impacted by the net result of certain significant items  mainly relating to i a million gain from the sale of customer service centers  considered to be non strategic  located primarily in the northern and southern central regions of the united states  compared to a million gain from the sale of nine customer service centers during fiscal  ii a non cash charge of million included within cost of products sold relating to the settlement of futures contracts which were marked to market under purchase accounting for the agway acquisition  iii a non cash pension charge of million related to accelerated recognition of actuarial losses as a result of the level of lump sum benefit payments in fiscal compared to prior years  iv a non cash charge of million attributable to the impairment of goodwill related to a small business acquired in  v a million restructuring charge related to our efforts to integrate certain management and back office functions of agway energy  and  vi a non cash charge of million included within depreciation expense attributable to the write down of assets to be disposed of as a result of the blending of field operations in the northeast 
these significant items had a net positive impact of million and million on the year over year comparison of ebitda and net income  respectively  for fiscal despite warmer than normal nationwide average temperatures during fiscal  retail propane gallons sold increased million gallons  or  to million gallons  compared to million gallons in the prior year  as a result of the addition of the agway energy operations 
nationwide average temperatures  as reported by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa  averaged warmer than normal in fiscal  compared to colder than normal in fiscal  or warmer temperatures year over year 
sales of fuel oil and other refined fuels from the agway energy operations amounted to million gallons during fiscal with the increased earnings  primarily associated with the addition of the agway energy operations  cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal increased million to million  compared to million in the prior year 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took further steps to continue to strengthen our financial position 
on july   we elected to repay the third annual principal payment of million due under our senior notes using cash on hand 
we also made a voluntary contribution of million to improve the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan 
this is the second such voluntary contribution in the past two years  as we made a million voluntary contribution during the fourth quarter of fiscal with our strong operating cash flow and despite our use of cash for debt reduction and the voluntary contribution to our pension plan  we ended fiscal with approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
as we look ahead to fiscal  our operating results will reflect a full year of operations from agway energy  and we expect to benefit from additional operational efficiencies expected as a result of our integration efforts 
however  we expect that our operating results and capital expenditures for fiscal will continue to reflect increased spending for facility and systems integration efforts to assimilate the combined operations 
our anticipated cash requirements for fiscal include i maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately million  ii approximately million of interest payments  iii a principal payment of million due on june  under our senior note agreement  and  iv assuming distributions remain at the current level  approximately million of distributions to common unitholders and the general partner 
the projected level of capital expenditures for fiscal is approximately million higher than our expected annual level of capital spending in subsequent years  primarily as a result of anticipated spending on facility and systems integration 
based on our current estimate of our cash position  availability under the revolving credit agreement unused borrowing capacity under the working capital facility of million at november  and expected cash flow from operating activities  we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues

total revenues increased million  or  to  million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  driven primarily by the agway acquisition 
revenues in our propane segment of million for the fiscal year ended september  increased million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
this increase is the result of higher retail and wholesale propane sales volumes  coupled with an increase in average selling prices in line with higher commodity prices for propane 
despite nationwide average temperatures  as reported by noaa  that were warmer than normal and warmer than the prior year  retail propane gallons sold increased million gallons  or  to million gallons for the fiscal year ended september  the increase is primarily attributable to the addition of agway energy volumes from december   partially offset by the effect of the warmer temperatures 
average selling prices increased approximately as a result of sustained higher commodity prices for propane 
the average posted price of propane during fiscal increased approximately compared to the average posted prices in the prior year 
additionally  included within the propane segment are revenues from wholesale and risk management activities of million for the fiscal year ended september  which increased million  compared to the prior year 
revenue contribution from our fuel oil and other refined fuels and our natural gas and electricity segments amounted to million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended september  from the addition of agway energy since december  total fuel oil and other refined fuel gallons sold in fiscal amounted to million gallons 
revenues from our hvac service and installation activities  as well as from sales of hvac equipment and related parts  of million for the fiscal year ended september  increased million compared to the prior year  primarily due to the addition of agway energy

the cost of products sold reported in the consolidated statements of operations represents the weighted average unit cost of propane and fuel oil sold  as well as the cost of natural gas and electricity  including transportation costs to deliver product from our supply points to storage or to our customer service centers 
cost of products sold also includes the cost of appliances and related parts sold or installed by our customer service centers computed on a basis that approximates the average cost of the products 
cost of products sold is reported exclusive of any depreciation and amortization  these amounts are reported separately within the consolidated statements of operations 
cost of products sold increased million to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase results primarily from the increase in retail propane volumes sold  as well as the addition of fuel oil and other refined fuel sales volumes  which had a combined impact of million on the year over year comparison of cost of products sold 
higher commodity prices for propane during fiscal also increased cost of products sold by million compared to the prior year 
increased wholesale and risk management activities  noted above  increased cost of products sold by million compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold for fiscal year ended september  also included a million non cash charge associated with the settlement of futures contracts that were acquired in the agway acquisition 
as the underlying futures and option contracts were settled  the derivative assets were charged to cost of products sold as an offset to the realized gains from contract settlement 
the impact on cost of products sold represents a non cash charge resulting from the application of purchase accounting on derivative instruments acquired 
in addition  the increase in revenues attributable to our natural gas and electricity and hvac business segments had a million and million impact  respectively  on cost of products sold in the fiscal year ended september  compared to the prior year 
for the fiscal year ended september   cost of products sold represented of revenues compared to in the prior year 
this increase results primarily from the different mix of products sold during fiscal as a result of the additional product offerings from the agway energy operations 
generally  the prices for fuel oil and other refined fuels as a percentage of product revenues tend to be between and higher than propane costs are as a percentage of propane revenues

all costs of operating our retail distribution and appliance sales and service operations are reported within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
these operating expenses include the compensation and benefits of field and direct operating support personnel  costs of operating and maintaining our vehicle fleet  overhead and other costs of our purchasing  training and safety departments and other direct and indirect costs of our customer service centers 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges are recorded in current period earnings within operating expenses 
operating expenses of million for the fiscal year ended september  increased million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
operating expenses for fiscal include a million unrealized non cash loss representing the net change in fair values of derivative instruments during the period  compared to a million unrealized loss in the prior year see item a in this annual report for information on our policies regarding the accounting for derivative instruments 
in addition to the non cash impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments  the most significant impact on operating expenses was the impact on employee  vehicle and facility costs from the addition of the agway energy operations 
additionally  fiscal operating expenses include a million non cash pension charge in order to accelerate the recognition of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses in our defined benefit pension plan 
the accelerated recognition of these losses was recorded in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits sfas as a result of an increase in the level of lump sum benefit payments made to retirees or terminated individuals during fiscal compared to prior years 
operating expenses in fiscal increased primarily in the following areas i employee compensation and benefit costs increased million related to an increase in field personnel and increased earnings  ii costs to operate our fleet increased million  iii operating costs at our customer service centers increased million as a result of the addition of the agway energy operations  iv pension costs increased million primarily as a result of the million non cash charge described above  iv insurance costs increased million  and  v medical costs increased million

general and administrative expenses of million for the fiscal year ended september  were million  or  higher compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the impact of million higher employee compensation and benefit costs as a result of higher earnings and increased overall headcount  as well as million related to transition services fees paid to agway  inc for back office support provided subsequent to the agway acquisition 
in addition  we incurred anticipated increases in marketing  professional services and travel expenses during fiscal associated with our efforts to acquire agway energy during the first quarter and in connection with our integration efforts during the remainder of fiscal restructuring costs and impairment of goodwill 
during fiscal  we recorded a million restructuring charge for severance and other exit costs associated with vacating duplicative facilities and contract terminations in connection with the integration of agway energy operations and management 
while the majority of restructuring and integration activities were completed by the end of fiscal  there may be additional charges in fiscal as we continue to finalize our operating footprint in the northeast 
additionally  during the third quarter of fiscal  as a result of continued losses in one of our reporting units acquired in fiscal  we recorded a non cash charge of million related to goodwill impairment

net interest expense increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september   compared to million in the prior year 
the increase results primarily from the net impact of the addition of million of senior notes associated with financing for the agway acquisition  offset by a reduction in amounts outstanding under our senior notes due to repayment of the second annual principal payment of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal and of the third annual principal payment of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in both cases using cash on hand 
in addition  we incurred a one time fee of million related to financing commitments for the agway acquisition during the first quarter of fiscal which is included within fiscal interest expense 
discontinued operations 
as part of our overall business strategy  we continually monitor and evaluate our existing operations to identify opportunities to optimize return on assets employed by selectively consolidating or divesting operations in slower growing or non strategic markets 
in line with that strategy  during fiscal  we sold customer service centers for net cash proceeds of million 
we recorded a gain on sale of million during fiscal during fiscal  we sold nine customer service centers for net cash proceeds of million and recorded a gain on sale of million 
gains on sale have been accounted for within discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas net income and ebitda 
net income of million for the fiscal year ended september  increased million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
we reported record ebitda of million for the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million  or 
net income and ebitda for fiscal were favorably impacted by the net result of certain significant items  mainly relating to i the million gain from the sale of customer service centers considered to be non strategic  primarily located in the northern and southern central regions of the united states  compared to a million gain from the sale of nine customer service centers during fiscal  ii the non cash charge of million included within cost of products sold relating to the settlement of futures contracts which were marked to market under purchase accounting for the agway acquisition  iii the non cash pension charge of million related to accelerated recognition of actuarial losses as a result of the level of lump sum benefit payments in fiscal  iv the non cash charge of million attributable to the impairment of goodwill related to a small business acquired in  v the million restructuring charge related to our efforts to integrate certain management and back office functions of agway energy  and  vi the non cash charge of million included within depreciation expense attributable to the write down of assets to be disposed of as a result of the blending of field operations in the northeast 
these significant items had a net positive impact of million and million on the year over year comparison of ebitda and net income  respectively  for the fiscal year ended september  ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our management uses ebitda as a measure of liquidity and we are including it because we believe that it provides our investors and industry analysts with additional information to evaluate our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to pay our quarterly distributions to holders of our common units 
moreover  our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement require us to use ebitda as a component in calculating our leverage and interest coverage ratios 
ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda as determined by us excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  it may not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table sets forth i our calculation of ebitda and ii a reconciliation of ebitda  as so calculated  to our net cash provided by operating activities

total revenues increased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues from retail propane activities increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was the result of an increase in average propane selling prices  coupled with an increase in retail gallons sold 
propane selling prices averaged higher in fiscal compared to the prior year as a result of steadily increasing costs of propane throughout the first half of fiscal which remained higher during the second half of the year 
retail gallons sold increased million gallons  or  to million gallons in fiscal compared to million gallons in fiscal due primarily to colder average temperatures experienced in parts of our service area  particularly during the six month peak heating season from october through march temperatures nationwide  as reported by noaa  averaged colder than normal in fiscal compared to warmer than normal temperatures in the prior year  or colder conditions year over year 
the coldest weather conditions  however  were experienced in the eastern and central regions of the united states 
in the west  average temperatures were warmer than normal during fiscal  compared to warmer than normal during the prior year 
in addition  our volumes continued to be affected by the impact of a continued economic recession on customer buying habits 
revenues from wholesale and risk management activities reported within the propane segment of million in fiscal decreased million  or  compared to revenues of million in the prior year primarily as a result of lower volumes sold in the wholesale market 
revenue from hvac sales and service activities and other revenue sources of million in fiscal decreased million  or  compared to the prior year

liquidity and capital resources analysis of cash flows operating activities 
due to the seasonal nature of the propane and fuel oil businesses  cash flows from operating activities are greater during the winter and spring seasons  our second and third fiscal quarters  as customers pay for propane purchased during the heating season 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended september  amounted to million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was attributable to the improvement in net income  as well as a decrease in net working capital investment compared to the prior year 
net working capital decreased primarily as a result of an increase in customer prepayments and deposits under our budget payment programs  particularly in our fuel oil and other refined fuels segment 
under these budget payment programs  customers pay equal monthly installments beginning in the june or july timeframe for the upcoming heating season based on each customer s historical usage patterns 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  to million  compared to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to lower net income  including lower non cash items principally depreciation  amortization and gains on asset disposals  as well as the impact of increased investment in accounts receivable and inventories resulting from higher commodity prices and increased business activity during fiscal compared to fiscal due to generally colder average temperatures 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the fiscal year ended september  consists of the net impact of the million total cost of the agway acquisition partially offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of customer service centers during fiscal and net proceeds of million from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
additionally  capital expenditures were million including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations for fiscal capital spending in fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal primarily as a result of our facility integration efforts in the northeast  as well as additional spending on information technology in connection with the integration of agway energy 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting million in capital expenditures including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of assets including net proceeds of million from the sale of nine customer service centers 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting million in capital expenditures including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of assets including net proceeds of million resulting from the sale of our propane storage facility in hattiesburg  mississippi 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was million as a result of i net proceeds of million from the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  a portion of which was used to fund a portion of the agway acquisition  and  ii net proceeds of million from a public offering of approximately million common units including full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option during december to fund a portion of the agway acquisition  offset by i the payment of a total of million for our quarterly distributions of per common unit during each of the first two quarters of fiscal  per common unit during the third quarter of fiscal and per common unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and  ii the repayment of the third annual principal installment of million due under the senior note agreement 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  reflecting i the payment of million for our quarterly distributions  ii the repayment of million constituting all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  iii the repayment of the second annual principal payment of million due under the senior note agreement  and  iv the payment of million in fees associated with the renewal and extension of our revolving credit agreement in may the million reduction in debt during fiscal was funded through a combination of cash provided by operations and the net proceeds of million from a public offering of approximately million common units including full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option during the third quarter of fiscal net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  primarily reflecting the payment of quarterly distributions 
summary of long term debt obligations and revolving credit lines on december   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with an annual interest rate of pursuant to rule a and regulation s of the securities act of on may   pursuant to a registration rights agreement  we exchanged these unregistered senior notes for million aggregate principal amount of registered senior notes  which have substantially the same terms the senior notes 
we used approximately million from the issuance of the senior notes to fund a portion of the cost of the agway acquisition and the remaining net proceeds were held for general partnership purposes  including working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt reduction 
our obligations under the senior notes are unsecured and will rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness and equally in right of payment with any future senior indebtedness 
the senior notes are structurally subordinated to  which means they rank effectively behind  the senior notes and other liabilities of the operating partnership 
the senior notes will mature on december   and require semi annual interest payments that began on june  we are permitted to redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time on or after december   at redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the senior notes the senior note agreement 
the senior note agreement contains certain restrictions applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries with respect to i the incurrence of additional indebtedness  and  ii liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
on march   pursuant to a senior note agreement the senior note agreement  our operating partnership issued million of senior notes the senior notes with an annual interest rate of 
our operating partnership s obligations under the senior note agreement are unsecured and rank on an equal and ratable basis with its obligations under the senior note agreement and the revolving credit agreement discussed below 
under the terms of the senior note agreement  our operating partnership became obligated to pay the principal on the senior notes in equal annual payments of million starting july   with the last such payment due june  on july   we received net proceeds of million from the issuance by our operating partnership of senior notes due june the senior notes and used the funds to pay the first annual principal payment of million due under the senior note agreement 
our operating partnership s obligations under the agreement governing the senior notes the senior note agreement are unsecured and rank on an equal and ratable basis with its obligations under the senior note agreement and the revolving credit agreement 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we elected to repay the second annual principal payment of million and during the fourth quarter of fiscal we repaid the third annual principal payment of million due under the senior note agreement  in each case using cash on hand 
on october   our operating partnership entered into the third amended and restated credit agreement the revolving credit agreement  which replaced the second amended and restated credit agreement  which would have expired in may the revolving credit agreement expires on october  and provides available credit of million in the form of a million revolving working capital facility  of which million may be used to issue letters of credit  and a separate million letter of credit facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate based upon either libor or wachovia national bank s prime rate  plus  in each case  the applicable margin  or the federal funds rate plus of 
an annual facility fee ranging from to  based upon certain financial tests  is payable quarterly whether or not borrowings occur 
these fees and the other terms of the revolving credit agreement are substantially the same as the terms under the second amended and restated credit agreement  which provided a million working capital facility and a million acquisition facility 
in connection with the third amended and restated credit agreement our leverage ratio was reduced from to to a requirement to maintain a ratio of less than to as a result of the change in the leverage ratio applicable to the revolving credit agreement  the leverage ratio required under the senior note agreement and the senior note agreement were also reduced to to in addition  in connection with this amendment  our operating partnership added additional financial institutions to the bank group supporting the revolving credit agreement 
as of september  and september   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
the senior note agreement  the senior note agreement and the revolving credit agreement contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to the operating partnership  including a maintenance of certain financial tests  including  but not limited to  a leverage ratio of less than to  an interest coverage ratio in excess of to and a leverage ratio of less than to when the underfunded portion of our pension obligations is used in the computation of the ratio  b restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  and c restrictions on certain liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
we were in compliance with all covenants and terms of all of our debt agreements as of september  and as of the end of each fiscal quarter for all periods presented 
partnership distributions we will make distributions in an amount equal to all of our available cash  as defined in our second amended and restated partnership agreement the partnership agreement  approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates 
our board of supervisors reviews the level of available cash on a quarterly basis based upon information provided by management 
during the first and second quarters of fiscal  we paid distributions to our common unitholders of per common unit 
on april   our board of supervisors declared a annualized increase in the quarterly distribution from per common unit to per common unit  or on an annualized basis  in respect of the second quarter of fiscal  which was paid on may  on july   our board of supervisors declared a annualized increase in the quarterly distribution from per common unit to per common unit  or on an annualized basis  in respect of the third quarter of fiscal  which was paid on august  on october   our board of supervisors declared a quarterly distribution of per common unit in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was paid on november  to holders of record on november  quarterly distributions include incentive distribution rights idrs payable to the general partner to the extent the quarterly distribution exceeds per common unit 
the idrs represent an incentive for the general partner which is owned by the management of the partnership to increase the distributions to common unitholders in excess of per common unit 
with regard to the first of the common unit distribution  of the available cash is distributed to the common unitholders and is distributed to the general partner and  respectively  prior to our december public offering 
with regard to the balance of the common unit distributions paid  of the available cash is distributed to the common unitholders and is distributed to the general partner 
pension plan assets and obligations while our pension asset portfolio experienced significantly improved asset returns in fiscal and fiscal  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan continues to be affected by the impact of the low interest rate environment on the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligations  as well as the cumulative impact of prior losses particularly during fiscal and fiscal the projected benefit obligation as of september  exceeded the market value of pension plan assets by million  which represented an improvement of million compared to the million underfunded position at the end of the prior year 
our defined benefit pension plan was frozen to new participants effective january  and  in furtherance of our effort to minimize future increases in our benefit obligations  effective january   all future service credits were eliminated 
therefore  eligible participants will receive interest credits only toward their ultimate defined benefit under the defined benefit pension plan 
during fiscal  lump sum benefit payments to either terminated or retired individuals of million exceeded the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost 
as a result  pursuant to sfas we recorded a non cash settlement charge of million in order to accelerate recognition of a portion of cumulative unrecognized losses in the defined benefit pension plan 
these unrecognized losses were previously accumulated as a reduction to partners capital cumulative reduction of million as of the end of the prior fiscal year and were being amortized to expense as part of our net periodic pension cost in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions sfas 
after recognition of the non cash settlement charge and as a result of the improvement in the funded status of the plan described above  the cumulative reduction to partners capital decreased to million on the consolidated balance sheet at september  the cumulative reduction to partners capital is attributable to the level of unrealized losses experienced on our pension assets over the past three years and represents non cash charges to our partners capital with no impact on the results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  additional pension settlement charges may be required in future periods depending on the level of lump sum benefit payments 
there were no minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plan during fiscal  or however  in an effort to proactively address our funded status  we elected to make voluntary contributions to our defined benefit pension plan of million and million during the fourth quarter of fiscal and fiscal  respectively  thus improving our funded status 
these voluntary contributions  coupled with improved asset returns in our pension asset portfolio during fiscal and fiscal  offset the negative effects on the funded status of further declines in the interest rate environment 
there can be no assurances that future declines in capital markets  or interest rates  will not have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flow 
for purposes of computing the actuarial valuation of projected benefit obligations  we reduced the discount rate assumption from as of september  to as of september  to reflect an estimate of current market expectations related to long term interest rates and the projected duration of our pension obligations 
additionally  we reduced the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption from as of september  to as of september  based on the current investment mix of our pension asset portfolio and historical asset performance 
long term debt obligations and operating lease obligations contractual obligations long term debt obligations and future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of september  are due as follows

additionally  we have standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  in support of retention levels under our casualty insurance programs and certain lease obligations  which expire periodically through april  off balance sheet arrangements operating leases we lease certain property  plant and equipment for various periods under noncancelable operating leases  including the majority of our railroad tank cars  approximately of our vehicle fleet  approximately of our customer service centers and portions of our information systems equipment 
rental expense under operating leases was million  million and million for the years ended september   september  and september   respectively 
future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of september  are presented in the immediately preceding table 
guarantees we have residual value guarantees associated with certain of our operating leases  related primarily to transportation equipment  with remaining lease periods scheduled to expire periodically through fiscal upon completion of the lease period  we guarantee that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed the guaranteed amount  or we will pay the lessor the difference 
although the fair value of equipment at the end of its lease term has historically exceeded the guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is deemed worthless at the end of the lease term  is approximately million 
of this amount  the fair value of residual value guarantees for operating leases entered into after december  is reflected in other liabilities  with a corresponding amount included within other assets  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet totaling million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in chapter of accounting research bulletin no 
 inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas requires that these types of items be recognized as current period charges as they occur 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   we were a party to exchange traded futures and option contracts  forward contracts and in certain instances  over the counter options collectively derivative instruments to manage the price risk associated with future purchases of the commodities used in our operations  principally propane and fuel oil 
futures and forward contracts require that we sell or acquire propane or fuel oil at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require  its holder to buy or sell propane or fuel oil at a specified price during a specified time period  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of the product to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then current price and the fixed contract price 
the contracts are entered into in anticipation of market movements and to manage and hedge exposure to fluctuating prices of propane and fuel oil  as well as to help ensure the availability of product during periods of high demand 
market risks associated with the trading of futures  options and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with our hedging and risk management policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
market risk we are subject to commodity price risk to the extent that propane or fuel oil market prices deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
futures traded with brokers of the nymex require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward and option contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term either by physical delivery or through a net settlement mechanism 
credit risk futures and fuel oil options are guaranteed by the nymex and  as a result  have minimal credit risk 
we are subject to credit risk with forward and option contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
we evaluate the financial condition of each counterparty with which we conduct business and establish credit limits to reduce exposure to credit risk of non performance 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we account for derivative instruments in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas 
all derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet  within other current assets or other current liabilities  at their fair values 
fair values for forward contracts and futures are derived from quoted market prices for similar instruments traded on the nymex 
on the date that futures  forward and option contracts are entered into  we make a determination as to whether the derivative instrument qualifies for designation as a hedge 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current period earnings or other comprehensive income loss oci  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if it is  the type of hedge 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we formally assess  both at the hedge contract s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in oci to the extent effective and reclassified into cost of products sold during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings 
the mark to market gains or losses on ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in cost of products sold immediately 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges are recorded in current period earnings within operating expenses 
a portion of our option contracts are not classified as hedges and  as such  changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized within operating expenses as they occur 
the value of certain option contracts that do qualify as hedges and are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas have two components of value time value and intrinsic value 
the intrinsic value is the value by which the option is in the money ie  the amount by which the value of the commodity exceeds the exercise or strike price of the option 
the remaining amount of option value is attributable to time value 
we do not include the time value of option contracts in our assessment of hedge effectiveness and  therefore  record changes in the time value component of the options currently in earnings 
at september   the fair value of derivative instruments described above resulted in derivative assets of million included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and derivative liabilities of million included within other current liabilities 
for the year ended september  operating expenses include unrealized non cash losses of million compared to unrealized non cash losses of million for the year ended september   attributable to the change in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges 
at september   unrealized gains on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in the amount of million were included in oci and are expected to be recognized in earnings during the next months as the hedged transactions occur 
however  due to the volatility of the commodities market  the corresponding value in oci is subject to change prior to its impact on earnings 
sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate our exposure to unfavorable market price changes in propane or fuel oil related to our open positions under derivative instruments  we developed a model that incorporates the following data and assumptions

c 
the market prices determined in b 
above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical change in the future periods and compared to the fixed contract settlement amounts in a 
above to project the potential negative impact on earnings that would be recognized for the respective scenario 
based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for each of the future months for which a future  forward and or option contract exists indicate a reduction in potential future gains of million as of september  the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio 
as of september   our open position portfolio reflected a net long position purchase aggregating million 
the average posted price of propane on november  at mont belvieu  texas a major storage point was cents per gallon as compared to cents per gallon on september   representing a increase 
the average posted price of fuel oil on november  at linden  new jersey was per gallon as compared to per gallon on september   representing a increase
