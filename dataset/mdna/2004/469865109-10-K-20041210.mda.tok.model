item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global producer of branded bath and plumbing products for the residential  commercial and institutional markets 
we currently operate as three business segments  consisting of the bath products segment  the plumbing products segment and the rexair segment 
our bath products segment manufactures whirlpool baths  spas  showers  sanitary ware  including sinks and toilets  and bathtubs for the construction and remodeling markets 
our plumbing products segment manufactures professional grade drainage  water control  commercial brass and pex piping products for the commercial and institutional construction  renovation and facilities maintenance markets 
our rexair segment manufactures premium vacuum cleaner systems sold through independent distributors in the direct sales retail channel 
demand for our products is primarily driven by new home starts  remodeling and commercial construction activity 
accordingly  many external factors affect our business including weather and the impact of the broader economy on our end markets 
weather is an important variable for us as it significantly impacts construction 
spring and summer months in the us and europe represent the main construction season for new housing starts and remodeling  as well as increased construction in the commercial and institutional markets 
as a result  sales in our bath products and plumbing products segments increase in our third and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the first two quarters of our fiscal year 
the autumn and winter months generally impede construction and installation activity 
housing starts  consumer spending and remodeling expenditures have a major impact on our consumer focused bath and spa businesses  which are included in our bath products segment 
our plumbing products business is dependent upon commercial and institutional construction activity and is therefore affected by macroeconomic factors such as the unemployment rate and the availability of financing 
despite the cyclical nature of the us commercial and institutional construction market  which experienced declines in revenue potential of approximately in fiscal  approximately in fiscal and a slight rebound in fiscal  sales of our commercial and institutional products have continued to grow at a rate that exceeds that of the industry 
we have achieved this growth through favorable pricing  product innovation and targeted marketing programs 
during fiscal  we initiated several plans to improve the operations of our bath products segment 
these initiatives include the downsizing of our manufacturing plant in ford city  pa  which is expected to be substantially completed by december  plans to close our manufacturing plant in tupelo  ms by june  the outsourcing of products through lower cost suppliers  the rationalization of unprofitable product lines  and the further consolidation of selling and administrative functions into our shared services center in dallas  tx 
in the first half of fiscal  we combined six separate operating facilities into one new facility in chino  ca 
additionally  we adopted a number of efficiency enhancing manufacturing techniques  including lean manufacturing  which have served to enhance our operations 
we also closed our manufacturing plants in plant city  fl and salem  oh 
the plant city plant  which manufactured spas  was closed in november the salem plant  which manufactured cast iron sanitary ware ceased production in may these restructuring initiatives are discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we continue to evaluate strategies to improve the operating results of our bath product segment 
the implementation of any additional performance improvement strategies may result in our recording impairment  restructuring and other charges in future periods 
our board of directors approved a formal disposal plan for the sale of five businesses in december the disposal plan and a formal disposal plan for the sale of three businesses in february the disposal plan 
we have completed the sale of all businesses under both disposal plans 

table of contents each of these disposal plans qualified for treatment as discontinued operations  and accordingly  are not included in our discussion of results of operations of this annual report on form k 
summarized results of the discontinued operations through the dates of sale are as follows for the fiscal years ended october  september  september  in millions net sales operating loss income the decrease in net sales and operating loss income from fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result of the lost contribution from the businesses sold in accordance with the disposal plan 
prior to their disposal dates  these businesses contributed million of net sales and million of operating income in fiscal  while only contributing million of net sales and an operating loss of million in fiscal net sales and operating loss income in fiscal also decreased from the prior year  but to a lesser extent  because of the sale of the businesses in the disposal plan 
prior to their disposal dates  these businesses contributed million of net sales and million of operating income in fiscal  while only contributing million of net sales and an operating loss of million in fiscal the only business contributing to fiscal was the water systems business  which was sold within the first month of the year 
results of operations the following table presents our results of operations by segment for the periods indicated 
certain amounts reported for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
for the fiscal years ended october  september  september  in millions net sales bath products plumbing products rexair total net sales operating income bath products plumbing products rexair corporate expenses total operating income fiscal compared to fiscal overall overall  net sales increased to billion in fiscal year as compared to fiscal the increase reflects strong sales in our bath products and plumbing products segments 
fiscal results include million in sales recognized upon the granting of a license for certain technology that had been the subject of patent litigation 
operating income increased million or in fiscal when compared to fiscal primarily due to strong operating results in our bath products segment 
included in 
table of contents our fiscal results are million of restructuring charges  while fiscal results included million of restructuring charges  of which million was included in cost of products sold 
bath products net sales in our bath products segment increased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was the primarily the result of continued growth in the domestic spa and bath businesses  due to an expanded specialty retailer base  as well as growth in the european bath and sink businesses  which was primarily the result of continued higher sales to the home center channel 
fiscal sales also included a million benefit from favorable currency exchange rates mainly due to the firming of the british pound and the euro against the us dollar 
sales growth in fiscal was partially offset by a decrease in sales at eljer  as a result of the rationalization of unprofitable product lines 
operating income of million for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal  due primarily to strong sales and margin growth in the domestic spa and whirlpool bath businesses 
gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales mainly due to increased volume over fixed overhead and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
these efficiencies were experienced segment wide  but especially in the new chino  ca plant which became operational in fiscal strong earnings growth was accomplished despite an increase in restructuring charges from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements 
fiscal was also impacted by a million write off of accounts receivable associated with the bankruptcy of a domestic distributor  a million increase in our bad debt reserves associated with financial difficulties encountered by several brazilian bath product distributors and million in severance related to staffing reductions in brazil 
in fiscal  we also established a million bad debt reserve against a receivable from one of the same brazilian distributors 
we have since taken over sales responsibility for the brazilian home center channel  and expect this action to result in improved sales  margins and customer service for this segment as we are now directly in control of sales into this channel 
operating income in fiscal was negatively impacted by the aforementioned restructuring charges as well as labor inefficiencies and start up costs related to the move to a new whirlpool bath manufacturing facility in chino  ca  costs of process improvements to enhance quality and future operating efficiencies at the new chino  ca plant  costs related to the lowe s roll out  increased marketing expenses and escalating costs associated with our cast iron and sanitary ware businesses 
favorable currency exchange rates improved earnings in fiscal when compared to fiscal by million 
plumbing products net sales in the plumbing products segment increased million or in fiscal when compared with fiscal sales in fiscal increased as a result of continued market penetration particularly in the pex and commercial brass product lines 
sales in these product lines were driven by superior sensor technology and the market s continued conversion of copper pipe to pex tubing in plumbing applications 
fiscal sales included million from the sale of a license for technology that had been the subject of patent litigation 
operating income decreased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal excluding the million gain on the sale of the technology license in fiscal  operating income increased in fiscal as a result of improved sales and favorable pricing  which helped to offset higher scrap iron and steel costs 
we implemented initiatives targeting procurement and finished product pricing to offset the increased raw material costs 
we began realizing the benefits of these procurement and pricing initiatives in the latter half of fiscal rexair net sales increased million or in fiscal as compared with the previous fiscal year 
the increase was due to the higher price points of the new e rainbow tm vacuum cleaner system  which was launched earlier this year 
the rollout of the new e model was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents operating income in fiscal increased million or when compared with fiscal fiscal operating income was negatively impacted by million in costs associated with the aforementioned launch of the new e model 
the year over year comparison was also impacted by an inventory reduction program implemented in fiscal that negatively impacted operating income by approximately million that year 
corporate expenses corporate expenses increased million in fiscal as compared to last year 
the increase was attributable to reductions in pension income due to a lower discount rate  costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  an increase in consulting fees and an increase in personnel costs reflecting our new operating company organization 
fiscal also includes charges and amortization totaling million associated with an employee stock option buy back and exchange offer 
corporate expenses in fiscal include million of restructuring charges associated with the consolidation of our corporate offices  net of a favorable adjustment reversing previously established reserves for vacant leased space now occupied by the shared services center in dallas  tx 
fiscal also includes a reversal of the restructuring reserve for unused leased space of million associated with space that will be used by the customer service function that was relocated to the shared services operations center 
interest income and expense the decrease in interest expense of million from fiscal to fiscal was due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates realized as a result of the july refinancing and the june bank amendment 
the increase in interest income in fiscal was due to million of interest received from the irs related to a prior year audit settlement 
other expense  net other expense  net was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal included in other expense  net for both years are expenses associated with retained liabilities of our ladder operations  which was sold in october fiscal also includes foreign currency transaction losses and a loss for the decrease in the value of the polyaire call option see note of our consolidated financial statements offset by a gain of million resulting from the resolution of litigation that was under appeal for several years 
fiscal includes million of charges associated with the refinancing of our debt facilities in july  a gain on the sale of real estate of million and million of other financing charges related to our debt facilities 
taxes during the first quarter of fiscal  we had an initial meeting with the internal revenue service irs to begin their audit for the fiscal years through the irs is currently at the information gathering stage of the audit process and has not communicated any areas of concern or proposed adjustments 
the irs anticipates completing their audit in june in addition  several states and various other countries have examinations either in the planning stages or currently underway and one of our subsidiaries is also under audit by the irs for and  a period prior to our acquisition of that subsidiary 
during fiscal  the irs completed its examination of the federal income tax returns for fiscal through as a result of the audit settlement  a tax benefit of million was recorded in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal overall overall  net sales increased million or in fiscal year when compared to fiscal the results reflect sales increases in each of our operating segments  with the most significant increases achieved in our bath products segment 
fiscal results include million in sales recognized upon the 
table of contents granting of a license for certain technology that had been the subject of patent litigation 
operating income decreased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal included in our fiscal results are million of impairment  restructuring and other charges  of which million is included in cost of products sold  while our fiscal results include restructuring and other charges of million 
for detailed information on these charges see our discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in operating income  beyond the net impact of the impairment  restructuring and other charges  is primarily due to a decrease in operating results in our bath products segment as more fully described below 
bath products net sales in our bath products segment increased by million or in fiscal as compared with fiscal approximately million of the increase or was due to the firming of the british pound and the euro against the us dollar 
the remaining increase was primarily the result of increased sales of our bath products in the uk and our spas in the us in addition to the introduction of our jacuzzi whirlpool bath product lines into the nearly lowe s home centers in the us the increase in the sales for us bath products was primarily attributable to additional sales to focus and homebase  two leading uk homecenter retailers 
the increase in sales of our domestic spas was the result of strong sales and marketing efforts and an expanded specialty retail dealer base 
operating income of million for fiscal includes million of restructuring and other charges primarily related to the closure of two plants  while operating income of million for fiscal includes million of restructuring and other charges related to the elimination of an executive layer of management 
a separate discussion of these charges can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
excluding these charges  operating income decreased as favorable sales volume was offset by labor inefficiencies and start up costs related to the move to a new whirlpool bath manufacturing facility in chino  ca  costs of process improvements to enhance quality and future operating efficiencies at the new chino  ca plant  costs related to the lowe s roll out  higher insurance costs  increased marketing expenses and escalating costs associated with our cast iron and sanitary ware businesses 
in addition  we established a million reserve against a receivable from a brazilian distributor in fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  as amended 
favorable currency exchange rates improved earnings by million for fiscal plumbing products net sales in the plumbing products segment increased by million or for fiscal when compared with fiscal fiscal includes million from the sale of a license for technology that had been the subject of patent litigation 
without these revenues  sales still remained ahead of despite continued softness in the us commercial and institutional construction markets  which declined by approximately in fiscal this was accomplished by enhancing product offerings and implementing programs to increase market share 
operating income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal results include restructuring and other charges of million related to a management restructuring and discontinued product lines see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the increase in operating income  after giving effect for the restructuring and other charges in fiscal  is the result of higher sales and the million sale of the technology license 
without the sale of the license  margins as a percentage of sales would have decreased slightly primarily as a result of changes in the product mix sold 
rexair net sales increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was the result of higher volume and a price increase implemented at the beginning of fiscal 
table of contents operating income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal increased margins from the increase in sales were offset by decreased overhead absorption of approximately million related to an inventory reduction program and increased compensation costs in fiscal and a decrease in estimated warranty reserves during that increased operating income that year 
corporate expenses corporate expenses increased by million in fiscal as compared with fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to net restructuring charges in fiscal of million related to the consolidation of corporate offices and a favorable adjustment to prior year reserves related to a corporate lease obligation 
fiscal includes restructuring charges of million related to the same corporate lease obligation see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we increased the reserve in fiscal when it became apparent that we could not sub lease the empty space 
a portion of the reserve was reversed when we decided to utilize the space for the shared services operations center 
the remaining increase  after giving effect to the net restructuring charges  is primarily due to a decrease in pension income  reflecting a reduction in the discount rate used in valuing the plans 
partially offsetting these increased costs are decreases in compensation and other personnel related expenses due to staffing reductions as well as decreases in professional fees 
interest income and expense the decrease in interest expense of million from fiscal to fiscal was largely due to lower debt balances resulting from asset disposals  the proceeds of which were used for the repayment of debt 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal was primarily due to the january sale of million in aggregate principal amount of strategic notes 
other expense  net other expense  net was million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal fiscal includes million of charges associated with the refinancing of our debt facilities in july  million in expenses associated with retained liabilities of our ladder operations which were sold in october and million of other financing charges related to our debt facilities 
fiscal includes million in financing related charges and million in expenses associated with our ladder operations 
taxes during fiscal  the irs completed its examination of the federal income tax returns for fiscal through as a result of the audit settlement  a tax benefit of million was recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of million  which was largely attributable to benefits realized as the result of certain asset sales and changes in tax laws regarding the utilization of loss carry backs 
we are able to carry back net operating losses in fiscal for which we had previously established a valuation allowance in fiscal as a result of a change in tax law under the job creation and worker s assistance act of in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  the release of a valuation allowance due to a change in tax law is reflected through continuing operations 
we had established the valuation allowance in fiscal to reflect the uncertainty of the future realization of losses recognized in connection with the disposal plan see note to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash and cash equivalents  cash provided from operations and available borrowings 
we expect to satisfy operating needs including the cash requirements 
table of contents related to our capital expenditures and restructuring programs through operating cash flows and borrowings under our existing bank facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the difference between and was primarily because fiscal activity included a million receipt of income tax refunds  net of tax payments  and million resulting from a technology sale  offset by payments of liabilities we had previously accrued related to retained liabilities for operations we had sold during that year 
we typically use cash in the first half of the fiscal year due to the seasonality of most of our businesses 
weather can significantly impact construction and installation  which ultimately impacts sales in our bath products and plumbing products segments 
sales of outdoor jetted spas and other products are also sensitive to weather conditions and tend to decrease during the fall and winter months predominantly the first and second fiscal quarters 
inventories at fiscal year end increased by million  or  over fiscal inventory levels have increased in all three of our business segments 
the increase in our bath products segment was due to sales growth in fiscal and the transition to sourced inventory products as a result of closing the salem  oh plant and downsizing the ford city  pa facility 
inventory levels increased year over year in our plumbing products segment primarily as a result of business growth and an increase in materials cost 
inventory levels were up in our rexair segment as compared to fiscal due to the higher costs of parts for the new e rainbow tm vacuum cleaner system 
in addition  rexair inventory levels were lower at the end of fiscal in anticipation of the launch of the new e model 
trade accounts receivable  net increased million in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase was mainly due to sales growth  as days of sales outstanding remained relatively flat year over year 
during fiscal  we paid approximately million related to our restructuring plans  and expect to pay approximately million in the next months see note to our consolidated financial statements including million of charges to be incurred during fiscal during fiscal  we paid approximately million related to our restructuring plans 
net cash used by discontinued operations in fiscal was million as compared to net cash used of million in fiscal the net cash used in fiscal pertained to the operations of our water systems business  which was sold in october in addition  the swimming pool and equipment business was sold in may  before its cash generating season 
net cash used by investing activities of million in fiscal included million received from sold businesses of which approximately million related to the sale of our water systems business in october  and million related to payments received in connection with the sale of our swimming pool and equipment business in may we also received million from collection of a portion of a note we held from the owners of a power plant constructed by one of our former subsidiaries  as well as million from the sale of excess real estate and fixed assets 
these receipts were offset by million paid for capital expenditures 
net cash provided by investing activities of million for fiscal consisted of net proceeds of million from the sale of siteco and our swimming pool and equipment business and million from the sale of excess real estate  partially offset by million of capital expenditures 
we expect total capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately million for new business requirements  system upgrades and implementations  initiatives involving the consolidation of workflows and improvement of manufacturing efficiencies and other capital requirements in the ordinary course of business 
net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal we repaid million of our debt  including a million permanent reduction of our term loan

table of contents million of withdrawals from the restricted cash collateral accounts  the establishment and depletion of which was prescribed by the terms of our then outstanding bank facilities 
the debt issuance and other financing costs were comprised of bank amendment fees  legal and professional fees  consent fees  debt issuance costs  financing costs and bond redemption fees 
these costs were associated with the fiscal reorganization of our debt structure  including the payoff and redemption of our then existing bank debt and senior notes 
on july   we completed a comprehensive re financing of our corporate debt by closing on the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes the senior notes  as well as a new five year million asset based revolving credit facility and a five year million term loan collectively the bank facilities 
the net proceeds from the senior notes together with the initial borrowings under the bank facilities were used to repay debt and redeem the senior notes that were outstanding at that time 
on june   we amended our bank facilities  and on july   we made a million payment to the bank permanently reducing our term loan to million 
the amendment provides for a reduction in the interest rate of our term loan from prime plus  with a minimum rate of  to libor plus  with no minimum rate  the elimination of annual prepayments on the term loan of million  which were scheduled to begin in august  the elimination of annual prepayments on the term loan equal to of our annual consolidated excess cash flow  as determined by the original loan agreement  the extension of the term loan s maturity date by one year to july   and the elimination of all debt covenants except the requirement to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
this requirement is applicable only if our availability under the asset based credit facility falls below million 
this amendment was not considered a substantial modification of our debt under the guidance provided in eitf issue no 
 debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 
the outstanding debt balances and the maximum availability under these debt instruments at october  were as follows maximum amount availability outstanding applicable interest rate senior notes asset based credit facility over libor or over prime term loan over libor us brass note interest imputed at total in addition  million of the facility is utilized for letters of credit at the end of fiscal the net cash proceeds from the senior notes were approximately million after transaction fees 
transaction fees were capitalized and are being amortized over the seven year term of the senior notes 
the senior notes  which are due july  and require the payment of interest of million on january and july of each year  were subject to registration with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to a registration rights agreement 
on february   we completed an offer to exchange new  registered senior notes for the then outstanding unregistered notes 
the terms of the new  registered senior notes are identical  in all material respects  to the terms of the then outstanding unregistered notes  except that the new senior notes have been registered under the securities act  and the transfer restrictions and registration rights relating to the unregistered notes do not apply to the registered senior notes 

table of contents we are restricted in the redemption of the senior notes per the terms of the agreement with the note holders the agreement 
prior to july   we can redeem up to of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of an equity offering  as defined in the agreement 
on and after july   we can redeem the senior notes subject to a redemption premium of for the first months and for the following months 
on and after july   the senior notes can be redeemed at face value 
the five year asset based revolving credit facility matures on july  under this facility  we can borrow up to million subject to a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory  plus eligible trademarks 
the initial amount of eligible trademarks of million is being amortized monthly over the first two years of the facility as a reduction of the borrowing base 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the asset based credit facility was for fiscal there are several fees associated with the asset based credit facility including an unused commitment fee of  a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable libor margin and a fronting fee of on all outstanding letters of credit 
the bank facilities contain a subjective acceleration clause and a requirement to maintain a lockbox associated with our asset based facility 
as required by eitf issue no 
 balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lockbox arrangement  the entire balance of the asset based facility is included in current maturities of long term debt 
we incurred approximately million in transaction and professional fees associated with the completion of the bank facilities deal in fiscal these costs were capitalized  and a portion is being amortized over the five year term of the asset based credit facility  and a portion is being amortized over the six year term of the term loan 
the bank facilities require us to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  which is only applicable if our availability under the asset based credit facility falls below million 
we were not subject to this debt covenant at october  because our availability exceeded the required threshold 
we expect to maintain availability in excess of million for the foreseeable future 
our bank facilities also include a restriction on the payment of dividends 
certain of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries guarantee the senior notes  jointly and severally  on a senior basis 
the senior notes are secured by an eligible first lien on domestic property  plant and equipment  and a second lien on the assets that secure the bank facilities 
the asset based credit facility is secured by a first lien on accounts receivable  inventory  intangibles  the stock of our domestic subsidiaries and of the stock of our first tier foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  the asset based credit facility has a second lien on the property  plant and equipment securing the senior notes 
the term loan is secured by the same assets that secure the asset based credit facility  but the term loan will be paid on a last out basis following the payment of the obligations under the asset based credit facility 
the continued decrease in total debt combined with increased earnings continues to move us closer towards our goal of achieving investment grade ratios 
the reduction in leverage along with investment grade ratios will support the objective of improved borrowing rates leading to lower interest costs over time 
on november   the interest rate on our asset based revolving credit facility was lowered from libor plus to libor plus as a result of a decrease in our leverage ratio 
commitments at october   we had approximately million available to be borrowed under the asset based facility  of which we had utilized approximately million including million of letters of credit  leaving million available for additional borrowings

these amounts have not been discounted 
new accounting pronouncement in november  fasb statement no

 chapter sfas no 
 was issued 
the amendments made by sfas no 
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will become effective for us beginning in fiscal we are in the process of assessing the impact sfas no 
will have on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents foreign currency matters the functional currency of each of our foreign operations is the local currency 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates  while net sales  expenses and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as a component of stockholders equity 
effects of inflation because of the relatively low level of inflation experienced in most of our principal markets  inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations during the periods presented 
although higher than normal inflation in fiscal resulted in increased scrap iron and steel costs used in the production of certain of our products  we were able to offset those increases with more favorable pricing of those products 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
our accounting policies can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
below is a discussion of the policies that we believe may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
trade receivables we record an allowance for doubtful accounts  reducing our receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from our customers 
we use significant judgment in estimating uncollectible amounts  considering numerous factors such as current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and current customer performance and customer relationships 
although we consider our allowances for uncollectible accounts to be adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions or customer circumstances could have a material effect on the reserve balances required 
historically  actual results have not deviated significantly from those previously estimated by management 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
we review our inventory balances to determine if inventories can be sold at amounts equal to or greater than their recorded values 
the review includes the identification of slow moving inventories  obsolete inventories and discontinued products based on the historical performance of the inventories and current operational plans for inventories  as well as estimated future customer demand for the inventories 
historically  actual results have not deviated significantly from those previously estimated by management 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current law  of any temporary differences in the timing of when net sales and expenses are recognized for tax purposes and when they are recognized for financial statement purposes 
management reviews the deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided as necessary 
we consider expected future income and gains from investments as well as tax planning strategies  including the potential sale of certain assets  in 
table of contents assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
if future taxable income is different than expected  we may need to change our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluation of our tax provisions 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we estimate tax exposures and establish accruals when in our judgment we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale we record reserves for the difference between the carrying value and the net realizable value of our net assets held for sale 
these reserves require that management make assumptions about estimated proceeds  based on the demand for these assets and current market conditions  and about estimated costs to sell  based on management s professional knowledge and experience 
we monitor these reserves on an on going basis and record adjustments to our estimates based on actual results and management s updated knowledge 
assets held for sale have been evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

goodwill and other intangibles we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy  reporting unit operating results and or market conditions could significantly impact our judgment and could require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
 we test our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or earlier in the year if indications of impairment arise 
we test our finite lived intangible assets for impairment when there are indicators of impairment as defined in sfas no 
the results of any of these tests could require adjustments to recorded asset balances in future periods 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities in establishing accruals for restructuring costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we measure our liability at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in estimating the fair value of expected exit and disposal costs  we make certain assumptions to determine the remaining lease obligations  sublease income  severance costs  relocation costs and other exit costs 
while we feel our assumptions are appropriate  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not differ from estimates used to establish the restructuring reserves 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we may need to adjust  upward or downward  our restructuring reserves in the future 
additionally  long lived assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 which involves the use of estimates to calculate fair value  future cash flows and costs to sell 
these estimates may differ from actual amounts realized in future periods 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
we determine the amount of reserves needed  if any  for each individual issue based on our professional knowledge and experience and discussions with legal counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter  the ultimate resolution of each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy  in dealing with these matters 
we have sold a number of assets and businesses over the last several years and have  on occasion  provided indemnification for liabilities relating to product liability  environmental and other claims 
we have recorded reserves for claims related to these obligations when appropriate and  on certain occasions  have 
table of contents obtained the assistance of an independent actuary in the determination of those reserves 
if actual experience deviates from our estimates  we may need to record adjustments to these liabilities in future periods 
our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
we record self insurance accruals based on our estimates of the fully developed cost of claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported are developed by us with the help of an independent actuary 
if actual experience of claims development is significantly different than our estimates  an adjustment to our self insurance accruals may need to be recorded in future periods 
warranty reserves reserves are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets to reflect our contractual liabilities relating to warranty commitments to our customers 
we provide warranty coverage of various lengths and terms to our customers depending on standard offerings and negotiated contractual agreements 
we record an estimate for warranty expense at the time of sale based on historical warranty return rates and repair costs 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which these additional reserves are required 
pension and other post employment benefits we have significant pension and post retirement benefit income and expense and assets liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
these valuations include key assumptions regarding discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  merit and promotion increases and the current health care cost trend rate 
we consider current market conditions in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit income costs or assets liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions and changes in asset values 
when valuing the pension plans at the end of fiscal  we reduced our discount rate by basis points for our domestic plan and increased the life expectancy assumptions on our uk plan 
also influencing the expected expense of approximately million in fiscal in comparison to the pension income of million in fiscal are increases in the amortization of prior year losses 
future changes in the assumptions underlying our pension valuations  including those that arise as a result of continued declines in equity markets and interest rates  could result in further reductions in pension income  which could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations in future periods 
we recognized million  million and million of pension income in fiscal  and  respectively 
these amounts increased our operating income by an equal amount for each of the respective periods 
pension income  excluding service costs  related to our master plan is included as a reduction to corporate expenses 
our master plan covers certain employees in each of our three segments and our corporate office  as well as certain employees in some of our legacy companies 
the service cost portion of pension income associated with our master plan is allocated to the operating segments and corporate based on employee data 
pension income or expense associated with our other post employment benefit plans are recorded on the books of the business that employs the benefited employees and are not shared between operating segments 
environmental liabilities we accrue an estimated liability for each environmental matter when the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss associated with such unfavorable outcome is reasonably estimable 
we presume that a matter is probable of an unfavorable outcome if a litigation has commenced or a claim has been asserted or if commencement of litigation or assertion of a claim is probable and b if we are somehow associated with the site 
in addition  if the reporting entity has been named as a potentially responsible party prp  an unfavorable outcome is presumed 

table of contents estimating environmental remediation liabilities involves an array of issues at any point in time 
in the early stages of the process  cost estimates can be difficult to derive because of uncertainties about a variety of factors 
for this reason  estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly  and  in many cases  early estimates later require significant revision 
the following are some of the factors that are integral to developing cost estimates the extent and types of hazardous substances at a site  the range of technologies that can be used for remediation  evolving standards of what constitutes acceptable remediation  and the number and financial condition of other prps and the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
an estimate of the range of an environmental remediation liability typically is derived by combining estimates of various components of the liability  which themselves are likely to be ranges 
at the early stages of the remediation process  particular components of the overall liability may not be reasonably estimable 
this fact does not preclude our recognition of a liability 
rather  the components of the liability that can be reasonably estimated are viewed as a surrogate for the minimum in the range of our overall liability 
estimated legal and consulting fees are included as a component of our overall liability 
certain environmental contamination treatment costs are capitalized in accordance with eitf issue no 
 capitalization of costs to treat environmental contamination  while most of them are charged to expense when they are incurred 
if the costs are recoverable  they are capitalized only if one of following criteria is met the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of property owned 
the condition of that property after the costs are incurred must be improved as compared with the condition of that property when originally constructed or acquired 
the costs mitigate or prevent environmental contamination that has yet to occur and that otherwise may result from future operations or activities 
in addition  the costs improve the property compared with its condition when constructed or acquired 
the costs are incurred in preparing for sale that property which is currently held for sale 
asbestos claims and insurance for asbestos claims as noted in item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k  zurn records a liability for pending and potential future asbestos claims  as well as a receivable for insurance coverage of such liability 
the valuation of zurn s potential asbestos liability  which was performed this year by an independent economic consulting firm with substantial experience in asbestos liability valuations  was based on the number and severity of future asbestos claims  future settlement costs  and the effectiveness of zurn s defense strategies and settlement initiatives 
zurn s present estimate of its asbestos liability assumes i its continuous vigorous defense strategy will remain effective  ii new asbestos claims filed annually against it will decline modestly through  iii the values by disease will remain consistent with past experience and iv its insurers will continue to pay defense costs without eroding the coverage amounts of its insurance policies 
zurn s potential asbestos liability could be adversely affected by changes in law and other factors beyond its control 
further  while zurn s current asbestos liability is based on an estimate of claims through  such liability may continue beyond  and such liability could be substantial 
zurn estimates that its available insurance to cover its potential asbestos liability as of the end of fiscal is greater than its potential asbestos liability 
this conclusion was reached after considering zurn s experience in asbestos litigation  the insurance payments made to date by zurn s insurance carriers  existing insurance policies  the industry ratings of the insurers and the advice of insurance coverage counsel with respect to applicable insurance coverage law relating to the terms and conditions of those policies 
zurn used 
table of contents these same considerations when evaluating the recoverability of its receivable for insurance coverage of potential asbestos claims 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and we have no remaining obligations  prices are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we make shipments to approved customers based on orders placed 
prices are fixed when the customer places the order 
an approved customer is one that has been subjected to our credit evaluation 
we record revenue when title passes  which is either at the time of shipment or upon delivery to the customer 
the passage of title is dependent on the arrangements made with each customer 
provisions are made for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale 
we use significant judgment in estimating sales return costs  considering numerous factors such as current overall and industry specific economic conditions and historical sales return rates 
although we consider our sales return reserves to be adequate and proper  changes in historical customer patterns could require adjustments to the reserves 
historically  however  actual results have not deviated significantly from those previously estimated by management 
we also record reductions to our revenues for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
accounting for stock based compensation fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no

we are permitted to account for such transactions under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which defines an intrinsic value method of accounting for the issuance of stock options and other equity instruments  but are required to disclose in a note to our consolidated financial statements pro forma net income and per share amounts as if we had applied the methods prescribed by sfas no 
for purposes of the pro forma disclosure  we calculate the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
to use this model  we must judgmentally determine the estimated life of the stock option  the projected volatility of our company stock over the estimated life of the stock option  the projected dividend yield of our company stock over the estimated life of the stock option and the risk free interest rate

discontinued operations effective october   we adopted sfas  no 
 which establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb no 

our disposal plan was accounted for in accordance with apb no 
 while our disposal plan was accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
both of these accounting standards contain criteria that must be met in order for businesses to be presented as discontinued operations 
in connection with our accounting for each of these disposal plans  we segregated the assets  liabilities and operations of the discontinued businesses 
the operations are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
the assets and liabilities of these businesses are included in assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale in the balance sheets 
in fiscal  we accrued for 
table of contents estimated losses during the disposal phase for businesses included in the disposal plan in accordance with apb no 
these estimates were updated as circumstances changed or as additional information became available such as the actual terms of the sales transactions 
revenues and expenses associated with businesses included in the disposal plan are included in discontinued operations when earned or incurred  respectively in accordance with sfas no

fin 
management s judgment  and in many cases  probability weighted projected cash flows are used in determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary 
we have completed an evaluation of our variable interests and believe that we do not have any interests in any vies 
however  even after exhaustive efforts  we have been unable to obtain information from woodlands ventures  llc  a property developer from whom we obtained a million note receivable upon the sale of a piece of property in october  that would allow us to assess whether the entity is a vie 
we will continue to make exhaustive efforts to obtain the information necessary to complete our evaluation 
disclosure concerning forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results in december  the private securities litigation reform act of the act was enacted by the us congress 
the act  as amended  contains certain amendments to the securities act of and the securities exchange act of these amendments provide protection from liability in private lawsuits for forward looking statements made by public companies 
we take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
our annual report on form k and the letter of the chairman and chief executive officer included in our annual report to stockholders contains both historical information and other information that may be used to infer future performance 
examples of historical information include our annual financial statements and the commentary on past performance contained in the md a 
while we have specifically identified certain information as being forward looking in the context of its presentation  we caution the reader that  with the exception of information that is clearly historical  all the information contained in this annual report on form k and the letter of the chairman and chief executive officer included in the report to stockholders should be considered to be forward looking statements as referred to in the act 
without limitation  when we use the words believe  estimate  plan  expect  intend  anticipate  continue  project  probably  should  and similar expressions  we intend to clearly express that the information deals with possible future events and is forward looking in nature 
the following are some of the factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results we have substantial indebtedness and servicing our indebtedness could reduce funds available to operate our business 
our debt instruments contain covenants which will limit our ability to operate our business 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
the seasonality of our sales and economic events may adversely affect our financial results and our ability to service our debt 
weather could adversely affect the demand for our products and decrease our net sales 
demand for building and home improvement products may depend on availability of financing 

table of contents we may be adversely affected by downturns in the markets we serve 
the markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive 
the loss of any significant customer could adversely affect our business 
an increase in the price of raw materials  components  finished goods and other commodities could adversely affect our operations 
we are exposed to political  economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 
we are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks 
we are subject to numerous asbestos claims that could adversely affect us 
we are subject to environmental regulation and incur costs relating to environmental matters 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights 
our failure to attract and retain qualified resources could have an adverse effect on us 
work stoppages and other labor problems could affect us 
other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect results

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to limit the risks from such fluctuations  we may enter into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies  but we do not engage in such transactions for trading purposes 
to manage exposure to interest rate movements  we have used interest rate protection agreements 
however  as of october   we do not have any such agreements outstanding 
based on our overall exposure to interest rate changes  a hypothetical increase of basis points across all maturities of our floating rate debt obligations would decrease our estimated pre tax earnings in fiscal by million  compared to a million decrease in fiscal pre tax earnings had libor rates been basis points higher 
net payments under swap agreements amounted to approximately million for fiscal there were no swap agreements outstanding during any portion of fiscal or fiscal the fiscal swaps were of notional amounts and maturities that related to specific portions of outstanding debt  and accordingly  were accounted for as hedge transactions 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our international operations as well as our us businesses  which import or export goods 
we have made limited use of financial instruments to manage this risk and have no such instruments outstanding as of september hypothetical unfavorable movements of across each of the foreign exchange rates from which we have exposure would have decreased our estimated income from continuing operations by approximately million  before taxes  in fiscal and million  before taxes  in fiscal this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices
