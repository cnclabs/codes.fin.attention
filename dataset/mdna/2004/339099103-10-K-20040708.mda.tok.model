overview fleetwood is the nation s leader in producing recreational vehicles  including motor homes  travel trailers and folding trailers  as well as one of the nation s leading producers of producing manufactured housing 
we are also the third largest retailer of manufactured homes in the united states 
the rv group sold  and  recreational vehicles in fiscal and  respectively 
in calendar  we had an percent share of the overall recreational vehicle retail market  consisting of a percent share of the motor home market  a percent share of the travel trailer market and a percent share of the folding trailer market 
the housing group produced and shipped  and  manufactured homes in fiscal and  respectively  and was the second largest producer of hud code homes in the united states in terms of units sold 
in calendar  we had a percent share of the manufactured housing retail market through our subsidiary  fleetwood retail corp 
the financial services group completes our vertically integrated housing operations by offering finance and insurance products to our retail customers through our subsidiary  homeone credit corp 
the supply group operates four supply companies that provide components for our manufactured housing and recreational vehicle operations  while also generating outside sales 
our business began in producing travel trailers and quickly evolved to manufactured homes 
we re entered the recreational vehicle business with the acquisition of a travel trailer operation in our manufacturing activities are conducted in states within the us  and to a much lesser extent in canada 
we distribute our manufactured products primarily through a network of independent dealers throughout the united states and canada 
in fiscal  we entered the manufactured housing retail business through a combination of key acquisitions and internal development of new retail sales centers 
at the end of fiscal  we operated retail sales locations in states 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and use historical experience factors and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe reflect our more significant judgments and estimates  and that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition revenue for manufacturing operations is generally recorded when all of the following conditions have been met an order for a product has been received from a dealer  written or verbal approval for payment has been received from the dealer s flooring institution  a common carrier signs the delivery ticket accepting responsibility for the product as agent for the dealer  and the product is removed from fleetwood s property for delivery to the dealer who placed the order 
most manufacturing sales are made on cash terms  with most dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 
products are not ordinarily sold on consignment  dealers do not ordinarily have the right to return products  and dealers are typically responsible for interest costs to floorplan lenders 
on average  we receive payments from floorplan lenders on products sold to independent dealers within days of the invoice date 
for retail sales from company owned retail stores  sales revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered  set up and accepted by the consumer  risk of ownership has been transferred and funds have been received either from the finance company or the homebuyer 
warranty fleetwood provides customers of our products with a warranty covering defects in material or workmanship for periods ranging from one to two years  with longer warranties on certain structural components 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold to customers  the average cost incurred to repair a unit and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for health benefit  workers compensation  products liability and personal injury insurance 
under these plans  liabilities are recognized for claims incurred including those incurred but not reported  changes in the reserves related to prior claims and an administration fee 
at the time a claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is guided by state statute 
factors considered in establishing the estimated liability for products liability and personal injury claims are the nature of the claim  the geographical region in which the claim originated  loss history  severity of the claim  the professional judgment of our legal counsel  and inflation 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
we are required to record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we historically have considered all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income and recent financial performance 
since we have had cumulative losses in recent years  the accounting guidance suggests that we should not look to future earnings to support the realizability of the net deferred tax asset 
as a result  we concluded that a partial valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset was appropriate 
accordingly  in fiscal year  the deferred tax asset was reduced by million to million with a corresponding adjustment to the provision for income taxes 
the book value of the net deferred tax asset was supported by the availability of various tax strategies which  if executed  were expected to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the remaining asset 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that available tax strategies were sufficient to support a deferred tax asset of million and we recorded an adjustment to the provision for income taxes of million with a corresponding reduction to the asset 
the primary reason for this reduction was an increase in the market value of our convertible preferred securities of fleetwood capital trust i 
an improved overall financial condition combined with upward movement in our stock price has contributed to a lower discount from par value and has diminished the magnitude of unrealized taxable gains in these securities 
we continue to believe that the combination of all positive and negative factors will enable us to realize the full value of the deferred tax assets  however  it is possible that the extent and availability of tax planning strategies will change over time and impact this evaluation 
one potentially beneficial development is that both the house and senate have initially passed legislation that would allow a carryback of the company s million net operating loss generated in the prior fiscal years 
if the legislation becomes law without any significant change in the relevant provisions  the utilization of this net operating loss would generate a current federal refund of approximately million 
this along with any other aspects of the new law could result in an income statement benefit through a reduction in the required valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset 
if  after future assessments of the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we determine an adjustment is required  we would record the provision or benefit in the period of such determination 
legal proceedings we are regularly involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business 
because of the uncertainties related to the outcome of the litigation and range of loss on cases other than breach of warranty  we are generally unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
in other cases  including products liability discussed above and personal injury cases  we prepare estimates based on historical experience  the professional judgment of our legal counsel  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions and any actual liability that greatly exceeds our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
repurchase commitments producers of recreational vehicles and manufactured housing customarily enter into repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floorplan financing to independent dealers 
our agreements generally provide that  in the event of a default by a dealer in its obligation to these credit sources  we will repurchase product 
with most repurchase agreements  our obligation ceases when the amount for which we are contingently liable to the lending institution has been outstanding for more than  or months  depending on the terms of the agreement 
the contingent liability under these agreements approximates the outstanding principal balance owed by the dealer for units subject to the repurchase agreement less any scheduled principal payments waived by the lender 
although the maximum potential contingent repurchase liability approximated million for inventory at manufactured housing dealers and million for inventory at rv dealers as of april   the risk of loss is reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase  and is spread over numerous dealers and financial institutions 
the gross repurchase obligation will vary depending on the season and the level of dealer inventories 
typically  the fiscal third quarter repurchase obligation will be greater than other periods due to high dealer inventories 
the rv repurchase obligation is significantly more than the manufactured housing obligation due to a higher average cost per motor home and more units in dealer inventories 
past losses under these agreements have not been significant and lender repurchase demands have been funded out of working capital 
in the past three fiscal years we have had the following repurchase activity amounts in millions  except units units repurchase amount loss recognized business outlook the combination of an improved rv market and positive acceptance of our new motor home products has been reflected in increased market share and higher production rates  resulting in significantly improved motor home earnings compared with the past two years 
the travel trailer division introduced new products covering percent of its model line up at the national trade show in december the new products were well received  as evidenced by the double digit percentage sales growth since introduction 
however  due to the breadth of change in terms of the number of models  content and resulting complexities  the impact of the new products on manufacturing efficiencies negatively affected the operating results in the last half of fiscal year and in fiscal we anticipate more normalized operational efficiencies in the future 
we expect the strong rv market to continue in fiscal however  increasing interest rates  high gas prices and global tensions may impact consumer confidence and curtail recent growth trends 
conditions in the manufactured housing market have been in decline since  and further deteriorated in calendar year competition from repossessed homes  more stringent lending standards  relatively high retail interest rates for manufactured housing and the shortage of retail financing have adversely affected the industry 
these conditions were aggravated by the exit of several consumer lenders in calendar  and as a result there has been a reduction in the volume of loans being written  particularly in the chattel  or home only  portion of the business  related largely to single section homes 
in late  conseco and oakwood homes  which at the time were two of the major providers of retail financing to the manufactured housing industry  filed for bankruptcy protection and effectively withdrew from this market 
subsequently  conseco and oakwood aggressively liquidated their inventories of repossessed homes  which depressed demand and pricing for new homes even further 
we expect the industry will benefit in the future from these accelerated efforts to liquidate repossessed homes  thereby reducing the competition with new homes 
in fact  there are indications that inventories of foreclosed homes are declining 
however  we expect we will continue to be challenged by the overhang of repossessions in the near term 
in the meantime  industry home shipments for calendar year were lower than in any year since as a result of these conditions  over the past three years there have been significant industry manufacturing and retail capacity reductions 
we expect that the operating environment for manufactured housing will stabilize in fiscal  but will continue to be challenging 
new national lenders have begun providing manufactured housing retail financing  although in limited amounts and using conservative underwriting practices 
depending on the extent of the financing actually resulting from these and other developments  combined with financing made available through fleetwood s own homeone credit corp 
finance subsidiary  it is anticipated that manufactured housing industry conditions could begin to moderate in future months 
recent industry shipments appear to support a stabilization of the wholesale market 
for fiscal  we expect to achieve improved profitability in the rv group and the wholesale division of the housing group  although we still expect to incur an operating loss at our retail division 
due largely to continued strength in our rv business  we expect to be profitable for the full fiscal year 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal years ended april net sales cost of products sold gross profit operating and other expenses operating income loss other income expense investment income interest expense other  net loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change benefit provision for income taxes loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net of income taxes net loss consolidated results fiscal year compared with fiscal year consolidated results the following table presents net loss and diluted loss per share for fiscal and amounts in thousands  except per share data fiscal years ended april amount of net sales amount of net sales change change net loss    diluted loss per share 
our net loss decreased by million to million  primarily due to a percent increase in sales and a resulting million increase in operating income 
a strong rv market  particularly in motor homes  combined with a stabilizing housing market contributed to the smaller net loss 
the net losses for both fiscal and were negatively impacted by adjustments of million and million  respectively  to reduce our net deferred tax asset 
the million adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal was caused by a reduction in available tax planning opportunities 
the primary reason for this reduction was an increase in the market value of our convertible trust securities of fleetwood capital trust i 
net sales the following table presents consolidated net sales by group for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change rv    housing    supply    financial services    net sales    consolidated net sales increased by percent or million 
a strong recreational vehicle market and improved motor home products drove a percent sales increase in rvs  offset by a percent decline in housing group revenues

all areas of our business experienced rising raw material costs as prices for timber  steel  aluminum and other commodities increased 
these material cost increases  combined with the introduction of new products  offset the positive impacts of higher pricing and a shift to higher margin products 
overall  gross margins for rvs decreased from percent to percent 
housing group gross margin improved from percent to percent 
the wholesale division was able to manage cost increases more effectively and also benefited from improving operating efficiencies to raise gross margin by percent to percent 
retail gross margin was down percent from the effects of competitive market conditions and reducing aged inventory 
operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses for fiscal and amounts in thousands fiscal years ended april amount of net sales amount of net sales change change selling    warranty and service    general and administrative    operating expenses    higher rv sales and enhanced marketing initiatives accounted for most of the increase in selling expenses  which remained flat as a percentage of sales 
the housing group reduced product warranty and service expense following a reorganization of the service organization in fiscal warranty expenses at the rv group increased on higher sales but still decreased as a percentage of revenue 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal include million for the legal settlement of two class action suits and million for retail adjusting entries 
excluding these items  expenses increased by million but decreased by percent as a percentage of sales 
other  net other charges  net in fiscal consists exclusively of net gain on sale of fixed assets of million 
the sale of the drapery facility along with two idle plants generated million of the gain 
the prior year net gain of million included net gains on sale of fixed assets of million related to the sale of facilities and land 
the prior year also included million of asset impairment charges and million of restructuring costs in the housing group 
other income expense other income expense increased by million to million in fiscal when compared to the previous year 
net interest expense increased by million as a result of the issuance of the million convertible debentures combined with lower interest income 
also  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into various privately negotiated transactions with the holders of convertible preferred securities of fleetwood capital trust iii to convert their securities to common stock prior to their redemption dates 
we paid a premium of million in excess of interest accrued that is included in other income expense 
recreational vehicles the following table presents rv group net sales by division for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change motor homes    travel trailers    folding trailers    net sales    the motor home division s performance was the result of improved market conditions and favorable acceptance of our mid line diesel products and new class a gas motor home products 
for fiscal year  class a diesel product shipments rose percent while class a gas and class c shipments rose percent and percent  respectively 
travel trailer revenues increased percent to million on a percent increase in unit volume 
the disproportionate increase in travel trailer revenues to shipments reflects the sales growth of larger  higher priced floor plans in the conventional and fifth wheel products offered 
folding trailer sales declined percent to million on a percent decline in unit volume 
the rv group earned million of operating income in the fiscal year ended april   compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the million increase in profitability was mainly due to the increase in diesel sales  which have higher selling prices and gross margins  and profit in travel trailers compared to an operating loss in the prior period as a result of higher revenues and gross margins 
operating expenses decreased from percent of sales to percent but increased million in the current year primarily due to higher selling costs from expanded rv market initiatives and higher warranty costs

housing group revenues declined by percent to million 
operating losses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal after deducting intercompany profit on retail inventory of million and million  respectively 
wholesale operations gross manufacturing revenues in fiscal year were million  down percent from the prior year  and included million of intercompany sales to company owned retail sales centers 
manufacturing unit volume declined percent to  homes  but the total number of housing sections was down percent to  due to a slight shift in sales mix toward single section homes 
multi section homes represented percent of factory shipments versus percent last year 
sales volume was below the prior year because of a weaker manufactured housing market  which has been adversely affected by competition from repossessed units and restrictive retail financing conditions 
in addition  the industry s two largest retail lenders and the two largest inventory floorplan lenders exited the business 
gross profit margin for the wholesale division increased from percent to percent of sales  mainly as a result of improving labor efficiencies and reducing manufacturing overhead 
operating costs declined million or percent as a result of reduced product warranty expenses 
the reduction in warranty service costs is attributable to the fiscal reorganization of the service organization 
overall results improved from an operating loss of million to an operating profit of million due to the improvement in gross margins and the reduction in warranty costs 
retail operations retail housing s revenues declined percent from million to million for fiscal year unit sales for the retail operation were down percent to  homes 
the average unit price increased by percent to  for the current year due to the sale of more multi section homes and less discounting of prices 
as a result of aggressively selling aged inventory  gross margins declined from percent in the prior year to percent 
the retail division incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal year  before interest expense on inventory financing  compared to an operating loss of million last year 
the improvement mainly resulted from a percent reduction in operating expenses 
the operating expense reduction included a million charge in the prior year for incorrect balance sheet adjusting entries related to integrating and then converting unique accounting systems from previously acquired dealers into a single system 
interest expense on inventory financing decreased slightly from million to million

the significantly lower net loss in fiscal year was the result of a million turnaround in the rv group operating results from a loss of million in fiscal to an operating profit of million in fiscal partially offsetting the rv group results was an increase in the housing group operating loss from million to million 
a substantial portion of the loss in fiscal was attributable to an million non cash charge  net of tax  for impairment of goodwill related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

the increase related to a full year of interest expense of the trust ii and iii convertible trust preferred securities 
the prior year included interest expense of million for yield maintenance charges related to the early retirement of the senior unsecured notes on july  excluding these items  interest expense was lower this year mainly due to a smaller retail housing inventory floorplan liability resulting from a reduction in inventories  combined with lower interest expense on other borrowings 
investment income was down percent from the prior year as a result of lower interest rates on lower invested balances

wholesale operations gross wholesale revenues in fiscal year were million  down percent from the prior year  and included million of intercompany sales to company owned retail sales centers 
wholesale unit volume declined percent to  homes  but the number of housing sections was off a lesser percent to  due to the continuing shift in sales mix toward multi section homes 
multi section homes represented percent of factory sales versus percent in the prior year 
sales volume was below the prior year because of a weaker manufactured housing market  which has been adversely affected by competition from repossessed units and restrictive retail financing conditions 
this condition has further deteriorated in the past year because of legislation in texas  the largest manufactured housing state  which had the effect of restricting the use of chattel financing 
during the same period  the industry s two largest retail lenders and the two largest inventory floorplan lenders exited the business 
gross profit margin for the wholesale division declined from percent to percent of sales  mainly as a result of improving the competitiveness of the product by adding features without commensurate price increases

overall operating results declined from an operating profit of million to a loss of million 
retail operations retail housing s revenues declined percent from million to million for fiscal year unit sales for the retail operation were off percent to  homes 
the smaller decrease in revenues resulted from a rise in the average unit price of percent to  for fiscal year due to the sale of more multi section homes and fewer homes at discounted prices 
as a result  gross margins improved from percent in the prior year to percent 
the retail division incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal year  before interest expense on inventory financing  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal the reduced loss mainly resulted from the higher gross margin and a percent reduction in operating expenses

supply operations including inter company sales  our supply group contributed revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  of which million and million  respectively  were sales to third party customers 
operating income decreased from million to million  primarily due to the introduction of a rebate structure with other group operations 
liquidity and capital resources we use external funding sources  including the issuance of debt and equity instruments  to supplement working capital  fund capital expenditures and meet internal cash flow requirements on an as needed basis 
cash totaling million was used in operating activities during fiscal year compared to million for the similar period one year ago 
in fiscal  the most significant use of cash related to receivable  inventory and accounts payable working capital requirements totaling million stemming from the percent increase in revenues 
in fiscal  these same working capital requirements used million in cash  principally due to a planned build up of motor home and travel trailer inventories 
the increase in other liabilities includes million and million for interest expense accrued but deferred on the convertible trust preferred securities in fiscal and  respectively 
additional cash outlays in fiscal years and included million and million in capital expenditures 
also  homeone generated finance loans receivable of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
at fiscal year end  short term borrowings under our secured syndicated credit facility  led by bank of america  na  as administrative agent  were million 
at year end  lender commitments to the facility totaled million 
our borrowing capacity  however  is governed by the amount of a borrowing base  consisting of inventories and accounts receivable  that fluctuates significantly from week to week 
the borrowing base is revised weekly for changes in receivables and monthly for changes in inventory balances 
under the borrowing agreement as it was in effect at the end of the fiscal year  million had to be maintained as minimum unused availability  with the remainder available to support standby letters of credit and fund borrowings 
this provision was eliminated upon completion of our amended and restated credit agreement discussed below 
at the end of the fiscal year  the borrowing base totaled million 
after consideration of the unused minimum requirement  collateral reserves of million  million in standby letters of credit and the outstanding borrowings  unused borrowing capacity was approximately million 
short term borrowings also include million from our warehouse line used to fund homeone finance loans receivable 
long term debt increased by approximately million as a result of the senior convertible subordinated debenture offering 
as a result of the above mentioned changes  cash and marketable investments increased million from million as of april   to million as of april  credit agreement amendments on july   the ebitda covenant in the credit facility was amended to accommodate additional losses at our retail operation 
in addition  we requested and obtained consent to the amendment from textron financial corporation textron  in that our wholesale financing agreement with textron is subject to a cross default provision and a covenant  in which fleetwood agreed that it would not modify the adjusted ebitda covenant in the senior credit facility without their prior consent 
on december   we announced that we had further amended the credit facility  primarily to enable the issuance of million of the convertible senior subordinated debentures 
the amendment provided for the priority use of the proceeds from the sale of the new securities to pay off the then outstanding loan balance under the facility  without a reduction to the amount of the credit commitment 
provisions were also added to allow  for a period of six months  the use of cash in the amount of the proceeds to redeem debentures underlying any of our trust preferred securities and retire them 
on february   we announced that the lenders in the syndicated line had agreed to again restate the financial covenant relating to cumulative ebitda 
in return  fleetwood paid a fee of one eighth of a percent of the commitment amount to the syndicate 
we also announced at the same time that we had amended our inventory financing agreement with textron for the same covenant 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  on may   we announced the early renewal and extension of the credit facility to july   under a fully underwritten arrangement with bank of america 
the terms of the amended and restated agreement provide for an increase of million in the amount of the facility  to a commitment level of million 
among other changes was the elimination of the previous requirement for the company to maintain million in unused borrowing capacity  which directly enhances our potential borrowing availability 
the requirement for excess boot collateral  held in the form of a security interest in real estate was also reduced from million to million 
under the new agreement  we are not subject to a financial performance covenant  except in the case that our average monthly liquidity  defined as cash  cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity  falls below million within the borrowing subsidiaries or million including the parent company 
under these circumstances we are required to meet a designated cumulative ebitda requirement that has been restated to reflect the current outlook for earnings 
in addition  pricing under the new facility was reduced in all areas  including fees for letters of credit  unused facility fees and interest charges on borrowings 
simultaneous with the signing of the agreement  we paid closing and administrative fees to the bank equal to percent of the new million credit commitment 
it was the bank s intent to syndicate the facility subsequent to the closing 
in conjunction with the restatement of the credit agreement  we executed covenant amendments to our flooring finance agreement with textron that mirror the new bank agreement

with million shares of new trust preferred issued in the exchange offer  the potential dilution to common shareholders upon conversion of the new exchange offer trust preferred was million common shares 
as a result of the exchange  debentures supporting the exchanged convertible trust preferred securities were cancelled  resulting in a taxable gain of million 
after deducting taxes of million  the remainder of million was reported as an increase to additional paid in capital and treated as income attributable to common shareholders in the calculation of earnings per share 
in conjunction with the exchange offer  we offered to sell for cash million of convertible trust iii preferred securities due february  the cash offer closed on december  each trust iii preferred security issued in the cash offer was convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time into shares of fleetwood common stock ie  a conversion price of per common share 
with million shares of new trust preferred issued in the cash offer  the potential dilution to common shareholders upon conversion of the new cash offer trust preferred was million common shares 
on march   the company announced that it was calling million aggregate principal amount of the trust iii preferred securities for redemption 
subsequently  on march   the company called the remaining million aggregate principal amount of trust iii preferred securities for redemption 
subsequently  virtually all of the holders of the trust iii preferred securities converted their securities into an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock  including some who had entered into privately negotiated transactions with the company to convert their securities  prior to the respective redemption dates  in exchange for a cash incentive 
as a result  as of april   there remained  shares of trust iii preferred securities outstanding  with an aggregate principal amount of million  and as of april   which was the final redemption date pursuant to the company s calls for redemption  there were no trust iii preferred securities outstanding 
subsequent to fiscal year end  on may   the company called the trust ii preferred securities for redemption with a redemption date of june  several of the holders of the trust ii preferred securities converted their holdings to shares of the company s common stock  including some who entered into privately negotiated transactions with the company to convert their securities  prior to the redemption date  in exchange for a cash incentive 
accordingly  as of the june redemption date  pursuant to the company s call for redemption   shares of the trust ii preferred securities had been converted into an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock  and  shares of the trust ii preferred securities were redeemed for an aggregate of million in cash  representing million in aggregate amount  million in redemption premium and  in accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date 
dividends and distributions on october   the board of directors discontinued the payment of dividends on our common stock in conjunction with an election to defer distributions on our existing convertible trust preferred securities 
we have the right to elect to defer distributions for up to consecutive quarters under the trust indenture governing the existing convertible trust preferred securities 
when we defer a distribution on the convertible trust preferred securities  we are prevented from declaring or paying dividends on our common stock during the period of the deferral 
in light of our business environment and recent operating results  we currently anticipate that we will find it necessary to defer distributions on the existing convertible trust preferred securities for the foreseeable future  subject to the terms of the governing documents 
at the end of fiscal  we have deferred million  including accrued interest at percent on the deferred amounts 
other in the opinion of management  the combination of existing cash resources  expected future cash flows from operations  and available lines of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable cash requirements for the next months  including up to million for capital expenditures  to be utilized primarily for enhancements to motor home manufacturing facilities

the debentures are convertible  under certain circumstances  into the company s common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures  equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of common stock 
most of the company s retail sales locations and certain of its other facilities are leased under terms that range from monthly to years 
also included in the above amounts are equipment leases 
management expects that in the normal course of business  leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases to support continuing operations 
we have an operating agreement with a large dealer who manages retail store locations for frc 
either party may terminate the agreement by giving written notice days in advance of the date of the termination 
if termination notice is provided  fleetwood is obligated to repurchase the outstanding inventory at that time for the amount of the dealer s obligations to its flooring institutions 
similarly  an equivalent amount is included in the aggregate repurchase obligation described in note to the company s financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
that repurchase obligation would become due and payable to the flooring institution only in the event the dealer defaults prior to its agreement with fleetwood being terminated 
the convertible subordinated debentures were issued in three separate transactions  and are currently reflected on the balance sheet as a long term liability

off balance sheet arrangements in march  fleetwood entered into a sale and leaseback agreement involving manufactured housing retail stores 
the minimum rental payments required under this agreement are included in the contractual obligations schedule above  under operating leases 
the agreement includes a contingent rental reset provision which provides that  in the event that the company s credit rating falls below a certain level anytime prior to march  the company could be required  at the option of the lessor  to make an accelerated rent payment equal to the unamortized principal of the lessor s underlying debt 
since entering into the agreement  the company s credit rating has fallen below the specified level  raising the possibility that the provision could be exercised in march the accelerated payment would be approximately million 
a number of alternatives to the accelerated rent payment are currently available to the company and are being considered 
it is likely that sometime prior to march  the company will move to restructure the arrangement to mitigate the potential negative cash impact 
we describe our aggregate contingent repurchase obligation in note to the company s financial statements and under critical accounting policies in this part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report 
under the senior credit agreement  fleetwood enterprises  inc is a guarantor of the borrowings of fleetwood holdings  inc fhi and fleetwood retail corp 
frc 
fhi includes most of the wholly owned manufacturing subsidiaries and frc includes all the retail housing subsidiaries 
only the frc parent company  however  and seven of the retail subsidiaries are borrowers under the loan and covered under the guarantee 
in addition  fleetwood enterprises  inc guarantees frc s floorplan obligations to textron and bombardier capital  inc pursuant to frc s wholesale financing agreements with the two flooring institutions 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  these guarantees were renewed to extend through the term of the amended and restated agreement to july under the warehouse line of credit  initiated in december  between homeone credit corp  our captive finance subsidiary  and greenwich capital financial products  inc  fleetwood enterprises  inc 
is a guarantor of the borrowings 
early in fiscal  fleetwood enterprises  inc entered into three limited guarantees aggregating  to certain obligations of certain retailers to floorplan lenders 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation specifies the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements concerning its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin also requires a guarantor to recognize a liability  at the inception of the guarantee  for the fair value of obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  the initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of fin are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  accordingly  we adopted the disclosure provisions of fin  which have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic method as permitted by sfas no 
and prominently disclose the additional information required by sfas no 
in our annual and interim reports 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires an issuer to classify a financial instrument issued in the form of shares that are mandatorily redeemable that embodies an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem them by transferring its assets at a specified or determinable date as a liability 
this statement was adopted during fiscal and had no impact on our financial reporting 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance concerning when a company should consolidate in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
a revised interpretation was issued in december fin r 
prior to the issuance of fin  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin now requires a variable interest entity  as defined in fin  to be consolidated by a company only if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the company has owned three delaware business trusts that were established for the purpose of issuing optionally redeemable convertible trust preferred securities 
the obligations of the business trusts to the holders of the trust preferred securities were all supported by convertible subordinated debentures issued by fleetwood to the respective business trusts 
subsequent to the end of the fiscal year the preferred securities of two of the trusts were either converted or redeemed  and the debentures cancelled 
under fin  which was adopted by the company as of january   the trust preferred securities continued to be presented as minority interests based on the fact that the company has had the ability to call the trust preferred securities and that no single party holds a majority of the preferred securities  therefore  the company was considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts 
under fin r  which was adopted by the company as of april   the business trusts were deemed to have no primary beneficiary and as required  were deconsolidated  resulting in the presentation of the convertible subordinated debenture obligations to the underlying trusts as a long term liability for all years presented 
amounts previously shown in the statements of operations as minority interest in fleetwood capital trusts i  ii and iii  net of taxes  were reclassified for all periods presented to interest expense  with the related tax effect included in the tax provision 
other than as indicated  the company does not believe that the adoption of fin or fin r will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  employers disclosure about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
a revision of the pronouncement originally issued in  sfas r expands employers disclosure requirements for pension and postretirement benefits to enhance information about plan assets  obligations  benefit payments  contributions and net benefit cost 
sfas r does not change the accounting requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement was implemented beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal the company has determined that there are no material benefits requiring disclosure under this pronouncement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on marketable investments  investments underlying a company owned life insurance program coli  variable rate debt under the secured credit facility  the liability for flooring of retail housing inventories and the warehouse line of credit 
with respect to the coli program  the underlying investments are subject to both interest rate risk and equity market risk 
market related changes to our convertible trust preferred securities indirectly may impact the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance  which is currently dependent on available tax strategies  including the unrealized gains on these securities 
we do not currently use interest rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the vast majority of our marketable investments are in institutional money market funds or fixed rate securities with average original maturity dates of two weeks or less  minimizing the effect of interest rate fluctuations on their fair value 
for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not influence fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at the end of the year  and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of an annual period would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  for both fixed rate loans and debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but not earnings or cash flows 
changes in fair market values as a result of interest rate changes are not currently expected to be material 
we do not believe that future market equity or interest rate risks related to our marketable investments or debt obligations will have a material impact on our results
