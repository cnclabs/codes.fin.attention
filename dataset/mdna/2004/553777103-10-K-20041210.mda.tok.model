thus  the company has expected cash flows  assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar or the functional currencies of its international subsidiaries

vi the company experiences competition on a worldwide basis 
customers may choose to purchase equipment from the company or from its competitors 
for certain of the company s products  customers may contract with testing laboratories or construct their own testing equipment from commercially available components 
factors that may influence a customer s decision include price  service  and required level of technology
