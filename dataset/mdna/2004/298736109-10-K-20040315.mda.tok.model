item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  in september we sold our atms in hungary to an established hungarian financial institution 
in connection with the sale  we entered into a long term outsourcing agreement and cash sponsorship arrangement with the financial institution 
also in  euronet complemented its existing two segments with a third business that focuses on processing transactions for prepaid services  primarily for prepaid mobile airtime  which operates as our prepaid processing segment 
in february  we acquired e pay ltd e pay 
see note acquisitions 
e pay is an electronic payments processor of prepaid top up services in the u 
k  australia  poland  ireland and new zealand 
additionally  e pay owns of the shares of e pay malaysia  a separate company that offers electronic top up in malaysia and  through a subsidiary of e pay malaysia  in indonesia 
e pay has agreements with mobile operators in those markets under which it supports the distribution of airtime to their subscribers through more than  pos terminals in approximately  retail locations 
with this acquisition  we gained offices in london and sydney 
we maintain e pay s data center in basildon  uk but established a connection between that center and euronet s existing data center in budapest  hungary 
in the second half of  we expanded the prepaid processing segment with acquisitions in the us and in germany 
in september  we purchased all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of austin international marketing and investments  inc aim 
aim is a us based electronic top up company  processing prepaid transactions via pos terminals in states on approximately  pos terminals 
generally  this business will operate as part of the us based prepaid service branded as payspot 
in november  we acquired the german company transact elektronische zahlungssysteme gmbh transact  the market leader in electronic processing of prepaid mobile airtime top up services in germany  with a market share of approximately of electronic top up transactions 
transact currently supports top up purchases at more than  of their installed base of over  pos terminals in approximately  retail locations 
with this acquisition  we acquired an office in munich 
in january  our wholly owned subsidiary  payspot  inc  acquired of the shares of prepaid concepts  inc precept 
see note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements 
precept provides prepaid top up services in the us and the acquisition of precept should greatly expand our prepaid processing segment in the us precept currently processes top up sales at more than  pos terminals 
with this acquisition  we acquired an additional office in orange county  california 
as of december   we operated in three principal business segments 
the first is the eft processing segment formerly called the processing services segment  which comprises our proprietary atm network and outsourced management of atms for banks 
it includes various new processing services that we provide for banks and mobile phone companies through our atm network and managed atms  such as mobile phone recharge services 
our second principal segment is the prepaid processing segment new in  which comprises three subsidiaries and is focused on providing prepaid services  primarily prepaid mobile airtime via pos devices at retail locations 
our third principal segment is the software solutions segment  which provides transaction processing software solutions to banks that enable them to operate atms and pos terminals  issue credit and debit cards and process financial transactions through various touch points

market opportunity and segment overview for discussion of the amount of total revenue contributed by each segment  please see note business segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
eft processing segment our eft processing segment provides services to banks and mobile phone companies primarily in the developing markets of central and southern europe hungary  poland  the czech republic  croatia  romania  slovakia  serbia and greece  egypt  indonesia and india  as well as in developed countries of western europe germany and the uk although all of these markets present market opportunities for expanding the sales of our services  we believe opportunities for transaction growth in the atm services business are greater in the developing countries 
our atm network enables cardholders to make cash withdrawals  balance inquiries and other transactions with cards issued by banks 
the number of transactions made on our atms depends on the number of bankcards issued in the country where the atms are located 
in the developing markets  the number of cards currently issued per person is substantially lower than in the developed markets  but is increasing rapidly 
we believe transaction levels in the developing markets will increase eventually to approximate those of the developed markets as banks bring new customers into the banking system and issue more cards to their existing customers 
therefore  the growth rates that we expect to achieve from transaction based revenues in developing markets are higher than in developed markets 
in the european markets  atms are located primarily at bank branches  as compared to a broader array of sites in the us we believe opportunities are available in these markets to provide atm access in places where our experience suggests that customers use atms more frequently  such as in shopping malls and large retail outlets 
economic development in the developing markets also influences the growth rates we expect for certain other services we offer 
for example  banks seeking to expand and develop their business in developing markets are good potential clients for our existing atm network  as we can provide their customers access to atms we have already installed in those markets 
likewise  we offer banks outsourced atm services whereby we will establish a network of atms for banks and operate those atms for a fixed monthly fee or a combination of a fixed monthly fee and transaction fees 
when a bank cardholder conducts a transaction on a euronet owned atm  we receive a fee from the cardholder s bank for that transaction 
the bank pays us this fee either directly or indirectly through a central switching and settlement network 
when paid indirectly  this fee is referred to as the interchange fee 
all of the banks in a shared atm and pos switching system establish the amount of the interchange fee by agreement 
we believe banks in both the developing and developed markets are becoming more receptive to outsourcing the operation of their atms and pos networks 
the operation of these devices requires expensive hardware and software and specialized personnel 
we have these resources available and offer them to banks under outsourcing contracts that require the banks to pay a monthly and or transaction based fee to us 
this arrangement substantially reduces the investment a bank needs to make to operate its atms and pos terminals 
we believe opportunities exist for developing our outsourcing business in all of our markets 
prepaid processing segment we entered the prepaid processing business through the acquisition of e pay in february and began reporting its results in a new segment called the prepaid processing segment beginning in the first quarter of subsequent to its acquisition  e pay expanded its operations into new zealand  ireland and poland 
in the second half of  euronet further expanded the prepaid processing segment with acquisitions of aim in the us and transact in germany 
customers using mobile phones pay for their usage in two ways through postpaid accounts  where usage is billed at the end of each billing period  and through prepaid accounts  where customers pay in advance by crediting their accounts prior to usage 
although operators in the us and certain european countries have provided service principally through postpaid accounts  the trend in europe and other countries offering wireless services has shifted toward prepaid accounts 
this shift is driven  according to oftel surveys the uk telecommunications regulator  by customers belief that prepaid products better meet their needs and enable them to better control their monthly wireless expenditures 
moreover  the mobile operators favor prepaid because they do not take the credit risk with respect to payment for airtime usage 
in certain developing markets  the majority of mobile phones are prepaid 
currently two principal methods are available to credit prepaid accounts referred to as top up of accounts 
the first is through the purchase of scratch cards bearing code numbers that  when entered into a customer s mobile phone account  credit the account by the value of airtime purchased 
scratch cards are sold predominantly through retail outlets 
the second is through various electronic means of crediting accounts using pos terminals 
electronic top up or e top up methods have several advantages over scratch cards  primarily because electronic methods do not require the cost of creation  distribution and management of a physical inventory of cards or involve the risk of losses stemming from fraud and theft 
scratch cards are the predominant method of crediting mobile phone accounts in most developed markets  but a shift is occurring in these markets away from usage of scratch cards to more efficient e top up methods 
in the uk  for example  we estimate that approximately of all top ups were performed through e top ups in early by december  we estimate that as much as of all uk top ups were performed through e top ups 
our prepaid processing segment processes the distribution of prepaid mobile phone minutes to consumers through networks of pos terminals and direct connections to the electronic payment systems of retailers 
in some markets  we enter into agreements with mobile phone operators and connect directly to their back office systems 
in other markets such as germany and the us  we distribute mobile phone time by connecting directly to the mobile operators or by purchasing pins personal identification numbers that enable airtime top up from third party sources  who have negotiated with the mobile operator 
we then distribute the mobile phone time through an electronic network  either through a direct credit from the mobile operator to the mobile phone  or sales of pins 
the business has grown rapidly over the past year as new retailers have been added and prepaid airtime has switched from scratch cards to distribution by electronic means 
we maintain contractual relationships with the retailers or networks that operate the pos terminals through which we distribute pins 
our agreements with major retailers generally are multiyear agreements  whereas agreements with small retailers are terminable on three months notice 
in europe  we generally provide the pos terminals free of charge and incur the expense of installing those terminals in the retail outlets 
in the us  the retailers generally pay for the pos terminals 
in the us  we are attempting to achieve leverage in expanding our network by contracting with distributors or networks of pos or atm terminals generally referred to as independent sales organizations or isos that are paid a commission for delivering us contracts with retailers in their networks to distribute pins on their terminals 
as a result of our agreements with isos in the us  our relationships with the retailers are sometimes indirect through the distributor or iso 
we establish an electronic connection with the pos terminals and maintain systems that monitor transaction levels at each terminal 
as sales to customers of mobile phone time are completed  the customer pays the retailer and the retailer becomes obligated to make settlement of the principal amount of the phone time sold 
at e pay  these amounts are deposited in accounts that are held in trust for the mobile operators 
in germany and the us  retailer accounts are directly debited on a contractually defined basis 
no trust arrangements are required in germany or the us with respect to amounts settled to us 
we maintain systems that permit us to monitor the payment practices of each retailer 
the prepaid processing segment now supports top up transactions at more than  points of sale in  locations across nine countries 
we believe substantial opportunities exist to provide electronic top up services to mobile operators 
we intend to leverage these opportunities by using the technology and business methods we have developed or acquired 
software solutions segment although our software solutions segment is headquartered in the us  the majority of our software customers is international and  in particular  located in developing markets 
this distribution is largely because our software products  based on the integrated transaction management itm core system  are relatively small and inexpensive packages that are appropriate for banks with up to billion in assets with various transaction processing needs 
euronet software is the preferred transaction processing software for banks that operate their back office software using the ibm iseries platform  which is also a relatively inexpensive  expandable hardware platform 
our software offering includes modules for atm management  pos management  merchant management  debit card and credit card systems  telephone banking  internet banking and mobile banking 
we believe demand will continue for our software from banks in many markets and throughout the developing world as new banks are established 
once a customer purchases our software and installs the core system  we provide a series of modules  upgrades and maintenance services that often result in recurring revenues for us 
strategy eft processing segment the expansion and enhancement of our outsourced management solutions  both in existing markets and new markets  will remain an important business strategy 
we also will focus heavily on the development of our outsourced management solutions with fixed fee arrangements 
we believe increasing the number of bank owned atms that we operate under management agreements will provide continued growth while minimizing the capital we place at risk 
we continually strive to make our own atm networks more efficient by eliminating the underperforming atms and installing atms in more desirable locations 
we have expanded our outsourced management solutions beyond atms to include card management and additional services  such as pos terminal management  bill payment and prepaid mobile operator solutions 
we support these services using our proprietary software products 
the introduction of value added services for delivery over our atm network has resulted in increased transactions and revenues 
in the last several years  we developed and entered into a number of agreements for a new line of services involving the use of our atm networks and central processing infrastructure to enable mobile phone users the ability to purchase prepaid mobile phone time on atms and on mobile phones 
we contract with mobile phone providers to facilitate their sale of mobile phone time  and we are paid a commission on each sale  often a percentage of the value of the mobile phone time purchased 
in this regard  we also contract with banks to use their atms for the distribution of mobile phone time  thereby expanding the distribution networks we can offer to mobile phone operators 
we offer these transaction types as a service enhancement to existing clients  or as a pass through service on atms that are owned and operated by others 
this atm and mobile recharge line of services has been substantially strengthened through complementary services obtained by our acquisitions of e pay  transact  aim and precept 
we can now provide top up services through pos terminals 
we intend to expand our technology and business methods into other markets where we operate and hope to leverage our relationships with mobile phone companies and banks in those markets to cross sell and to facilitate that expansion 
prepaid processing segment we plan to expand our prepaid mobile phone top up business into new and our existing markets by taking advantage of our existing relationships with mobile phone operators and retailers 
this expansion will depend on various factors  including the following the ability to negotiate new agreements with mobile phone operators and retailers in these markets the ability to negotiate acceptable distribution commissions or transaction processing fees the continuation of the trend of increased use of electronic prepaid airtime among mobile phone users the development of mobile phone networks and the increase in the number of mobile phone users in these markets the availability of financing for expansion software solutions segment we downsized our software solutions segment in january to bring expenses in line with revenues  and this segment s improved results have contributed to our overall results in and we have made significant progress in reducing software delivery times and adding resources to enhance and expand our software products 
software products are now an integral part of our product lines  and our investment in research  development  delivery and customer support reflects our ongoing commitment to an expanded customer base 
we have found significant opportunities for cross selling processing services to our software solutions customers and that our ability to develop  adapt and control our own software gives us credibility with our processing services customers 
in addition  during we entered into agreements under which we used our software in lieu of cash as our initial capital contributions to new transaction processing joint ventures that were created in for example  in serbia 
such contribution permits us to enter new markets without any cash outlay 
therefore  although revenues from our software solutions segment are not currently growing significantly  we view it as a valuable element of our overall business strategy 
our software is used by our budapest and india processing centers in our eft processing segment  resulting in cost savings and added value compared to third party license and maintenance options 
our strategy in the software solutions segment in included improvement of the application functionality for our core debit and credit solutions 
our software was upgraded to become compliant with certain new mandates of the international card organizations  involving initiatives such as emv europay  mastercard and visa chip card support and triple des data encryption standard support 
emv standards define the technology required for issuance and acceptance of chip cards 
triple des security standards represent a significant strengthening of encryption requirements to further protect sensitive data that is transmitted in transactions 
these emerging industry standards have been jointly developed by the three major card associations and we believe they will have a significant influence over eft related hardware and software decisions throughout the next five years 
our ability to provide support for mandated initiatives such as emv and triple des may provide significant opportunities to sell updated software to our existing customers and may enable euronet to replace competitors non compliant solutions 
in the last three years  we also undertook a strategy of signing customers to extended long term software maintenance agreements 
we continue to invest in emerging markets and technologies that complement our processing and software solutions 
acquisitions in january  we purchased all of the share capital of precept  a company based in california 
the purchase price for the precept shares was approximately million 
we paid million in cash  issued promissory notes in the original principal amount of million and issued  shares of our common stock for the precept shares 
of the issued shares of our common stock   shares have been held in escrow and will be released on february   subject to certain performance criteria

in addition  at any time prior to the maturity date  the amount outstanding under these notes is convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the holders  at a conversion price of per share 
we filed a registration statement with the sec to enable the public resale of the common stock issued to the former shareholders of precept  and that registration statement was declared effective by the sec in february for further discussion on precept  see note to the consolidated financial statements subsequent events 
in november  we purchased of the shares of the german company  transact 
transact was founded in and specializes in payment processing services and software for electronic financial transactions and prepaid mobile phone transactions on pos terminals  as well as retailer till systems 
additionally  transact offers a proprietary line of pos terminals  including general packet radio system gprs based products  including pos terminals 
transact currently supports mobile phone top up purchases at more than  of their installed base of over  pos terminals in approximately  retail locations 
the purchase price consisted of million approximately million as of the acquistion date in cash and  shares of common stock  plus an additional earn out payment due on january   which is payable pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement and certain certificates issued to transact s shareholders 
the earn out will be calculated based on transact s ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as described in the purchase agreement and the certificates for the third quarter of  together with certain other performance criteria described in the purchase agreement and the certificates 
based upon current projections of the future performance of transact  as to which there can be no assurances  we estimate that the second installment of the purchase price will be between and million 
subject to certain ebitda multiples  of the second installment of the purchase price is payable in cash  and the other is payable  at our option  either in cash or in common stock valued for these purposes at per share 
the second installment of the purchase price is subject to reduction or deferred payment based upon a number of factors  including the extent of the total proportion of transact s business in certain defined customer agreements 
our ability to issue shares exceeding approximately of our shares of common stock outstanding as of november  in order to pay the second installment of the purchase price will be subject to stockholder approval 
the transfer of the transact shares to us is staged  with of the shares transferred at closing and the remaining transferred on payment of the second installment of the purchase price 
we filed a registration statement with the sec to enable the public resale of the common stock issued to the former shareholders of transact  and that registration statement was declared effective by the sec in february in order to fund the transact acquisition  in november  we privately placed  shares of our common stock with fletcher international  ltd 
fletcher  an accredited institutional investor  which we refer to as fletcher  and received proceeds of million 
the per share purchase price of was based on the volume weighted average price for our shares of common stock on november   plus per share 
in addition  we granted fletcher certain additional investment rights entitling fletcher to purchase up to an additional million in value of our common stock 
the shares of our common stock subject to the additional investment rights  should fletcher exercise these rights  will be purchased at a per share price equal to either i the prevailing price at the time of exercise of the additional investment rights based on a volume weighted average formula or ii if the prevailing price is less than  the prevailing price minus per share 
the additional investment rights may be exercised by fletcher on one or more occasions commencing march   and for the month period thereafter  which period may be extended under certain circumstances 
we may not compel fletcher to exercise its additional investment rights 
we filed a registration statement with the sec to enable the public resale of the common stock issued to fletcher  and that registration statement was declared effective by the sec in february in september  we acquired the assets of aim  a us based top up company 
the assets of aim were purchased on an earn out basis  with million of the purchase price being paid at closing in cash and shares of our common stock and the remainder being paid in our common stock valued at a day average at time of payment 
in the initial payment  we issued  shares of common stock 
this stock is restricted through the two year earn out period subject to the achievement of certain financial goals with maximum additional consideration of million 
in february  we purchased all of the share capital of e pay ltd 
from its shareholders for approximately million  excluding transaction costs 
components of the consideration paid were million cash consideration paid at closing million  shares of our common stock issued at closing million as follows million deferred purchase price bearing interest at per annum  which was fully prepaid during million convertible notes payable  which was converted into  shares of common stock on december  million notes payable due february  we filed two registration statements with the sec to enable the public resale of the common stock issued to the former shareholders of e pay 
those registration statements were declared effective by the sec in december in august  we purchased the remaining interest in dash  a us atm processing services company  for a consideration of  payable in equal monthly installments commencing on july  we delivered letters of credit to each of the sellers in the amount of the entire unpaid balance of the purchase price of dash  which have since been cancelled 
we then owned interest in dash 
dash was sold on january  for million in cash 
in march  we acquired installed atms in germany and atms in inventory from service bank gmbh co 
kg service bank 
the purchase price for this established atm network was million 
pursuant to the agreement  we received monthly fees based on revenues realized from the atms less certain expenses and management fees payable to service bank 
in november  we acquired the outstanding common stock of euronet usa for purchase consideration of approximately million including incidental costs of  and fair value of stock options of 
euronet usa is the software provider to euronet s atm transaction processing center in central europe 
dispositions in january  we sold of the shares of our uk subsidiary  euronet services uk ltd 
euronet uk to bridgepoint capital limited bridgepoint 
this transaction was effected through a share purchase agreement the acquisition agreement whereby eft services holding bv euronet holding  a netherlands corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of euronet  sold all of its shares of euronet uk to bank machine acquisitions limited bmal  a uk company owned by bridgepoint 
the acquisition agreement provided that the benefits and burdens of ownership of the shares and all employees of euronet uk were transferred to bridgepoint effective january  concurrently with this transaction  euronet and bank machine limited which is the new name of euronet uk following the acquisition signed an atm and gateway services agreement the services agreement 
under the services agreement  our hungarian subsidiary  euronet adminisztracios kft 
euronet hungary  provides atm operating  monitoring  and transaction processing services to bmal through december the services provided by euronet hungary are substantially identical to the services provided to euronet uk prior to its sale to bridgepoint 
we recorded a gain of approximately million related to this transaction 
because of the presence of a continued relationship through the year outsourcing agreement  we were precluded under us gaap from accounting for this transaction as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  we accounted for the gain on the sale as income from continuing operations 
in january  we sold substantially all of the assets of our atm processing business in the us  known as dash  to fnf formerly alltel information services  inc for million in cash 
we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million related to this transaction 
in july  we sold substantially all of the non current assets and capital lease obligations of our processing business in france to atos sa non current assets and capital lease obligations related to the france business have been removed from continuing operations and classified under discontinued operations 
we incurred a loss on disposal of the france business of million 
in previous filings  we reported the uk and france businesses under the western european sub segment and dash under the other operations sub segment 
all operating amounts  atm counts  transaction numbers and statistics reported in this filing exclude france and dash 
operations eft processing segment overview the major source of revenue generated by our atm network is transaction revenue 
we receive fixed monthly fees under many of our outsourced management contracts  and this element of revenue has been increasing over the last few years  but remains smaller than the transaction fee element 
the transactions processed by our atm network increased by  from million transactions in to million transactions in revenue sources of the eft processing segment also include outsourced management revenue  which is revenue from operating atms that we do not own  prepaid mobile phone recharge revenue from atm or mobile phone handsets and advertising revenue 
the number of atms operated increased from  at december  to  atms at december  euronet owns and or operates atms in hungary  poland  germany  croatia  the czech republic  the uk  greece  kosovo  slovakia  romania  egypt and india 
our experience is that the level of transactions on our networks is subject to seasonal variation 
transactions per atm tend to drop in the first quarter  as compared to the preceding fourth quarter  to the lowest levels we experience during the year  primarily due to a drop in post holiday travel and spending 
since revenues of the eft processing segment are more weighted toward transactions  this segment is directly affected by the seasonality we experience 
in years prior to  we believe our aggressive rollout of atms lessened the impact of seasonal variations on our overall transaction levels and revenues and transactions from new atms compensated for the reduction in overall transaction levels 
for a discussion of eft processing segment results  please see note business segment information to the consolidated financial statements and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
atm transaction processing our operations center uses our software solutions segment s integrated transaction management core software solution 
the atms in our networks are able to process transactions for holders of credit and debit cards issued by or bearing the logos of banks and international card organizations such as american express  diners club international  visa  mastercard and europay 
this ability is accomplished through our agreements and relationships with these banks  international credit and debit card issuers and international associations of card issuers 
in a typical atm transaction  the transaction is routed from the atm to our processing center  and then to the card issuer for authorization 
once authorization is received  the authorization message is routed back to the atm and the transaction is completed 
the card issuer is responsible for authorizing atm transactions processed on our atms 
the card issuer pays us a transaction processing fee for successful transactions and  in certain circumstances  for transactions that are not completed because they fail to receive authorization 
the fees paid to us by the card issuers are independent of any fees charged by the card issuers to cardholders in connection with the atm transactions 
we do not charge cardholders a transaction or access fee for using our atms 
we generally receive fees from our customers for four types of transactions that are processed on our atms cash withdrawals balance inquiries transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization prepaid telecommunication recharges transaction fees for cash withdrawals vary from market to market but generally range from to per transaction 
transaction fees for the other three types of transactions are generally substantially less 
in eft processing segment revenues  we include transaction fees payable under the electronic recharge solutions that we distribute through our atms 
fees for recharge transactions vary substantially from market to market and are based on the specific prepaid solution and the denomination of prepaid usage purchased 
generally  transaction fees vary from to per prepaid mobile recharge purchase and are shared with the financial institution and the mobile operator 
any or all of these fees may come under pricing pressure in the future 
we monitor the number of transactions made by cardholders on our network 
these include cash withdrawals  balance inquiries  deposits  mobile phone airtime recharge purchases and certain denied unauthorized transactions 
we do not bill certain transactions on our network to banks  and we have excluded these transactions for reporting purposes 
the number of transactions processed over our entire atm network has increased over the last five years as follows total transactions per year were million in  million in  million in  million in and million in the number of transactions processed monthly grew from approximately million in december to approximately million in december a number of factors affect the transaction volumes processed on any given atm  including the location of the atm and the amount of time the atm has been installed at that location 
our experience is that the number of transactions on a newly installed atm is initially very low 
it increases over varying periods ranging from three to months after installation  depending upon the market  as consumers become familiar with the location of the machine 
as the atm network has matured  the number of transactions per atm has increased 
we have an ongoing policy of re deploying under performing atms to locations that we believe will result in higher transaction volumes 
we anticipate that future transaction growth at our atms will depend heavily upon increased card issuance in developing markets and continued re deployment of atms to better locations 
we believe that the location of atms is one of the most important factors in determining the success of an atm network 
key target locations for our atms include major shopping malls busy intersections local smaller shopping areas offering grocery stores supermarkets and services where people routinely shop mass transportation hubs  such as city bus and subway stops  rail and bus stations  airports and gas stations tourist and entertainment centers  such as historical sections of cities  cinemas and recreational facilities recognizing that convenience and reliability are principal factors in attracting and retaining atm customers  we are investing in the establishment of advanced atm machines  such as chip card readers and monitoring systems  as well as redundancies to protect against network interruption 
we centrally monitor the performance and cash positions of our atms around the clock  and we dispatch local operations and maintenance contractors to service the machines 
satellite or land based telecommunications lines to our processing centers link our atms in all markets except germany  where we are required to use a german processing company 
outsourced management solutions we offer outsourced management services to banks and other organizations using our processing centers secure electronic financial transaction processing software 
our outsourced management services include management of existing bank networks of atms  development of new atm networks on a complete turn key basis  management of pos networks  management of credit and debit card databases and other financial processing services 
these services include hour monitoring from our processing centers of each individual atm s status and cash condition  coordinating the cash delivery and management of cash levels in the atm and automatic dispatch for necessary service calls 
they also include real time transaction authorization  advanced monitoring  network gateway access  network switching  hour customer services  maintenance services  settlement and reporting 
we already provide these services to existing customers and we have invested in the necessary infrastructure to support many additional transactions 
as a result  any new outsourced management services agreements should provide additional revenue with lower incremental cost 
our outsourced management agreements  other than in germany  generally provide for fixed monthly management fees in addition to fees payable for each transaction 
therefore  the transaction fees under these agreements are generally lower than under card acceptance agreements 
the fees payable under our outsourced management agreements in germany are purely transaction based and include no fixed component 
other products and services our distribution network allows for the sale of financial and other products or services at a low incremental cost 
we have developed value added services in addition to basic cash withdrawal and balance inquiry transactions 
these new services include bill payment  mini statement and recharge purchasing prepaid airtime from atm and mobile phone devices transactions 
we are committed to the ongoing development of innovative new products and services to offer our eft processing customers and intend to implement additional services as markets develop 
in poland  hungary  croatia  romania  the czech republic  the uk  egypt  india and indonesia  we have established electronic connections to some or all of the major mobile phone operators 
these connections permit us to transmit to them electronic requests to recharge mobile phone accounts 
we have either established or adapted networks of atms in these markets to offer customers of the mobile operators the ability to credit their prepaid mobile phone accounts 
we began to distribute prepaid mobile telephone vouchers on our networks in hungary and poland in november in may and october  we added this service to our czech republic and croatian atm networks  respectively 
as of december   we had contracts with mobile operators to use our electronic recharge solutions in various markets 
in poland  hungary  croatia and indonesia  we have contracts with all of the local mobile operators 
in an automatic atm recharge transaction  our atm prompts a consumer through a series of atm screens  during which the customer s credit or debit card is used to make payment for the recharge transaction 
the card transaction is processed and settled to us in the same fashion as a typical atm transaction 
we then send a signal to the mobile operator requesting credit to the customer s account in the amount of the transaction 
the credit takes place automatically and the customer receives a message confirming the transaction 
similarly  our mobile recharge transaction uses the same workflow  but the transaction occurs with screens directly on the mobile phone 
these recharge transactions are similar to the new prepaid processing segment  but since they are transmitted from our atms or mobile phone handsets and proceed through our atm operations center and managed by our atm operations group  they will continue to be reported in the eft processing segment 
our agreements with mobile operators for the non pos recharge business vary in term from one to five years 
they provide for the maintenance of the electronic connection necessary to provide recharge transactions to customers and define operational and commercial terms regarding the method by which we will provide that transaction atm and mobile phone  settlement and the liability for transactions processed 
since  we have been selling advertising on our network 
advertising clients can display their advertisements on the video screens of our atms  on the receipts issued by the atms and on coupons dispensed with cash from the atms 
card acceptance or sponsorship agreements our agreements with banks and international card organizations generally provide that all credit and debit cards issued by the customer bank or organization may be used at all atm machines we operate in a given market 
in many markets  we have agreements with a bank under which we are designated as a service provider which we refer to as sponsorship agreements for the acceptance of cards bearing international logos  such as visa and mastercard 
these card acceptance or sponsorship agreements allow us to receive transaction authorization directly from the card issuing bank or international card organization 
our agreements generally provide for a term of three to seven years and are automatically renewed unless either party provides notice of non renewal prior to the termination date 
in some cases  the agreements are terminable by either party upon six months notice 
we are generally able to connect a bank to our network within to days of signing a card acceptance agreement 
generally  the bank provides the cash needed to complete transactions on the atm  although we have contracted for cash supply with a cash supply bank in the czech republic 
under our card acceptance agreements and many of our outsourced management agreements  we are required to maintain insurance on the cash in the atms 
we also maintain insurance against vandalism and theft of the atms themselves 
insurance costs for atm related risks increased on a per atm basis in as compared with  but have decreased in under our card acceptance agreements  the atm transaction fees we charge vary depending on the type of transaction which are currently cash withdrawals  balance inquiries  wireless airtime recharge purchases  deposits and transactions not completed because authorization is not given by the relevant card issuer and the number of transactions attributable to a particular card issuer 
our agreements generally provide for payment in local currency 
transaction fees are sometimes denominated in us dollars or inflation adjusted 
transaction fees are billed to banks and card organizations with payment terms no longer than one month 
prepaid processing segment overview in  we entered the prepaid mobile phone business through the acquisition of e pay  and began reporting the results of this business in a new segment called the prepaid processing segment in the first quarter of in the second half of  euronet expanded the prepaid processing segment with acquisitions of aim in the us and transact in germany 
for a discussion of revenues  operating profits losses and total assets of the prepaid processing segment during  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note business segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we expanded our prepaid services to poland  ireland and new zealand 
in poland we are deploying pos terminals into polish retailers 
we had deployed approximately devices by december and offer top up services for all the polish mobile operators 
in ireland we have entered into contractual relationships with all the irish mobile operators and offer a top up solution through a significant supermarket chain 
in new zealand we offer services for vodafone new zealand via pos terminals 
all three of these operations use the technology and processing centers in the uk prepaid transaction processing we process pos top up transactions for two types of clients  distributors and retailers  across the nine countries where we currently process pos transactions through retail shops 
both types of client transactions start with a consumer in a merchant shop using an electronic card issued by the mobile phone operator to identify the consumer s mobile phone number 
the consumer uses this card at a specially programmed pos terminal in the shop or the retailer s electronic cash register system that is connected to our network 
the customer will select a predefined amount of prepaid airtime from the carrier of its choice  and the retailer enters the selection into the pos terminal 
the consumer will pay that amount to the retailer in cash or other payment methods accepted by the retailer 
using the electronic connection we maintain with the mobile operator  the purchased amount of airtime will be credited directly to the account of the consumer 
the pos device then transmits the selected transaction to our data center 
one difference in our relationships with various retailers and distributors is in how we charge for our services 
for distributors and certain very large retailers  we charge a processing fee 
however  the majority of our transactions occur with smaller retailer clients 
with these clients  we receive a commission on each transaction which is withheld from the payments made to the mobile operator  and we share that commission with the retailers 
we monitor the number of transactions made on our prepaid network 
total transactions processed by the prepaid processing segment in were million 
this transaction count includes transactions from e pay starting in february  from aim starting in september  and from transact starting in november as of december   the prepaid processing segment processed approximately million electronic prepaid transactions per month at more than  terminals located in approximately  retail locations in the uk  australia  malaysia  indonesia  new zealand  poland  ireland  germany and the us other products and services the convenience offered by electronic purchases is an advantage that can be applied to the distribution of other products and services 
although prepaid mobile airtime is the primary product distributed through our prepaid processing segment  additional products include prepaid long distance calling card plans  prepaid internet plans and prepaid mobile content  such as ring tones and games 
in certain locations  the terminals used for prepaid services can also be used for electronic funds transfer eft to process credit and debit card payments for retail merchandise 
retailer and distibutor contracts we provide our prepaid services over networks installed in retail outlets or  in the case of major retailers  though direct connections to their electronic cash register systems 
the pos terminals or the register systems are connected to our processing centers 
in markets where we operate e pay technology the uk  australia  poland  ireland  new zealand and the uk  we own and maintain the pos terminals 
in germany  the terminals are sold to the retailers or to distributors that service the retailer 
in all cases  we have contracts with the retailers 
our agreements with major retailers for the pos business typically have two year terms 
these agreements include terms regarding the connection of our networks to the respective retailer s registers or payment terminals or the maintenance of pos terminals  and obligations concerning settlement and liability for transactions processed 
generally  our agreements with individual or small retailers regarding the installation and operation of the pos terminals have shorter terms and provide that either party can terminate the agreement upon three months notice and include provisions similar to those with major retailers 
in germany  distributors have historically controlled the sale of mobile phone scratch cards  and they now are key intermediaries in the sale of e top up 
our business in germany is substantially concentrated in and dependent upon relationships with our major distributors 
the termination of any of our agreements with major distributors could materially and adversely affect our business in germany 
however  we are engaged in the process of establishing agreements with independent retailers in order to diversify our exposure to such distributors 
software solutions segment overview through our software solutions segment  we offer an integrated suite of card and retail transaction delivery applications for the ibm iseries platform and some applications on nt server environments 
these applications are generally referred to as euronet software 
the core system of this product  called integrated transaction management itm  provides for transaction identification  transaction routing  security  transaction detail logging  network connections  authorization interfaces and settlement 
front end systems in this product support atm and pos management  telephone banking  internet banking  mobile banking and event messaging 
these systems provide a comprehensive solution for atm  debit or credit card management and bill payment facilities 
we also offer increased functionality to authorize  switch and settle transactions for multiple banks through our goldnet module 
we use goldnet for our own eft requirements  processing transactions across countries in europe 
we have invested significant resources in increasing the delivery capacity for our software solutions and expanding customer service 
we have made further investments in research and development of a number of new electronic and mobile commerce products that should enhance the segment s performance in the future 
we established a customer service center in asia to expand our follow the sun support initiatives  which represent the company s commitment to providing same time zone support for our customers worldwide 
with the addition of the customer support personnel in asia  we have three centers covering emea  the americas and asia pacific 
this coverage presents several benefits to our customers  including immediate access to live technical support  infrastructure expansion to aid in faster problem resolution and a more in depth knowledge and allowance for the uniqueness of conducting business in the various regions 
for a discussion of revenues  operating losses and total assets of the software solutions segment during each of the last three fiscal years  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note business segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
software sales backlog we define software sales backlog as fees specified in contracts which have been executed by us and for which we expect recognition of the related revenue within one year 
at december   the revenue backlog was million  as compared to december   when the revenue backlog was million and at december   when the revenue backlog was million 
we intend to continue to focus on expediting the delivery and implementation of software in an effort to deliver existing backlog sales  while simultaneously replenishing the backlog through continuing product sales growth 
research and development we have made an ongoing commitment to the development  maintenance and enhancement of our products and services 
we regularly engage in research and development activities in each of our business segments aimed at the development and delivery of new products  services and processes to our customers  including bill payment and presentment  telephone and internet banking products  applications for mobile devices  wireless banking products  prepaid mobile phone recharge products and browser based atm software products 
we are also making significant improvements to our core software products 
our research and development costs for software products to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed totaled million for  million for  and million for of these amounts  as of december   million was capitalized and is included on our balance sheet in other long term assets  net of accumulated amortization of million 
these costs were capitalized under our accounting policy requiring the capitalization of development costs on a product by product basis once technological feasibility is established through the completion of a detailed program design or the creation of a working model of the product 
technological feasibility of computer software products is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
see note research and development to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the prior three years research and development capitalized costs and related amortization expense 
financial information by geographic area for a discussion of revenues and long lived assets by geographic location  please see note business segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
technology and processing facilities hardware we use atms from several manufacturers in our atm network 
we are able to purchase atms at contractually defined prices that include quantity discounts 
we also have a long term contract with ncr to provide hardware maintenance and support services for atms from multiple manufacturers in five countries poland  hungary  germany  the czech republic and egypt  which represent of our installed base in europe 
because we operate one of the largest pan european atm networks  we have substantial negotiating leverage with atm manufacturers and we believe we have received favorable pricing for hardware and atm maintenance 
the wide range of advanced technology available from diebold and ncr provides our customers with state of the art electronic features and reliability through sophisticated diagnostics and self testing routines 
our atms are modular and upgradeable so that they can be adapted to provide additional services in response to changing technology and consumer demand 
this allows us to modify our atms to provide new services without replacing our existing network infrastructure 
e pay s pos terminals are primarily acquired from verifone and dione plc 
we find the development environment for these products to be well suited to our services 
we do not have any long term supply agreements with any manufacturer  and we negotiate on an ad hoc basis for our terminal requirements 
the market for terminals is highly competitive  and we believe this manner of procurement is in our best interests 
transact s processing capabilities are hardware independent  enabling their programs to work on most pos terminals 
our preferred hardware vendors for pos terminals are ingenico  trintech and thales 
additionally  transact has designed and developed their own dedicated payment and prepaid terminal that uses pstn  isdn and gprs wireless communication protocols 
we believe the wireless gprs capabilities in transact s pos terminals provide a competitive advantage in the prepaid market by offering a technology that helps in geographical areas where landline phones are poor quality or nonexistent 
gprs also can quickly adapt to different countries requirements  so that we can quickly rollout our solutions into new regions 
we plan to deploy these gprs terminals in other countries where we offer prepaid services  such as poland  and to connect these terminals to our processing center via the internet  enabling real time cross border business 
the transact terminals are developed to meet transact requirements by a german engineering company and manufactured in china 
payspot s pos terminals are primarily acquired from verifone and lipman usa 
we have no long term supply agreements with any manufacturer  and we negotiate on an ad hoc basis for our terminal requirements 
the market for terminals is highly competitive  and we believe this manner of procurement is in our best interests 
telecommunications strong back office central processing support is a critical factor in the successful operation of an atm network 
each atm other than atms in germany is connected to a euronet processing center through satellite or land based telecommunications depending upon physical location  reliability of the communications supplier and cost 
because we strive to ensure very high levels of reliability for our network  we rely primarily on satellite telecommunications to the processing center in budapest for most of our atm connections in central europe 
our budapest processing center is  in most cases  linked by vsat very small aperture terminal telecommunications to the card issuers 
the vsat telecommunications providers generally guarantee uninterrupted service for of the time 
india s atms run on a mix of leased line and vsat connectivity  which all terminate at the bombay data center 
issuer connections consist of direct leased lines  with an isdn component for fail over purposes 
we continually strive to improve the terms of our agreements with our telecommunications providers and have entered into multi country agreements with lower rates for service 
in this regard  new agreements are negotiated periodically with our vsat suppliers  establishing a lower communication cost per atm that takes into account transaction volume growth 
our agreements with our satellite telecommunications providers contain certain assurances with respect to the repair of satellite malfunction to ensure continuous reliable communications for the network 
as the reliability of land based telecommunications improves in the emerging markets where we do business  we may rely more heavily on them because they are generally less expensive than satellite telecommunications 
our e pay operations center uses transaction network services tns that provides fast  cost effective data communication services for transaction oriented applications 
tns proprietary technology has been deployed worldwide 
tns claims to be reliable and claims to have processed over billion transactions worldwide in e pay operates two fully live data centers in the uk and receives transactional traffic from tns via multiple fixed private circuits 
the circuits between e pay and tns are delivered in a diverse routed fashion  which ensures different serving exchanges are used throughout 
inbound traffic is balanced across all available links providing maximum resilience and efficient use of bandwidth 
using this infrastructure e pay is capable of receiving transactions from dial pos solutions pstn  isdn b d channel  host to host  and atms in most countries around the world 
in germany  transact uses its own transaction network connection via pstn  isdn  x  tcp ip and gprs  which is connected to the processing center by t com dual fiber channel access to guarantee reliability higher than 
mirrored server systems and firewall systems provide high availability and transaction security 
in addition to the munich processing center  transact is in the process of commissioning a separate processing center in speyer  germany for backup and standby service 
in the us  payspot dial transactions are delivered via primary rate interface pri interfaces from national telecommunications providers 
the standard interface allows the continual evaluation and ability to migrate to another provider in the highly competitive us telecommunications marketplace 
processing centers our processing centers for the eft processing segment are located in budapest  hungary and mumbai  india 
they are staffed hours a day  seven days a week and consist of production ibm iseries computers  which run the euronet goldnet atm software package 
the budapest operations center has an off site real time back up iseries computer 
the back up system provides high availability in the event of a failure of production iseries computers 
the budapest processing center also includes an iseries computer used for product and connection testing and development

our software is a state of the art software package that conforms to all relevant industry standards and has been installed in at least countries worldwide 
the processing centers computers operate our atms and interface with the local bank and international transaction authorization centers 
to protect against power fluctuations or short term interruptions  both eft processing centers have full uninterruptible power supply systems with battery backup to service the network in case of a power failure 
the processing center s data back up systems are designed to prevent the loss of transaction records due to power failure and permit the orderly shutdown of the switch in an emergency 
the centers also have a diesel powered generator available to supply electrical power to the processing center in the event of a prolonged power outage 
our eft processing centers have been certified by a number of transaction exchange entities  such as visa  link and europay mastercard 
additionally  our eft processing centers are connected to host to host bank and card organizations 
e pay s primary prepaid processing center for the prepaid processing segment is located in basildon  uk it is staffed hours a day  seven days a week  and provides the processing for all of our e top up services in the uk  ireland  poland  new zealand and australia

transact s operations includes the maintenance of different clients networks  hotline and helpdesk and retail billing for eft payment and prepaid business  generated via pos terminals  integrated electronic cash registers ecr and vending based solutions 
for the prepaid services  transact uses third party payment terminals and its own dedicated terminals  fully designed by transact with its own proprietary software connecting via pstn  isdn or gprs communications protocols 
transact s proprietary terminal management system controls the terminal setup  limits and transaction monitoring to control every individual merchant and the settlement risks 
all critical servers are stored in a data safe  which also protects vouchers against fraud or damage 
to protect against power fluctuations or short term interruptions  both of transact s processing centers have full uninterruptible power supply systems with battery backup to service the network in case of a power failure 
the munich operations center is also equipped with a kv diesel powered generator in the event of a prolonged power outage

the centers also have diesel powered generators available to supply electrical power to the processing centers in the event of a prolonged power outage 
competition eft processing segment our principal eft processing competitors include atm networks owned by banks and national switches consisting of consortiums of local banks that provide outsourcing and transaction services only to banks and independent atm deployers in that country 
large  well financed companies that operate atms  such as eds  gtech  first data corporation or global payments may also establish atm networks or offer outsourcing services that compete with us in various markets 
competitive factors in our eft processing segment business include network availability and response time  price to both the bank and to its customers  atm location and access to other networks 
certain independent non bank owned companies provide electronic recharge on atms in individual markets in which we provide this service 
we are not aware of any individual independent companies providing electronic recharge on atms across multiple markets in which we provide this service 
in this area  we believe competition will come principally from the banks providing such services on their own atms through relationships with mobile operators or from card transaction switching networks that add recharge transaction capabilities to their offerings as is the case in the uk through the link network 
prepaid processing segment several companies offer electronic recharge services for mobile phone airtime on pos terminals in the markets where we do business 
these companies include  but are not necessarily limited to  alphyra  paypoint  omega logic  barclays merchant services and anpost in the uk  on q and ezipin in australia  milo  kolporter and gtech in poland  telecash kommunikations service  gzs  adt jalex  anthros and evs in germany  and pre solutions  incomm and everything prepaid in the us we believe  however  that we currently have a competitive advantage due to various factors 
first  in the uk  germany and australia  our acquired subsidiaries have been concentrating on the sale of prepaid airtime for longer than most of our competitors and have significant market share in those markets 
we have approximately of the pos recharge market in the uk  in germany and in australia 
in addition  we offer complementary atm and mobile recharge solutions through our eft processing centers 
we believe this will improve our ability to solicit the use of networks of devices owned by third parties for example  banks and switching networks to deliver recharge services 
in selected developing markets we hope to establish a first to market advantage by rolling out terminals rapidly before competition is established 
we also have an extremely flexible technical platform that enables us to tailor pos solutions to individual merchant and mobile operator requirements where appropriate 
the gprs wireless technology  designed by our transact subsidiary  will also give us an advantage in remote areas where landline phone lines are of lesser quality or nonexistent 
the principal competitive factors in this area include price that is  the level of commission charged for each recharge transaction and up time offered on the system 
major retailers with high volumes are in a position to demand a larger share of the commission  which increases the amount of competition among service providers 
software solutions segment we believe we are the leading supplier of electronic financial transaction processing software for the ibm iseries formerly as platform 
other suppliers service the software requirements of large mainframe systems and unix based platforms 
competitors of the software solutions segment compete across all eft software components in the following areas i atm  network and pos software systems  ii internet banking software systems  iii credit card software systems  iv wireless banking software systems  and v full eft software 
competitors in this segment include applied communications inc aci  mosaic software and oasis software international 
competitive factors in the software solutions business include price  technology development and the ability of software systems to interact with other leading products 
employees our business is highly automated and we outsource many of its specialized  repetitive functions such as atm maintenance and installation  cash delivery and security 
as a result  our labor requirements for operation of the network are relatively modest and are centered on monitoring activities to ensure service quality and cash reconciliation and control 
we also have a customer service department to interface with cardholders to investigate and resolve reported problems in processing transactions 
in our eft processing segment  our rollout of atms  our development of new products and individual bank connections and our expansion into new markets creates a need for qualified staff on many levels 
we require skilled staff to identify desirable locations for atms and negotiate atm lease agreements 
similarly  in our prepaid processing segment  our rollout of prepaid services  development of new products  and expansion into new markets creates a need for qualified staff on many levels 
we require skilled staff to develop and maintain our systems and our operations centers 
in addition  ensuring consistency in quality and approach to new markets as well as proper coordination and administration of our expansion requires skilled staff in the areas of technical operations  financial analysis  project management  human resources  communications  marketing and sales 
we believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to recruit  retain and motivate qualified management  technical and administrative employees 
the success of our software solutions segment business in particular depends upon the ability to hire and retain highly qualified computer engineers and programmers 
as of december   we had employees 
in the first quarter of  we reduced staffing  primarily in little rock and budapest  in a reorganization of our software business 
as a result of this reorganization  we had employees as of december   and employees as of december  due to our growth  the number of our employees has increased to employees as of december  in january  we sold our uk subsidiary and all of the employees of this subsidiary were transferred to the buyer 
in february  we acquired e pay and its employees 
in september  we acquired aim and its employees 
in november  we acquired transact and its employees 
our corporate headquarters is located in leawood  kansas 
our processing centers are located in budapest  london  munich  mumbai  jakarta and kansas city 
we have offices in countries and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
currently  no union represents any of our employees 
we have never experienced any work stoppages or strikes by our workforce 
government regulation we have received advice from banking supervisory authorities or local counsel in certain markets in which we do business to the effect that our business activities in those markets do not constitute financial activities subject to licensing 
any expansion of our activity into areas that are qualified as financial activity under local legislation may subject us to licensing and we may be required to comply with various conditions to obtain such licenses 
moreover  the interpretations of bank regulatory authorities as to the activity we currently conduct might change in the future 
we monitor our business for compliance with applicable laws or regulations regarding financial activities 
under german law  only licensed financial institutions may operate atms in germany 
therefore  we may not operate our own atm network in germany 
in that market  we act only as a subcontractor providing certain atm related services to a sponsor bank 
as a result  our activities in the german market currently are entirely dependent upon the continuance of our agreement with our sponsor bank  or the ability to enter into a similar agreement with another bank in the event of the termination of such agreement 
in january  we entered into a new sponsorship agreement with bankhaus august lenz bal canceling an agreement with diba bank  our previous sponsor bank 
we believe  based on our experience  that we should be able to find a replacement for bal if the agreement with bal is terminated for any reason 
the inability to maintain the bal agreement or to enter into a similar agreement with another bank upon a termination of the bal agreement could have a material adverse effect on our operations in germany 
intellectual property we have registered or applied for registration of our trademarks including the names euronet and bankomat and or the blue diamond logo in most markets in which we use those trademarks 
certain trademark authorities have notified us that they consider the trademarks euronet and bankomat to be generic and therefore not protected by trademark laws 
this determination does not affect our ability to use the euronet trademark in those markets but it would prevent us from stopping other parties from using it in competition with euronet 
we have purchased a registration of the euronet trademark in the class of atm machines in germany  the uk and certain other western european countries 
we have registered the e pay logo trademark in the uk  australia  and malaysia and will be extending such registration as we expand that business to new markets 
we cannot be sure that we will be entitled to use the e pay trademark in any markets other than those in which we have registered the trademark 
other trademarks euronet has registered or has registrations pending in various countries include integrated transaction management  itm  payspot  arksys  cashnet  bank and bank access during and  we filed patent applications for a number of our new software products and our new processing technology  including our recharge services and a browser based atm operating system 
in  we filed a patent application with the us patent office for our pos recharge products in support of e pay and payspot technology 
as of the date of this report  these patents are still pending 
technology in the areas in which we operate is developing very rapidly and we are aware that many other companies have filed patent applications for similar products 
the procedures of the us patent office make it impossible for us to predict whether our patent applications will be approved or will be granted priority dates that are earlier than other patents that have been filed for similar products or services 
if other applicants are granted priority dates that are earlier than ours  and if their patents are considered to cover technology that has been incorporated into our systems  we may be required to obtain licenses and pay royalties to the holders of such patents to continue to use the affected technology or be prohibited from continuing the offering of such services if licenses are not obtained 
this could materially and adversely affect our business

we have processing centers in the us  europe and asia  and process electronic top up transactions at more than  pos terminals across  retailers in europe  asia pacific and the us with corporate headquarters in leawood  kansas  usa  and offices worldwide  euronet serves clients in more than countries 
economic factors  industry factors and risks our company faces certain economic and industry wide factors that could materially affect our business 
as an international company  economic  political  technology infrastructure and legal issues in every country in which we operate could have a positive or negative impact  and therefore are also considered risks 
some of the more significant factors that our management is focused on include the following technological and business developments in the local card  electronic and mobile banking and mobile phone markets affecting transaction and other fees that we are able to charge for our services foreign exchange fluctuations competition from bank owned atm networks  outsource providers of atm services  providers of prepaid mobile phone services and software providers our relationships with our major customers  sponsor banks in various markets  international card organizations and mobile operators  including the risk of contract terminations with major customers changes in laws and regulations affecting our business these risks and other risks are described in exhibit to this form k and our other filings with the sec  which are incorporated herein by reference 
lines of business  geographic locations and principal products and services we operate in three principal business segments in our eft processing segment  we process transactions for a network of  atms across europe and in india 
we provide comprehensive electronic payment solutions consisting of atm network participation  outsourced atm management solutions  and electronic recharge services for prepaid mobile airtime 
through our prepaid processing segment  we provide prepaid processing  or top up services  for prepaid mobile airtime and other prepaid products 
we operate a network of more than  pos terminals providing electronic processing of prepaid mobile phone airtime top up services in the uk  australia  poland  ireland  new zealand  germany  the us  malaysia and indonesia 
through our software solutions segment  we offer a suite of integrated electronic financial transaction eft software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems 
as of december   we had principal offices in europe  four in the asia pacific region  two in the us and one in egypt 
our executive offices are located in leawood  kansas  us sources of revenues and cash flow euronet earns revenues and income based on atm management fees  transaction fees  professional services  software licensing fees and software maintenance agreements 
each business segment s revenue is described further below 
eft processing segment of total segment revenue  for the year ended december  approximately was derived from atms we owned excluding those leased by us in connection with outsourcing agreements as of december  we believe our strategy to shift from a largely proprietary  euronet owned atm network to a greater focus on atms operated under outsourcing agreements will provide higher marginal returns on investments 
on our proprietary network  we generally charge fees for four types of atm transactions that are processed on our atms cash withdrawals balance inquiries transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization prepaid telecommunication recharges transaction fees for cash withdrawals vary from market to market but generally range from to per transaction 
transaction fees for the other three types of transactions are generally substantially less 
we include in eft processing segment revenues transaction fees payable under the electronic recharge solutions that we distribute through our atms 
fees for recharge transactions vary significantly from market to market and are based on the specific prepaid solution and the denomination of prepaid usage purchased 
generally  transaction fees vary from to per prepaid mobile recharge purchase and are shared with the financial institution and the mobile operator 
any or all of these fees may come under pricing pressure in the future 
customer owned atms operated under service agreements require a nominal up front capital investment because we do not purchase the atms 
we typically  but not in all cases  charge a per atm management fee and a transaction fee for each atm managed under our outsourcing agreements 
additionally  in many instances operating costs are the responsibility of the owner and  therefore  recurring operating expenses per atm are lower 
prepaid processing segment the significant growth in the revenue and operating income in our prepaid processing segment is the result of the acquisitions of e pay  transact and aim together with the significant growth rates experienced at each of these businesses 
during  e pay was still establishing contractual relationships with many large and small retailers to distribute mobile top up services through pos terminals 
revenues have grown rapidly over the past year as the level of business at the retailers concerned has ramped up to full realization 
growth in the business is also attributable to the conversion by mobile operators from prepaid top up using scratch card solutions to electronic processing solutions 
we do not expect these growth rate levels to continue 
revenue is recognized based on commissions or processing fees received from mobile and other telecommunication operators or from distributors of prepaid wireless products for the distribution and or processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other telecommunication products 
due to certain provisions of the mobile phone operator agreements  mobile phone operators have the ability to reduce the overall commission paid on each top up transaction 
however  by virtue of our contracts with retailers  not all of these reductions are absorbed by us 
therefore  when mobile phone operators reduce overall commissions  the effect is to reduce revenues and reduce our direct operating costs resulting in only a small impact  if any  on operating income 
in australia  certain retailers negotiate directly with the mobile phone operators for their own commission rates 
our maintenance of agreements with mobile operators is important to the success of our business  because these agreements permit us to distribute top up to the mobile operators customers 
software solutions segment the revenues from the software solutions segment are grouped into four broad categories software license fees are the initial fees we charge to license our proprietary application software to customers we charge professional service fees for providing customization  installation and consulting services to our customers software maintenance fees are the ongoing fees we charge for maintenance of our customers software products hardware sales revenues are derived from the sale of computer products opportunities  challenges and risks our expansion plans and opportunities are focused on three primary areas i our prepaid mobile phone airtime top up processing services  ii outsourced atm management contracts  and iii transactions processed on our network of owned and operated atms 
the continued expansion and development of our atm business will depend on various factors including the following the demand for our atm outsourcing services in our current target markets the ability to develop products or services to drive increase in transactions the expansion of our various business lines in countries where we operate entering into additional card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks the availability of financing for expansion the ability to effectively and efficiently convert atms contracted under newly awarded outsourcing agreements we carefully monitor the revenue and transactional growth of our atm networks in each of our markets  and we adjust our plans depending on local market conditions  such as variations in the transaction fees we receive  competition  overall trends in atm transaction levels and performance of individual atms 
we consistently evaluate and add prospects to our list of potential atm outsource customers 
however  we cannot predict the increase or decrease in the number of atms we manage under outsourcing agreements  because this depends largely on the willingness of banks to enter into outsourcing contracts with us 
banks are very deliberate in negotiating these agreements 
the process of negotiating and entering into outsourcing agreements typically takes nine to months or longer 
banks evaluate a wide range of matters when deciding to choose an outsource vender 
generally  this decision is subject to extensive management analysis and approvals 
in addition  the process is further complicated by the legal and regulatory considerations of local countries as well as local language complexities 
these agreements tend to cover large numbers of atms  so significant increases and decreases in our pool of managed atms could result from signature or termination of these management contracts 
in this regard  the timing of both current and new contract revenues is uncertain and unpredictable 
we plan to expand our prepaid mobile phone top up business  which is currently focused on the uk  germany  the uk  ireland  poland  new zealand and australia  into our other markets by taking advantage of our expertise together with existing relationships with mobile phone operators and retailers 
this expansion will depend on various factors  including the following the ability to negotiate new agreements for other markets with mobile phone operators and retailers the continuation of the trend of increased use of electronic prepaid airtime among mobile phone users the development of mobile phone networks in these markets and the increase in the number of mobile phone users the availability of financing for expansion we expect to spend between million and million on fixed asset purchases to implement our expansion plans and necessary upgrades or modifications of our processing system in we expect to use cash on hand  cash flows from operations and  potentially  lease financing to fund these expenditures 
additionally  in connection with a major atm outsourcing agreement signed in the fall of  we plan to purchase approximately atms from a bank 
simultaneously  we will sell the same atms to an affiliate of that bank  lease back those atms and pass the lease costs through to the bank in accordance with the outsourcing agreement 
we estimate that the value of the acquired sold atms will amount to approximately million 
in addition  our continued expansion may involve acquisitions that could divert our resources and management time and require integration of new assets with our existing networks and services 
our ability to manage effectively our rapid expansion may require us eventually to expand our operating systems and employee base 
an inability to do this could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
inadequate technology and resources would impair our ability to maintain current processing technology and efficiencies as well as deliver new and innovative services to compete in the marketplace

if the effects of the uk atm network sale and related outsourcing agreement were excluded from  s revenues and operating income increased by million  or  and million  respectively 
the increase in over operating income was largely attributable to a increase in transactions processed  an increase in atms under management and expense control management  which more than offset the million in operating income related to the uk atm network operations sold in january the increase in over operating income is primarily due to a increase in transactions processed and a increase in atm s operated

business segment information summary as of december   we operated in three principal business segments the eft processing segment  which includes our proprietary atm network and outsourced management of atms for banks or financial institutions and includes various new processing services we provide for these entities and mobile phone companies through our network of owned and managed atms  such as mobile phone recharge services at the atms

we evaluate performance of our segments based on income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes  foreign exchange gain loss  and minority interest  excluding nonrecurring gains and losses 
all operating amounts  atm counts  transaction numbers and statistics reported in this filing exclude discontinued atm operations in france and the us we have reclassified prior period segment information to conform to the current period s presentation see note business segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
segment revenues and operating income for the years ended december   and revenues operating income loss in thousands in thousands eft processing prepaid processing software solutions corporate services inter segment eliminations total comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and by business segment eft processing segment sale of uk atm network in january  we sold our uk atm network and simultaneously signed an atm outsourcing agreement with the buyer of the network 
we now operate the atms in that network under a five year outsourcing agreement 
with the sale  all employees of that subsidiary were transferred to the buyer 
the results of operations of the uk atm network operations continue to be included in continuing operations due to the ongoing revenues generated by the outsourcing agreement 
in order to provide a more meaningful comparison of the results for the year ended december  to the results for the years ended december  and  we have provided a pro forma schedule below that adjusts the and revenues and expenses to exclude the uk atm network business and include the benefits of the outsourcing agreement as if it were in effect for those periods 
this presentation is consistent with our presentation in the form k filing we made on january  relating to the sale of the uk atm network 
pro forma segment results year ended december  results for the year ended december  in thousands entire segment uk processing adjusted without uk processing entire segment uk processing adjusted without uk processing total revenues direct operating cost salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income loss revenues in our eft processing segment  we generate substantially all our revenue from fees on transactions generated from atms we own and from management fees from atms we operate on an outsourced basis 
we generally charge fees for four types of atm transactions that are processed on our atms cash withdrawals balance inquiries transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization prepaid telecommunication recharges the fees are dependent upon the mix of the following service types atm processing and or monitoring pos terminal driving site selection and lease negotiation cash fill forecasting and or reconciliation first and or second line maintenance insurance communications installation atm leasing our outsourcing services are generally billed on the basis of a fixed monthly fee per atm plus a fee per transaction 
the recurring monthly fees per atm vary significantly depending on the range of services contracted with the customer 
transaction fees for cash withdrawals from atms we own vary from market to market but generally range from to per transaction 
fees for the other three types of transactions are generally substantially less 
we include in eft processing segment revenues from transaction fees payable under the electronic recharge solutions that we distribute through our atms 
fees for recharge transactions vary significantly from market to market and are based on the specific prepaid solution and the denomination of prepaid usage purchased 
generally  transaction fees vary from to per prepaid mobile recharge purchase and are shared with the financial institution and the mobile operator 
any or all of these fees may come under pricing pressure in the future 
total segment revenues decreased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to the sale of the uk atm network 
total segment revenues increased by million or to million for compared to million for  primarily due to increased transactions and atms operated 
as shown in the pro forma segment results  if and uk atm network revenues are excluded and the related outsourcing revenues are included in the comparative amounts due to the sale of the uk atm network  revenues increased for the year ended december  over the year ended december  and for the year ended december  over the year ended december  certain new atm driving contracts and network participation agreements were implemented in the final nine months of and throughout that contributed to transaction and revenue growth 
however  included in revenues for the year ended december  are approximately million in one time revenues for a contract that was terminated before implementation 
increases in atms under management and transactions are the primary reasons for the increase in revenues as further quantified below 
we operated  atms as of december    as of december  and  as of december   representing increases of for and for we processed million  million and million transactions for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing increases of in and in the increase in transaction growth was greater than the increase in atm growth and revenue growth due to an increase in the number of atms that we operate under atm management outsourcing agreements relative to atms we owned during these periods  and an increase in the number of atm network participation arrangements and atm based prepaid telecommunication recharge transactions 
the revenues generated from atm management outsourcing agreements often have a substantial recurring monthly fixed fee as compared to a per transaction fee for our owned atms 
as a result of this relative reduction in transaction based component of fee structures  transactions on these machines increased faster than the revenues 
on december   we owned of the atms we operate excluding those leased by us in connection with outsourcing agreements  while the remaining were operated under atm management outsourcing agreements 
on december   we owned of the atms we managed  including our uk atm network 
of total segment revenue  approximately was from atms we owned excluding those leased by us in connection with outsourcing agreements for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december   as adjusted for the sale of the uk atm network and related outsourcing agreement 
we believe our strategy to shift from a largely proprietary  euronet owned atm network to a more balanced mix between proprietary atms and atms operated under outsourcing agreements will provide higher marginal returns on investments 
customer owned atms operated under service agreements require a nominal up front capital investment because we do not purchase the atms nor do we incur the start up costs typically incurred in the early life cycle of a deployed atm 
additionally  in many instances operating costs are the responsibility of the owner and  therefore  recurring operating expenses per atm are lower 
in the czech republic  beginning in november a new  single intra regional interchange fee for atm cash withdrawals was agreed to by czech issuer banks for both visa and europay cards 
for visa cards  the new fee is and for europay cards the new fee is 
prior to these changes  we were averaging fees of approximately per cash withdrawal in the czech republic 
this intra regional interchange fee had the effect of reducing revenues for our deployed machines in the czech republic by approximately million in additionally  the transactions per atm in the czech republic trended downward during by approximately from the first as compared to the fourth quarters  partially due to the increase in the interchange fee in late as well as certain competitive and other economic conditions 
in  transactions per atm consistently trended above those of and more than offset the revenue decline in we are actively monitoring this trend and will take appropriate action  including deinstallation of any under performing atms  as conditions and further trends warrant to protect deployment margins 
operating expenses for the year ended december   total segment operating expenses decreased  or million  to million from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   total segment operating expenses increased  or million  from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the sale and resulting elimination of the uk atm network expenses in january the primary reason for the increase was additional salaries to support our operational growth during the period 
however  as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses decreased from of revenues in to of revenues in to in  reflecting operational efficiency improvements 
as shown in the eft processing pro forma segment results table  if the uk atm operating expenses are excluded from the comparative figures due to the sale of the uk atm network in january  operating expenses increased  or million  for the year ended december  over the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses is primarily the result of additional expense to support increases in transactions of million  or  and increases in atms of  or 
additionally  salaries increased as a result of resources necessary to support our operational growth during the period  the achievement of certain incentive awards and market development costs in asia 
incentive compensation awards for were approximately million in excess of those achieved in operating expenses in asia were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the following discussion and analysis for the eft processing segment operating expenses and income again compares certain direct operating costs  salaries  selling  general and administrative costs as well as depreciation costs and performance ratios for to and excluding the uk processing business expenses 
we sold the uk atm network in january and thus there are no comparable expenses for the years ended and we believe this presentation provides a more comparable cost structure for analysis of the changes between the periods 
in thousands direct operating costs year ended december  entire segment entire segment uk processing adjusted without uk processing entire segment uk processing adjusted without uk processing atm communication atm cash filling and interest on network cash atm maintenance atm site rental atm installation transaction processing and atm monitoring all other total direct operating expenses direct operating costs decreased from to to of revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a per atm basis  direct operating costs were   and  for december   and  respectively 
this decrease of and increase of for the years ended december  and  respectively  over prior years is primarily due to the increased number of atms combined with an increase in the number of transactions on existing sites that have fixed direct operating expenses due to the move toward outsourcing from ownership 
additionally  in september  the company completed the sale of its hungarian atms 
in connection with the sale  the company entered into a long term outsourcing agreement and cash sponsorship arrangement with the purchaser 
the sale was made to a large financial institution in hungary and resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million that has been offset within direct operating expenses 
costs per transaction have decreased because of increasing transaction volumes at existing sites with a large fixed direct operating cost component at these sites that increase at a slower rate  or not at all  compared to transaction volumes 
on a per transaction basis  annual direct operating costs of for the year declined from the same costs of in and the annual costs of decreased from s costs of 
annual transaction volumes increased and for and  respectively 
increasing transaction volumes on existing sites that have fixed direct operating expenses decreases our costs per atm and per transaction 
in addition  the number of atms that we operate under atm management outsource agreements increased as compared to atms we own and operate 
outsourced atms generally have lower direct operating expenses telecommunications  cash delivery  security  maintenance and site rental because  depending on the customer  our atm management agreements shift some expenses to the customer  which retains certain expense responsibilities that are required to operate the atm 
gross margin per atm was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
gross margin revenue less direct operating costs per transaction was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the continuing increases in gross margin per atm are due to higher growth in transactions and revenues relative to the increases in capital  fixed assets  and direct operating costs 
in fact  certain direct operating expenses such as maintenance  cash fill and supply and telecommunication costs are minimized or eliminated as we migrate toward atm management outsource agreements and away from atm ownership arrangements requiring us  as owner  to bear all these costs 
the slight trend downward in gross margin per transaction is primarily due to the increase in transactions under network sharing arrangements  certain atm management outsourcing agreements and mobile recharge transactions at high volumes and lower than average rates per transaction 
salaries and benefits as a percentage of segment revenue increased from to to of revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
segment salaries and benefits increased million or to million for the year ended december   from million for year ended december  additionally  segment salaries and benefits increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  these increases are primarily due to an increase in staff levels in our asian markets as well as certain incentive compensation related to recent contracts and bonuses for the achievement of certain performance objectives in that were not achieved in selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of segment revenue increased from to to for the years ended december   and  respectively 
segment selling  general and administrative costs increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for year ended december  additionally  segment selling  general and administrative costs increased million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  these increases are primarily due to an increase in market development expenses in our asian business 
also  allocations were made within the euronet operating companies to charge the atm network operations for transaction switching fees and bank connection fees incurred by our central processing center in budapest 
these allocations totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and have been allocated from selling  general and administrative costs to direct operating costs 
finally  in the fourth quarter of we provided approximately million as reserve for a loss on certain atm disbursements resulting from a card association s change in their data exchange format 
we are seeking insurance recovery for this loss 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  or million  to million for year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increase in depreciation of the new computer and system facilities at our european operations center in budapest  which was placed in service in the third quarter of we expect that depreciation levels in the future will grow at slower rates and perhaps even decline as more atms reach the end of their depreciable lives  and we continue to move toward increasing the number of atms that we operate under atm management agreements rather than as owner operators 
operating income the eft processing segment improved operating income by million to million for the year ended december  and by million including the uk atm network business for the year ended december  our operating margin as a percent of revenues was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as shown in the eft processing pro forma segment results table on page  if the uk atm network operating income and expenses are adjusted for the respective balances due to the sale of the uk atm network in january  operating income improved by million for the year ended december  and by million for the year ended december  additionally  operating income as a percent of revenues was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
moreover  operating margin per transaction was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
finally  operating margin per atm was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the continuing increases in operating income as a percent of revenue  per atm and per transaction are due to significant growth in revenues and transactions without corresponding increases in capital  fixed assets  salaries and administrative expenses  as well as the continuing migration toward operating atms under management outsourcing agreements rather that ownership arrangements 
we are pursuing new business opportunities in asia 
in the asia market  operating expenses exceeded revenues by approximately million for the year ended december  and are expected to exceed revenues by approximately million over the next to months as we expand operations 
prepaid processing segment the prepaid processing segment was established in with the acquisition of e pay in february 
later in the year  we acquired aim in september and we acquired transact in november 
our actual results for the prepaid processing segment reflect e pay s results of operations for months  aim s results of operations for four months and transact s results of operations for two months 
to assist in better understanding the results of the prepaid processing segment business since our reported results only include the three acquired business results from the date of acquisition  we have also provided the pro forma results of the prepaid processing segment as if all three acquired businesses had been owned since january  the pro forma results are presented below 
business overview the business of the prepaid processing segment is processing the distribution of prepaid mobile phone minutes  as well as other prepaid products  to consumers through a network of pos terminals and direct connections to the electronic payment systems of retailers 
we enter into agreements with mobile phone operators in certain geographical markets and connect directly to the mobile phone operators back office systems 
in others markets such as the us  we receive mobile phone time through the electronic delivery by mobile operators or the purchase from other sources of phone time through personal identification numbers pins that release airtime to the mobile phone of the customers concerned 
we then distribute the mobile phone time through an electronic network either through a direct credit from the mobile operator to the mobile phone  or the issuance of pins 
the business has grown rapidly over the past year as new retailers have been added and mobile operators have switched from scratch card vouchers to distribution by electronic means 
our prepaid processing segment consists of operations in the us  the us  germany  poland  australia  new zealand and ireland  together with e pay s joint venture in malaysia  which serves the malaysian and indonesian markets 
we maintain contractual relationships with the retailers or networks that operate the pos terminals through which we distribute prepaid mobile airtime 
our agreements with major retailers generally are multiyear agreements  whereas agreements with small retailers are generally terminable on three months notice 
in poland  australia and new zealand  we generally provide the pos terminals free of charge and incur the expense of installing those terminals in the retail outlets 
in the us  germany and ireland the retailers generally pay for the pos terminals 
in the uk  australia  poland  ireland and new zealand  our relations and agreements are directly with the retailers 
in germany  we have relations and agreements directly with retailers and we have transaction processing agreements with distributors 
in these cases the distributors maintain the relationship with the mobile operators and retailers 
in the us  we have both direct and indirect relations with the retailers 
we are attempting to achieve leverage in expanding our network by contracting with distributors or networks of pos or atm terminals generally referred to as independent sales organizations  or iso  which are paid a commission for delivering us contracts with retailers to distribute pins 
as a result of our agreements with isos in the us  our relationships with the retailers are sometimes indirect  through the distributor or iso 
the core of our operations involves the establishing of an electronic connection with the retailers pos terminals  processing transactions and maintaining systems that monitor transaction levels at each terminal 
as consumers purchase mobile phone time  the customer pays the retailer and the retailer becomes obligated to make settlement of the principal amount of the phone time sold 
at e pay  these amounts are deposited in accounts that are held in trust for the mobile operators 
generally speaking  in each market retailer accounts are directly debited on a contractually defined basis 
no trust arrangements are required in markets other than the uk we maintain systems that permit us to monitor the settlement practices of each retailer 
the acquisitions described below  which took place in  initiated this segment of our business 
due to the rapid growth of these new businesses and timing of the acquisitions  the focus of the following discussion and analysis will be on actual financial performance and statistics for the periods that we have owned these subsidiaries 
note acquisition to the consolidated financial statements includes required pro forma consolidated statement of operations summary information for and as if we had purchased the companies as of january  purchase of e pay in february  we purchased of the share capital of e pay  an electronic payments processor of prepaid mobile phone airtime top up services in the uk and australia 
moreover  e pay owns of e pay malaysia  which provides top up services in malaysia and indonesia 
subsequent to our acquisition of e pay  e pay expanded its operations into new zealand  ireland and poland 
e pay processes top up transactions at approximately  points of sale at more than  retail outlets 
this transaction is more fully described under item business and in note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase of aim in september  we purchased all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of aim  a us based electronic top up company  selling prepaid services via pos terminals in states on approximately  pos terminals 
euronet will use aim s resources to enhance the company s us prepaid program  called payspot  which enables consumers to purchase wireless airtime and long distance calling plans from atm and pos terminals across the country 
aim delivers many types of prepaid products  including wireless  long distance  gift cards  debit cards and other products 
this transaction is more fully described under item business and in note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase of transact in november  we purchased of the shares of transact 
transact specializes in payment processing services and software for electronic financial transactions and prepaid mobile phone transactions 
additionally  transact offers a line of proprietary pos terminals  including general packet radio system gprs based products 
transact currently supports mobile phone top up purchases at more than  of their installed base of over  pos terminals in approximately  retail locations 
this transaction is more fully described under item business acquisitions and in note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
the prepaid processing segment now supports top up transactions at approximately  points of sale in  locations across nine countries 
the following table presents the results of operations for this segment for the year ended december  as included in our consolidated results of operations  as well as pro forma results of operations for and as if we owned all acquired businesses as of january  prepaid processing segment results of operations in thousands as reported year ended december  pro forma year ended december  pro forma year ended december  unaudited unaudited total revenues direct operating cost salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income pro forma year over year results the year over year pro forma results for the prepaid processing segment presented above reflect significant growth 
this growth was predominately from e pay in the uk and australia 
both the uk and australian mobile operators were among the first markets to aggressively promote the use of electronic top up products in favor over of card products 
accordingly  e pay was able to benefit significantly from their actions 
moreover  e pay benefited from strong sales in both and  during which time it was successful in signing e top up distribution agreements with several major uk and australian retailers 
e pay benefited in by the full year effects of retailer agreements signed and implemented in the direct operating expense generally grew at rates similar to the revenue growth as expected 
all other operating expenses  in aggregate  increased year over year by approximately of the revenue growth  reflecting the significant leverage of a largely fixed cost structure 
revenues the prepaid processing segment s revenues of million reflected consistent and strong sequential quarterly growth throughout revenues for the first quarter  the initial quarter of the prepaid processing segment  grew on a pro forma basis over the fourth quarter  the second quarter grew over the first quarter s pro forma revenues  the third quarter grew over the second quarter and the fourth quarter grew over the third quarter if the results of transact and aim were excluded 
these strong sequential growth rates were the result of several factors including the mobile operators continued shifting from scratch card solutions to electronic top up solutions  the full year effects of retailer agreements implemented in  the signing and implementation in of additional retailer agreements  principally larger retailers  the launch of prepaid business operations in new zealand  ireland and poland  the late third quarter acquisition of aim and fourth quarter acquisition of transact 
included in the fourth quarter revenues was million and million in revenues from the acquisitions of aim and transact  respectively 
we do not expect these growth rates to continue 
revenue is recognized based on commissions received from mobile and other telecommunication operators or transaction processing fees from prepaid wireless top up distributors or large retailers for the distribution and or processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other telecommunication products 
due to certain provisions of the mobile phone operator agreements  mobile phone operators have the ability to reduce the overall commission paid on each top up transaction 
however  by virtue of our contracts with retailers  not all of these reductions are absorbed by euronet 
therefore  when mobile phone operators reduce overall commissions  the effect is to reduce revenues and direct costs with only a small  if any  impact on operating income 
in australia certain retailers negotiate directly with the mobile phone operators for their own commission rates 
approximately of the prepaid processing segment s revenue is attributable to the processing of prepaid mobile airtime and is attributable to other telecommunications products 
we distribute small amounts of long distance prepaid phone time in the us  uk and australia  and we expect to continue to do so 
as other telecommunications and prepaid products are introduced  this mix is expected to change 
total transactions processed by the prepaid processing segment for the months ended december  were million  including million in the fourth quarter and million in the third quarter revenue and gross margin per transaction averaged and  respectively  during the period ended december  revenue per transaction in the uk have trended slightly downward  primarily due to the reduction of commission rates paid by the mobile operators in the uk gross margin per transaction trended slightly downward throughout the year primarily as a result of transactional volume growth from existing larger retailers together with additional agreements signed this year with large retailers who earn discounts consistent with higher transaction volumes 
transaction growth in the uk is expected to slow in the next to months as a result of our current association with nearly all of the larger retail merchants and as the conversion to electronic top up from scratch card vouchers begins to slow 
new markets in poland  germany  ireland  new zealand and the us are expected to experience higher transaction growth rates than the uk as the conversion to electronic top up from scratch card vouchers increases 
operating expenses direct operating expenses in the prepaid processing segment include the commissions we pay to retail merchants for the distribution and sale of prepaid mobile airtime and other prepaid products 
these expenditures vary directly with processed transactions 
communication and paper expenses required to operate terminals are also included 
direct operating expenses were million or of revenue  for the month period ended december  higher transaction volumes and related commission expense directly attributable to increase in revenue was the primary reason for the continuing increase in direct operating expenses 
costs per transaction have increased slightly as a result of certain new contracts with large retail merchants who have contributed to transaction growth but at a higher commission cost to e pay 
segment salaries and benefits were million  or  of revenues for the months ended december  new hires necessary to staff expansion into new markets in poland  new zealand  and the us added million to the total salary and benefit expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenues for the eleven months ended december  of this amount  million is due to new market development and operational expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the months ended december  this amount includes million in amortization expense for assigned intangible assets related to the acquisitions 
operating income operating income of million consistently increased throughout the month period ended december  the increases are directly attributable to increased revenue volume 
the prepaid processing segment s operating income benefited from the ability to leverage its operations in that its non direct operating costs are generally fixed or discretionary in nature rather than variable with volume 
we would generally expect to see this relationship continue 
software solutions segment a comparative summary of the statement of operations for the software solutions segment is presented below 
year ended december  software solutions in thousands total revenues direct operating cost salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income loss revenue software revenues are grouped into four broad categories as shown in the table below 
software license fees are the initial fees we charge to license our proprietary application software to customers 
we charge professional service fees for providing customization  installation and consultation services to our customers 
software maintenance fees are the ongoing fees we charge for maintenance of our customers software products 
hardware sales revenue is derived from the sale of computer products 
the components of software solutions segment revenue were year ended december  software solutions in thousands software license fees professional service fees maintenance fees hardware sales total total software revenues decreased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   and increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  these year over year changes are largely the result of recognizing million in revenues from the sale of a licensing and maintenance agreement referred to as fidelity national financial  or fnf  formerly alltel information systems to a customer in the year  only million was recognized in the year ended december  from that some customer 
the current year decrease over the prior year is generally in line with expectations for this segment due to the impact of s significant customer sale offset by an increase in professional service fees 
software license fees decreased million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  software license fees increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in the year ending december  is due primarily to license fees that we earned as part of a software license agreement with fnf during we recognized million in software license fees related to the fnf software license agreement during the year ended december   compared to million in software license fees for the year ended december  approximately million of license fees remain to be earned and recognized related to the fnf software license agreement 
in this particular license agreement  there is no specific date by which the services related to these fees must be utilized 
excluding the fnf license fees  software license fees increased million for the year ended december   resulting from increased license agreements being signed during professional service fees increased million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  professional services fees decreased million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the current year increase is due to strong sales efforts and additional billed hours of service and consulting over the same period a year earlier 
this is primarily due to a redeployment of resources from the fnf software license agreement to other professional service contracts 
maintenance fees increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  maintenance fees increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  each year s increase in maintenance fees is due to the completion of software delivery contracts  thereby initiating the maintenance aspect of these contracts 
the fnf software license agreement resulted in the inclusion of approximately million in maintenance revenues for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  hardware sales are generally sporadic as they are an incidental component to our software license and professional services offerings 
hardware sales increased marginally for the year ended december  compared to the same period ended december  software sales backlog we define software sales backlog as fees specified in contracts that we have executed and for which we expect recognition of the related revenue within one year 
at december   the revenue backlog was million as compared to december  when the revenue backlog was million and to december  when the revenue backlog was million 
the fnf software license agreement represented million of the december  backlog 
strong sales in and have enabled us to largely replace the fnf license agreement within our backlog 
we provide no assurance that the contracts included in our backlog will actually generate the specified revenues or that the revenues will be generated within the one year period 
operating expenses software solutions segment operating expenses are grouped into four categories as shown in the table above 
direct operating costs consist of hardware costs and distributor commissions 
hardware costs are generally sporadic as they are an incidental component to our software license and professional services offerings 
direct operating costs increased or million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  direct operating costs increased  or million  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase from to is a result of increased distributor commissions and hardware sales 
we continue to pursue strategic distributor relationships for the sale of our software products 
these relationships provide an avenue for efficient sales of our products to customers or in geographic regions that may otherwise be inaccessible 
salary and benefits decreased by million  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  salary and benefits decreased by million  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  these reductions are generally due to reduced resource commitments for certain development and professional service fee contracts  as well as to an increase in capitalization of salaries for software development costs for our credit card and us based prepaid processing software 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  to million  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to reduced expenses in related to the renegotiation of certain telecommunication contracts as well as expense control efforts 
these decreases are not expected to continue 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december   and to million for the year ended december  the increases are due to the addition of million in capitalized software development costs during  and million in capitalized software development costs along with million in leasehold improvements during amortization of capitalized software development costs was million for the year ended december  and million including leasehold improvements for the year ended december  we continue our ongoing commitment to the development  maintenance and enhancement of our products and services 
in particular  we invested and will continue to invest in new software products that permit additional features and transactions on our atm network 
in addition  we continue to invest in the ongoing development of products that were recently introduced to the market 
our research and development costs for software products to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed were million for the year ended december  and million for the same period ending december  we capitalize software development costs in accordance with our accounting policy of capitalizing development costs on a product by product basis once technological feasibility is established 
we establish technological feasibility of computer software products when we complete all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
we capitalized million in the year ended december   as compared to million capitalized during the year ended december  and compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  operating income the software solutions segment reported operating income of million for the year ended december  as compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  the improvements are primarily due to a revenue increase together with reductions in salaries and benefits expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
corporate services segment in thousands year ending december  salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total direct operating expenses operating expenses for the corporate services segment increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and operating expenses decreased by million to million for compared to million for the increase in is largely attributable to the achievement of performance bonuses in that were not achieved in coupled with increased insurance costs and cost related to certain additional staffing added in the second half of cost control measures and work force reductions implemented in that became fully realized in are the primary reasons for the decrease operating expenses in compared to additionally  in january we began to reclassify certain salary and benefits expense to the eft processing segment to better reflect the actual job responsibilities performed 
the effect of these changes is fully realized in non operating results interest income interest income increased by million to million for the year ended december  from approximately million for each of the years ended december  and the increase is the result of interest earned on restricted cash with respect to the administration of customer collection and vendor remittance activities of the prepaid processing segment  which was added in interest expense interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase of million in interest related to the senior discount notes resulting from a weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro during as well as million of interest on indebtedness incurred for the acquisition of e pay 
this increase was substantially offset by the reduction in interest expense as a result of the full year effect of a million cash redemption of our euro denominated senior discount notes made in july as well as net reductions in capital lease obligations of million 
interest expense decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease from to was due to a reduction in notes payable as a result of significant debt equity swaps during and the cash retirement of million in july offset partially by exchange rate differences 
in february  we incurred approximately million million gbp of indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of e pay  which is more fully described in note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
the e pay debt was reduced to million through payments and equity conversions through december  gain on sale of uk atm network in january  we sold of the shares in our uk subsidiary for million 
concurrently with this sale  we signed a services agreement with the buyer whereby the eft processing segment will provide atm operating  monitoring and transaction processing services to the buyer through december  as a result of this sale  we recognized a gain on the sale of million and deferred the recognition of million in revenue  which will be recognized ratably over the five year service agreement  in we recognized million of this revenue in the eft processing segment s revenue 
moreover  we recognized no tax expense on this sale as a result of the favorable treatment of such gains between the netherlands  where the parent of the uk subsidiary is incorporated  and the uk the uk s results continue to be included in continuing operations due the ongoing outsourcing revenues as well as those deferred 
loss on facility sublease we incurred a loss of million in related to the sublease of excess office space 
we subleased approximately  square feet in august to an unrelated third party under a non cancelable sublease agreement at lease rates lower than those being paid by euronet for the space 
equity in income and losses from equity investments we recorded million in equity income in as a result of our share of e pay s net income in e pay malaysia 
in addition  we incurred a loss of million in and a loss of million in resulting from our share of losses of cashnet egypt 
gain loss on early retirement of debt we had no early retirements of debt in we had a loss on early retirement of debt of million for compared to a gain on early retirement of debt of million for the gain was the result of repurchasing notes payable as amounts significantly below their carrying value as described in note notes payable to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange gain loss we had a net foreign exchange loss of million for as compared to an exchange loss of million for and an exchange gain of million for exchange gains and losses that result from re measurement of certain assets and liabilities are recorded in determining net income or loss 
a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in the euro and british pounds  and other currencies  including capital lease obligations  notes payable including the notes issued in our public bond offering  cash and cash equivalents  and investments 
the significant loss of value of the us dollar against the euro is the primary source of the loss in and the strengthening of the us dollar against these currencies is the primary source of the gain in it is our policy to attempt to match local currency receivables and payables 
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities give rise to foreign exchange gains and losses as a result of us dollar to local currency exchange movements 
income taxes tax expense on income from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  as compared to a tax benefit of million for the tax expense is comprised of million in tax expense related to the prepaid processing segment  million in tax expense related to the eft processing segment  and million in tax benefit related to corporate 
taxable income is now being generated in several tax jurisdictions within these business segments 
the income tax benefit for was primarily the result of utilizing us tax loss carryforwards generated in prior years to offset the taxable gain resulting from the dash sale  as well as the recognition of deferred tax benefits from foreign tax loss carryforwards anticipated to be utilized over the subsequent two years 
minority interest we recorded the minority interest in losses from p 
t 
euronet sigma nusantara  an indonesia company 
we own of p 
t 
euronet sigma nusantara s shares 
discontinued operations in january  we sold substantially all of the dash assets to fnf formerly alltel information systems for million in cash 
we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million related to this transaction 
we reported income net of tax from the discontinued operations of dash of million in including the gain on sale and million in in july  we sold substantially all of the non current assets and capital lease obligations of our processing business in france to atos origin  sa for euro plus reimbursement of certain operating expenses 
a pre tax loss on disposal of the france business of million was recorded in we reported a loss net of tax from the discontinued operations of france of nil in including the loss on sale and a loss of million in as a result of the above  we have removed the operating results of france and dash from continuing operations for all reported periods in accordance with sfas net income loss we recorded a net income of million for as compared to a net loss of million for and a net income of million for in summary  s net income of million was largely the result of million in operating income increased by the million gain on the sale of the uk atm network and million in equity from unconsolidated subsidiaries offset by interest expense net of interest income of million  tax expense of million and foreign exchange losses of million 
for the year  the net loss of million was mostly the net result of losses from operations of million increased by interest expense of million  net of interest income  loss on early retirement of debt of million and foreign exchange losses of million offset by income from discontinued operations of million and million in income tax benefits 
for the year  the net income of million was largely the net effect of million in operating losses increased by interest expense net of interest income of million offset by a gain of million on the early retirement of debt  foreign exchange gains of million and income tax benefits of million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million of restricted cash of which million is cash held in trust and or cash held on behalf of others in connection with the administration of the customer collection and vendor remittance activities in the prepaid processing segment 
the remaining restricted cash is cash provided by banks participating in our atm network  cash pledged to cover guarantees on financial instruments and as deposits with customs officials see note restricted cash to the consolidated financial statements 
prior to  we had negative cash flow from operations 
we funded operations and capital expenditures through proceeds from debt and equity offerings as well as through capital lease financings 
as more fully described previously  we funded the recent acquisitions of e pay  aim and transact with combinations of cash  debt and equity  approximately million of such cash come from the sale of the uk atm network 
in december  we entered into a secured revolving agreement the bank credit agreement providing a facility of up to million from a bank 
the bank credit agreement expired on march  and was repaid in full at that time 
in february  we entered into a two year unsecured revolving credit agreement with a bank to provide for borrowing up to million 
the proceeds from the facility can be used for working capital needs  acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
there are certain financial performance covenants that must be maintained under the agreement and limitations on payment of dividends 
interest accrues on any outstanding balances at a prime based floating rate or libor based rate for day periods 
as of march   no amounts had been drawn under this agreement 
due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro throughout  the amount of our long term senior discount notes outstanding has increased from million at december  to million at december  we commenced cash payments of interest on our senior discount notes on january  and are required to continue to make such payments on a semi annual basis on january and july through at current debt levels  we will be required to make approximately million million at an exchange rate of dollars to the euro in interest payments on a semi annual basis through the remaining principal balance of senior discount notes of approximately million carrying value approximately million will be due and payable in july since july   we may at any time exercise our right to partially or fully redeem the senior discount notes for cash without restriction 
any redemption is subject to an early redemption premium as defined in the senior discount notes indenture 
the early redemption premium decreases throughout the term of the senior discount notes 
on july   the early redemption premium stepped down to  then decreases to on july  and no premium from july  and thereafter 
we intend to reduce our indebtedness under our senior discount notes through the repurchase of notes from time to time in exchange for equity as we have done in the past and or through repayments as our cash flows permit 
in the event we are not able to exchange debt for equity or repay the debt through cash flows  we will attempt to refinance this debt to decrease interest costs and  if possible  extend its repayment period if reasonable terms are available 
our current cash flow levels would be sufficient to make the semi annual interest payments and  if maintained  would be sufficient to repay the majority of this debt at maturity 
we expect our cash flows to increase sufficiently to permit full repayment of this debt when it falls due 
however  we can make no assurances as to our ability to sustain or increase our cash flows 
we also incurred indebtedness in the aggregate amount of approximately million in connection with our acquisitions of e pay  transact  aim and  subsequent to december   precept 
since incurring this indebtedness in  we have either repaid or converted to equity approximately million  leaving million yet to repay 
starting in april  we are obligated to repay approximately per quarter for three quarters 
in january  we are obligated to repay million and in february  we are obligated to repay million gbp  or approximately million 
the million due in january can be repaid in cash or euronet stock at a discount to the defined current market price 
in addition to these indebtedness obligations  we agreed with the selling shareholders of transact to make an earn out payment to them in january for the growth of the transact business as determined in the third quarter of based on transact s business plan  for which we can make no assurances as to its achievement  we estimate that the second payment will be approximately million to million 
we have the right to make that payment in all cash or half in cash and half in shares of our common stock 
in november  when we raised million in cash through the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock to fletcher international  ltd 
fletcher  we agreed to allow fletcher the right to invest an additional million in our common stock at the prevailing market price at the time fletcher may exercise its right 
we cannot force fletcher to make the additional investment and fletcher has months from march   subject to certain extensions  to make the additional investment 
if fletcher does exercise its additional investment right  we anticipate that we would use the proceeds to reduce our debt obligations or for other purposes that may develop in the future 
in the eft processing segment  we lease many of our atms under capital lease arrangements that expire between and the leases bear interest between and per year 
as of december   we owed million under these capital lease arrangements 
we expect that our capital requirements will continue in the future  although our strategy to focus on atm outsourcing opportunities rather than atm ownership and deployment as well as redeployment of under performing atms will reduce capital requirements 
in the prepaid processing segment  we own approximately  of the  pos devices that we operate  with the remaining terminals being operated as integrated cash register devices of our major retail customers or owned by the retailers 
as the prepaid processing segment s business expands  we will continue to add terminals in certain independent retail locations at a price of approximately per terminal 
we expect the proportion of owned terminals to remain at a similar percent of total terminals operated 
we are required to maintain atm hardware and software in accordance with certain regulations and mandates established by local country regulatory and administrative bodies as well as europay  mastercard and visa emv 
accordingly  we expect additional capital expenditures over the next few years to maintain compliance with these regulations and or mandates 
upgrades to our atm software and hardware will be required in to meet emv mandates such as triple des data encryption standard and micro chip card technology for smart cards 
we initiated a plan for implementation and delivery of the hardware and software modifications  we estimate that outsourcing our capital expenditures necessary to meet these upgrade requirements will be approximately million to million 
we anticipate meeting this obligation through cash flows or capital lease transactions 
capital expenditures  including fixed assets  capital leases and purchased and capitalized internally developed software  for were million  million for and million for the reductions in capital expenditures in compared to generally related to our strategy shift from owning atms to managing atms on an outsourced basis 
in and we were increasing the number of atms we independently owned and operated 
in addition  in we commissioned our new eft processing data center in budapest  hungary as well as the alternative business interruption center in budapest 
in  we had neither the data centers nor the build out of atms in new or in existing markets for capital expenditure requirements 
the benefits of these lower capital expenditure requirements in was partially offset by increased levels of capitalized internally developed software costs together with the purchase of pos terminals in our prepaid processing segment 
capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately to million 
this increase is largely driven by the purchase of approximately atms from a bank for approximately million in relation to the signing of a multi year atm outsourcing agreement and approximately to million related the emv chip card upgrades previously discussed 
with respect to the purchase of the atms  our agreement with the bank provides for a simultaneous atm sale leaseback transaction with a leasing entity affiliated with the bank 
the cost of the lease will be charged back to the bank customer 
our agreement further provides that in the event we or the bank terminates the atm outsourcing agreement for any reason  the obligations under the lease agreement will automatically terminate and the atms revert back to the affiliated entity with no remaining obligation to us 
with respect to the remaining capital expenditures  we anticipate that we will fund their purchases under lease terms acceptable to us or with cash 
at current and projected cash flow levels together with cash on hand and amounts available under our recently signed revolving credit agreement  we anticipate that our cash will be sufficient to meet our debt  leasing and capital expenditure obligations 
if our cash is insufficient to meet these obligations  we will seek to refinance this debt 
however  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain favorable terms for the refinancing of any of the debt or obligations described above 
effective july   we implemented our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  under which employees have the opportunity to purchase common stock through payroll deductions according to specific eligibility and participation requirements 
this plan qualifies as an employee stock purchase plan under section of the internal revenue code of we completed a series of offerings of three months duration with new offerings commencing at the beginning of each quarter 
under the plan  participating employees are granted options  which immediately vest and are automatically exercised on the final date of the respective offering period 
the exercise price of common stock options purchased is the lesser of of the fair market value as defined in the espp of the shares on the first day of each offering or the last date of each offering 
the options are funded by participating employees payroll deductions or cash payments 
under the provisions of the espp  we reserved  shares of common stock all of which we had issued as of december  in february  we adopted a new espp and reserved  shares of common stock for issuance under that plan 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares at an average price of per share  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million 
in  we made matching contributions of  shares of stock in conjunction with our k employee benefits plan for the plan year under the terms of this plan  employer matching contributions consist of two parts  referred to as basic and discretionary 
the basic matching contribution is equal to of eligible employee elective salary deferrals between and of participating employee salaries for the plan year 
the discretionary matching contribution is determined by our board of directors for a plan year and is allocated in proportion to employee elective deferrals 
as of december   total employer matching contributions since inception of the plan has consisted of  shares under the basic match and  shares under the discretionary matching contribution 
we made employer matching contributions of  shares under the plan for plan year in february see note employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements 
operating cash flows operating cash flows increased million in and million in the increase was primarily due to operating cash flows from e pay  acquired in february the increase was due to the growth in the eft segment due to a increase in the number of atms 
we expect continued increases in cash flow from operations as our business grows 
investing activity cash flow cash flows from investing activities increased million in and million in the increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of e pay  transact and aim  requiring approximately million in cash  offset by the sale of the uk atm network providing million in net cash proceeds 
the increase was due to increased fixed asset purchases for the expansion of the eft atm network and the budapest atm processing center 
financing activity cash flows cash flows from financing activities increased million in and decreased million in the increase resulted from an increase in proceeds from the issuance of equity and borrowings of million combined with a decrease in notes payable and capital lease repayments of million 
the decrease was due to an increase in notes payable and capital lease repayments of offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of equity and borrowings of million 
we expect continued increases in cash flow from operations as our business grows 
financing and investing sources and uses of cash in the future are primarily dependent on our acquisition of new businesses and the related financing needs 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet items we have no significant off balance sheet items see note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
we entered into two acquisition agreements in that include obligations to make additional payments to the sellers based upon the future performance of the businesses acquired 
in the agreement for the acquisition of the assets of aim  we agreed to make additional payments up to million over a two year period ending september  subject to certain performance criteria 
the obligation is payable in our common stock valued at fair market value on the date of payment 
in the agreement for the acquisitions of shares of transact  we agreed to make an additional payment in january based on the ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of transact for the third quarter  we estimate  based on transact s business plan  that the second payment will be approximately to million 
this amount may be paid all in cash or half in cash and half in our common stock 
we have recorded no amounts related to future contingent liabilities 
we can offer no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain financing to meet these obligations when due 
see note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of these acquisitions 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years senior notes including interest capital leases including interest operating leases purchase obligations total for additional information on each of these items  see note notes payable and note leases to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include contractual amounts for atm maintenance  cleaning  telecommunication and cash replenishment operating expenses 
while contractual payments may be greater or less based on the number of atms and transaction levels  purchase obligations listed above are estimated based on current levels of such business activity 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note summary of significant accounting policies and practices to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are used for collectibility of accounts receivable  software revenue recognition  purchase price allocation of fair value in acquisitions to customer relationships and other intangible assets  income taxes  intangible assets and their related lives  and impairment of long lived assets  goodwill  and contingency accruals for atm theft and vandalism 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
software revenue recognition revenues from software licensing agreement contracts are recognized over the contract term using the percentage of completion method based on the percentage of hourly services that are provided compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract 
certain judgments are necessary in determining the level of project completion 
revenue from time and material service contracts is recognized as the services are provided 
revenues from software licensing contracts representing newly released products deemed to have a higher than normal risk of failure due to unproven technology or implementation complexity are recognized on a completed contract basis whereby revenues and related costs are deferred until the contract is complete 
maintenance revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed 
revenue in excess of billings on software licensing contracts is recorded as unbilled receivables and is included in current assets 
billings in excess of revenue on software licensing contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and included in current liabilities until such time the above revenue recognition criteria are met 
accounting for income taxes deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the liability method 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment 
the income statement effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes  net of valuation allowances  on the balance sheet as measured by differences in the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we have significant tax loss carryforwards and other temporary differences  which are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets realizable in future periods are recorded  net of a valuation allowance based on an assessment of each entity or group of entities ability to generate sufficient taxable income within an appropriate period in a specific tax jurisdiction 
in assessing the recognition of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as more fully described in note taxes to the consolidated financial statements  gross deferred tax assets were million as of december   substantially offset by a valuation allowance of million 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we make judgments and estimates on the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and current projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowance at december  as requisite history of taxable income is established in certain of the countries in which we operate and baseline forecasts project continued taxable income in these countries  we will reduce the valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that will be considered realizable 
estimating the impairment of long lived assets we are required to evaluate long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to projected undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets on a discounted cash flow basis 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future adverse changes in market conditions could result in an inability to recover the carrying amount of an asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill and other intangible assets we apply sfas in accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the amortization and non amortization provisions of sfas apply upon issuance to all goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   we adopted sfas effective january  in accordance with sfas  we have completed the impairment tests and determined that there is no impairment of the intangible assets as recorded in our financial statements 
the majority of goodwill is reported in the prepaid processing segment and a smaller amount in the eft processing reporting unit 
in determining the recoverability of intangible assets  certain judgments and assumptions are necessary to determine the forecasted cash flow of the business reporting unit 
additionally  judgment is used in determining lives and values of certain amortizable intangible assets 
for larger acquisitions we utilized an independent appraiser to assist in these judgments 
subsequent events acquisition of prepaid concepts  inc on january   we purchased of the shares of precept  a company based in california 
precept provides services related to the distribution of prepaid telecommunications products in the us  including the electronic distribution of prepaid products through point of sale terminals in retail outlets 
precept processes transactions at approximately  retail locations and distributes prepaid products for all the major wireless carriers in the us  as well as several regional carriers 
the purchase price for the precept shares was approximately million 
we paid million in cash  issued promissory notes in the original principal amount of million and issued  shares of our common stock for the precept shares 
of the issued shares of our common stock   shares will be held in escrow and released on february   subject to certain performance criteria 
of the million in promissory notes  million are convertible into shares of our common stock as described more fully below deferred purchase price in the amount of million  bearing interest at an annual rate of and payable october  principal payments are payable in three installments on april   july  and october indebtedness of million under promissory notes bearing interest at an annual rate of  with accrued interest payable at maturity on february  we have the option to pay the principal and interest at maturity in shares of our common stock valued at a discount to the average market price for trading days prior to the maturity date 
in addition  at any time prior to the maturity date  the amount outstanding under these notes is convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the holders  based upon a conversion price of per share 
all of the amounts described above are consideration amounts as included in the acquisition agreement and may differ from the consideration determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
any differences would relate to the value placed on the shares exchanged 
us gaap requires the use of a publicly traded quoted market value of the shares three days before and three days after the announcement of the transaction whereas the purchase price set forth above was based on a value per share as agreed to between the buyer and the seller 
we agreed to file with the sec a registration statement to enable the public resale of the common stock received by the former shareholders of precept and that registration statement was declared effective by the sec in february new revolving credit agreement in february  we entered into a two year unsecured revolving credit agreement providing a facility of up to million with a bank 
the proceeds from the facility can be used for working capital needs  acquisitions  and other corporate purposes 
there are certain financial performance covenants that must be maintained under that agreement 
interest accrues on any balances outstanding at a prime based floating rate or libor based rates for day periods 
as of march   no funds had been drawn under the facility 
balance sheet items cash and cash equivalents the increase of cash and cash equivalents to million at december  from million at december  is due primarily to the following activity cash flow from operations of million additional cash borrowings of million net proceeds from the disposition of the uk atm network and other fixed assets of million net proceeds from stock issuances  exercise of stock options  warrants and employee share purchases of million offset by cash investments in the acquisition of our three new prepaid processing segment businesses of million purchase of million of fixed assets and other long term assets debt and lease repayments of million restricted cash restricted cash increased to million at december  from million at december  of that amount million of the increase is cash held in trust and or cash held on behalf of others in connection with the administration of the customer collection and vendor remittance activities in the prepaid processing segment 
amounts collected from mobile operators are deposited into a restricted cash account 
the remaining increase in restricted cash is with respect to cash that is held as collateral for standby letters of credit in support of our atm operations 
trade accounts receivable trade accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to the acquisition of e pay in february approximately million represented the trade accounts receivable of our prepaid processing segment  which related to the administration of customer collection and vendor remittance activities 
assets held for sale assets held for sale represent the net assets of our uk subsidiary as of december  substantially all of france s and dash s assets were sold in as discussed in note discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements 
our uk subsidiary was sold in january as discussed in note gain on disposition of uk atm network 
property  plant and equipment net property  plant and equipment decreased to million at december  compared to million december  this net decrease of million was due to net purchases of million  net acquisition additions of million  foreign exchange increases of million  offset by net disposals of million and depreciation of million 
intangible assets and goodwill net intangible assets increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in intangible assets is principally due to intangible assets related to the acquisitions of e pay  aim and transact 
in accordance with sfas  we no longer amortize goodwill but review goodwill and intangible assets at least annually for possible impairment 
the following table summarizes our intangible assets as of december  amortizable intangible assets goodwill total intangible assets intangible assets related to german acquisition of atms acquisition of e pay acquisition of aim acquisition of transact total deferred tax assets current deferred tax assets increased to million at december  from nil at december  the increase is primarily due to i the reclassification of certain non current deferred tax assets to current  ii deferred tax assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of e pay  iii the release of valuation allowances on previously unrecognized deferred tax assets from net operating losses and other temporary differences for certain entities and iv the recognition of other current deferred tax assets generated in those entities during long term deferred tax assets decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease is primarily due to the reclassification of certain long term deferred tax assets to current  offset partially by the release of valuation allowances on previously unrecognized long term deferred tax assets for certain entities 
other assets other assets increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase is primarily due to software upgrades for emv chip technology and certain assets acquired with our new prepaid processing businesses 
trade accounts payable trade accounts payable increased to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to the acquisition of e pay in february approximately million is related to the administration of customer collection and vendor remittance activities in the prepaid processing segment

short term borrowings short term borrowings increased to million at december  from million at december   which have a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
the increase is due to i additional funds needed to support holiday transaction levels in the czech republic  which was paid down in january  ii acquisition of short term payables in transact and aim  and iii borrowings used in the continued expansion of india

capital leases total capital lease obligations including current installments decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease is due primarily to an excess of lease payments of million over additional fixed assets lease obligations of million and foreign exchange impact of million 
the new capital leases are generally for a term of three to five years

forward looking statements this document contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the us securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this document are forward looking statements  including statements regarding the following our business plans and financing plans and requirements trends affecting our business plans and financing plans and requirements trends affecting our business the adequacy of capital to meet our capital requirements and expansion plans the assumptions underlying our business plans business strategy government regulatory action technological advances projected costs and revenues although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
forward looking statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipated  intend  estimate and similar expressions 
investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may materially differ from those in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including the following technological and business developments in the local card  electronic and mobile banking and mobile phone markets affecting transaction and other fees that we are able to charge for our services foreign exchange fluctuations competition from bank owned atm networks  outsource providers of atm services  providers of prepaid mobile phone services and software providers our relationships with our major customers  sponsor banks in various markets  international card organizations and mobile operators  including the risk of contract terminations with our major clients changes in laws and regulations affecting our business these risks and other risks are described elsewhere in this document  including in exhibit  and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission  which are incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk these risks and other risks are described elsewhere in this document  including in exhibit and other filings with the securities and exchange commission  which are incorporating herein by reference 
operational risk  security our business involves the operation and maintenance of a sophisticated computer network and telecommunications connections with banks  financial institutions  retailers and mobile operators 
this  in turn  requires the maintenance of computer equipment and infrastructure  including telecommunications and electrical systems  and the integration and enhancement of complex software applications 
certain operational risks inherent in this type of business can require a temporary shut down of parts or all of our processing systems  including failure of electrical supply  failure of computer hardware and software errors 
all of our atms other than our atms in germany are operated through our processing centers in budapest and mumbai and our e top up transactions are processed through our basildon  munich and us operations centers so any operational problem may have a significant adverse impact on the operation of our network generally 
we have experienced operations and computer development staff and have created redundancies and procedures  particularly in our budapest and basildon processing centers and soon in speyer  germany  to mitigate such risks  but they cannot be eliminated entirely 
any technical failure that prevents operation of our systems for a significant period of time will prevent us from processing transactions during that period of time and will directly and adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
our atm and pos network systems process electronic financial transactions using information read by atms or pos terminals from bank debit and credit cards or input into our systems by our customers in the registration process for or top up of mobile phone prepaid services 
we capture  transmit  handle and store sensitive bankcard information in performing services for our customers 
in addition  our software is designed to permit the operation by our customers of electronic financial transaction networks similar to our network  so our software is used in handling such information 
these businesses involve certain inherent security risks and in particular the risk of electronic interception and theft of the information for use in fraudulent card transactions 
we have incorporated industry standard encryption technology and processing methodology into our systems and software to maintain high levels of security 
although this technology and methodology mitigates security risks  they cannot be eliminated entirely as criminal elements apply increasingly sophisticated technology to attempt to obtain unauthorized access to the information handled by atm and electronic financial transaction networks 
any breach in our security systems could result in the perpetration of fraudulent financial transactions for which we may be found liable 
we are insured against various risks  including theft and negligence  but such insurance is subject to deductibles  exclusions and limitations that may leave us bearing some or all of any losses arising from security breaches 
in addition to electronic fraud issues  theft and vandalism of atms presents risks for our atm business 
we install atms at sites that are high foot traffic sites and are exposed to theft and vandalism 
vandalism during the year increased in some of our markets  particularly in hungary where a series of incidents were attributed to an organized gang that we believe has been apprehended 
although we are insured against such risks  deductibles  exclusions or limitations in such insurance may leave us bearing some or all of any losses arising from theft or vandalism of atms 
in addition  we have experienced increases in claims under our insurance  which has increased our insurance premiums 
foreign exchange exposure in  of our total revenues were generated in poland  hungary  the uk  australia and germany as compared to in and in this increase is due to the acquisition of e pay with operations in the uk and australia  among other countries  and the overall increase in revenues for our operations  including in these five countries 
in hungary and poland  the majority of revenues received are denominated in the hungarian forint and polish zloty  respectively 
however  the majority of our foreign currency denominated contracts in both countries are linked to either inflation or the retail price index 
in the uk  australia and germany  of the revenues received are denominated in the british pound  australian dollar and the euro  respectively 
although a significant portion of our expenditures in these countries are still made in or denominated in local currencies  we are striving to achieve more of our expenses in local currencies to match our revenues 
we estimate that depreciation in foreign exchange rates of the euro  hungarian forint  polish zloty and the british pound sterling and australian dollar against the us dollar would have the combined effect of a million increase in the reported net income 
this effect was estimated by segregating revenues and expenses by the us dollar  hungarian forint  polish zloty  british pound  australian dollar  and euro and then applying currency devaluation to the non us dollar amounts 
we estimate that appreciation in foreign exchange rates of the euro  hungarian forint  polish zloty  the british pound and australian dollar against the us dollar would have the combined effect of a million decrease in the reported net income 
this effect was estimated by segregating revenues and expenses by the us dollar  hungarian forint  polish zloty  british pound  australian dollar and euro and then applying currency appreciation to the non us dollar amounts 
we believe this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing or operating strategies 
as a result of continued european economic convergence  including the increased influence of the euro as opposed to the us dollar on the central european currencies  we expect that the currencies of the markets where we invest will fluctuate less against the euro and the gbp than against the dollar 
accordingly  we believe that our euro and the gbp denominated debt provides  in the medium to long term  for a closer matching of assets and liabilities than would dollar denominated debt 
inflation and functional currencies generally  the countries we operate in have experienced low and stable inflation in recent years 
therefore  the local currency in each of these markets is the functional currency 
although croatia has maintained relatively stable inflation and exchange rates  the functional currency of our croatian subsidiary is the us dollar due to the significant level of us dollar denominated revenues and expenses 
due to these factors  we do not believe that inflation will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we continually review inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries where we operate 
interest rate risk the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our notes payable at december  was approximately million compared to a carrying value of million 
a increase from prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of notes payable by approximately million 
fair values were determined based on the current early redemption premium of approximately of face value as defined in the note agreement and as evidenced by the recent redemption in july see note financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements 
interest payments beginning january   interest payments of approximately million estimated million as of december  became payable semi annually on our outstanding senior debt 
payment dates will be january and july  with the final interest payment due on july  the first three payments due were made when due 
because the bond interest is payable in euro  foreign currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro may result in gains or losses which  in turn  may increase or decrease the amount of us dollar equivalent interest paid 
we currently anticipate making these interest payments from earnings denominated in local currencies in our european markets 
as a result  it may not be necessary to hedge these expected cash payments in us dollars  since the source of funds used for payments would already be in euro or euro linked denominations 
we will actively monitor our potential need to hedge future bond interest payments  and if required  we will initiate hedging strategies to minimize foreign currency losses resulting from payments made from us dollars 
new debt incurred in february  we acquired e pay and incurred indebtedness comprised of three separate elements totaling approximately million 
in january we acquired precept and incurred indebtedness of million 
the terms of this new indebtedness are more fully described in note acquisitions and note subsequent events 
all but million of the e pay indebtedness was repaid or converted to shares of our common stock prior to december  we currently expect to repay all amounts due from available cash flows or  if necessary  will seek to refinance of the debt 
our czech subsidiary entered into an overdraft facility with the a bank for up to approximately million in order to support additional atm network cash needs during the fourth quarter holiday season 
in the fourth quarter we drew the full amount of the facility 
as of january  the facility has been repaid in full 
in february we entered into a two year unsecured revolving credit agreement providing a facility of up to million with a bank 
the proceeds from the facility can be used for working capital needs  acquisitions  and other corporate purposes 
there are certain financial performance covenants that must be maintained under the agreement 
interest accrues on any balances outstanding at a prime based floating rate or libor based rates for day periods 
as of march  no amounts had been drawn under this agreement
