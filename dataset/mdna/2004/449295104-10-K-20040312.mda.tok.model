table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition our management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview the following management discussion and analysis is intended to provide information which will enhance a reader s understanding of our business  results of operations  financial condition and related matters 
it is organized as follows in the section entitled icos corporation background  we briefly describe the importance of collaborations to our business  the business environment in which we operate  our approved product cialis and our clinical and discovery research and development projects and programs 
in results of operations  we discuss each of our most critical accounting policies as well as the primary factors that are likely to contribute to significant variability of our results of operations from period to period 
we then provide detailed narrative regarding significant changes in our and lilly icos results of operations for compared to  and compared to at financial guidance  we provide our expectations regarding icos and lilly icos results of operations for the year ending december  under the section entitled liquidity and capital resources  we discuss our year end liquidity  our cash flows for the year ended december   compared to those for the year ended december   factors that may influence our future cash requirements and the status of certain contractual obligations as of december  finally  under legal proceedings  we discuss the status of certain litigation relating to cialis 
icos corporation background icos corporation is a biotechnology company that is dedicated to bringing innovative therapeutic products to patients 
we are marketing our first product  cialis tadalafil  for the treatment of erectile dysfunction  through lilly icos 
our goal is to develop and commercialize treatments for serious unmet medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  cancer and inflammatory diseases 
over the years  we have established collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to enhance our internal development capabilities  to acquire rights to additional product candidates  and to offset a substantial portion of the financial risk of developing individual product candidates 
in each case  we acquired or retained substantial rights to the product candidates covered by the collaborations 
these rights are intended to provide us with the opportunity to participate in a significant portion of the economic benefit from successful development and commercialization 
our most significant ongoing collaboration is lilly icos 
we expect to establish additional collaborations with pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies in the future 
we operate in a highly regulated business environment 
cialis and our product candidates require extensive regulatory review  approval and oversight prior to commercialization 
for example  the fda regulates  among other things  the development  manufacture  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
our products marketed abroad are also subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
the regulatory processes are lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
they may take years to complete  may involve ongoing requirements for post marketing studies and can affect the nature  content  timing and cost of our marketing efforts 

table of contents the markets in which we compete are well established and intensely competitive 
cialis and our product candidates  if approved and commercialized  compete or are likely to compete against well established existing therapeutic products or treatments 
in addition  a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are currently developing products targeting the same diseases and medical conditions that we target 
key factors affecting our markets include the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  safety and efficacy of therapeutic products  cost and availability of these products  availability of alternative treatments  and protection of patent and proprietary rights 
although  we believe that we are positioned to compete adequately with respect to these factors in the future  our future success is currently difficult to predict 
cialis was only recently approved 
our product candidates are in various stages of research and development and  accordingly  subject to substantial research  development  regulatory approval and commercialization risks 
since timing of market entry can be an important factor in determining a new product s eventual success and profitability  the speed with which we can develop products and receive regulatory approval will likely be important to our commercial success 
cialis tadalafil our first commercial product  cialis  is being prescribed around the world for patients with erectile dysfunction 
cialis is being manufactured and marketed by lilly icos  which has rights to commercialize cialis in north america and europe 
lilly has exclusive rights to market cialis in the remainder of the world  and pays royalties to lilly icos  equal to of net sales  in those territories 
during the first quarter of  lilly icos launched cialis in europe  followed by additional launches later in the year in north america 
cialis became available for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in mexico  in august  and canada  in november lilly icos received fda approval  to market cialis in the united states  on november  the product was available in pharmacies throughout the united states by early december lilly icos also has ongoing programs to evaluate tadalafil as a potential treatment for other medical conditions 
ic ic is an orally administered  small molecule pde inhibitor that is currently in clinical development 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a phase clinical study with ic for the potential treatment of copd 
we expect to complete this study in discovery and preclinical research we are continuously evaluating possible new product candidates in our discovery and preclinical research programs 
the following table summarizes those programs 
program target indication status cell cycle checkpoint dna repair inhibitors cancer preclinical lipid and protein kinase inhibitors inflammatory diseases preclinical other phosphodiesterase inhibitors multiple diseases preclinical cell adhesion molecule antagonists including lfa cardiovascular  autoimmune  inflammatory and fibrotic diseases preclinical chemokine receptor antagonists allergic inflammatory diseases research novel antibiotics infectious diseases research in the status column of the foregoing table preclinical indicates evaluation of lead or preferred compounds for safety  pharmacology and proof of efficacy in non human animal models  and research 
table of contents indicates the research phase of the product identification process for compounds for which activity in target human biological assay systems has been demonstrated in laboratory tests  but which have not yet been tested in non human animal models of specific human diseases 
discontinued product candidates by year end  we completed patient follow up in a phase clinical study evaluating rtx for the treatment of interstitial cystitis 
in late january  it was determined that rtx was not effective in relieving patients symptoms 
we will not pursue additional studies of interstitial cystitis 
ic  a monoclonal antibody  was evaluated as a treatment for sepsis resulting from community acquired pneumonia 
in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that the results of a phase clinical study did not meet our criteria to continue further investment 
in  we concluded our lfa antagonist collaboration with biogen  and reacquired sole development rights to the program 
ic  an lfa antagonist within the collaboration  concluded a small  exploratory phase a clinical study in patients with psoriasis earlier in based on the results of the study  the efficacy observed was insufficient to warrant further development of ic in january  we announced that joint development of endothelin receptor antagonists  through icos tbc  would not continue 
encysive agreed to be responsible for all costs and expenses of icos tbc incurred subsequent to december  on april   encysive acquired all of our interests in icos tbc for million 
in december  the pafase development program was terminated after an interim analysis did not demonstrate clinical benefit in a phase study for severe sepsis 
results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for our share of the operating results of our unconsolidated affiliates  and estimating expenses from contracted research and clinical study activities conducted by various third parties 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from our contracts for research  development  marketing and sales services  including those under collaborative agreements  as the related costs are incurred 
we refer to this revenue as cost reimbursement revenue 
payments received  that are related to future performance  are deferred and recognized as revenue when the future performance occurs 
nonrefundable upfront technology license fees  for product candidates where we are providing continuing services related to product development  are deferred  and recognized as revenue as we provide the services required under the agreement 
we recognize revenue for nonrefundable upfront technology fees based on the ratio of current development costs to total estimated current and future development costs through the date we file an nda or an equivalent with the fda 
we believe this method appropriately matches revenue with the estimated costs of the development effort 
we also believe that development costs are the best available surrogate for benefits obtained as data is collected and other research and development activities progress in the collaboration 
we estimate the total projected development costs based on the specific terms of each agreement  our judgment and experience and  when appropriate  the expertise of our collaboration partners 
the ability to estimate total development effort and costs can vary significantly for each product candidate due to the inherent 
table of contents complexities and uncertainties of drug development 
in the past  we have been able to estimate total expected development costs  for certain product candidates  because they were in later stages of clinical development at the time such estimates were prepared or our partner had substantial previous experience in the relevant field of study 
however  we may not be able to reasonably estimate total expected development costs for product candidates in the future  particularly if such product candidates are in earlier stages of clinical development 
to the extent we cannot estimate the costs to complete development  but can estimate an expected nda filing date  we will recognize license fee revenue ratably through the nda filing date 
if we are unable to reasonably estimate either total costs to complete development or an expected nda filing date performance period  we will defer revenue recognition until one of those estimates can be made or the project is discontinued 
milestones  in the form of additional license fees  typically represent nonrefundable payments to be received in conjunction with the achievement of a specific event identified in the contract  such as initiation or completion of specified clinical development activities 
we believe that a milestone represents the culmination of a distinct earnings process when it is not associated with ongoing research  development or other performance on our part 
we recognize such milestones as revenue when they become due and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when a milestone does not represent the culmination of a distinct earnings process  we recognize revenue at the time such payments are due  provided collectibility is reasonably assured  based on the ratio of effort to date in terms of costs or time  as discussed above to total estimated development effort 
any remaining balance is deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated remaining product development period  in the same manner as our upfront technology license fees 
the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize from licenses of technology  either from upfront fees or milestones where we are providing continuing services related to product development  is dependent upon our estimates of total product development effort as well as the timing of such effort over the estimated development period 
as product candidates move through the development process  it is necessary to revise these estimates to consider changes to the product development cycle  such as changes in the clinical development plan  regulatory requirements  or various other factors  many of which may be outside of our control 
the impact on revenue of changes in our estimates and the timing thereof  is recognized prospectively  over the remaining estimated product development period 
prior to  milestones were recognized as revenue upon attainment of a specified event and nonrefundable technology license fees were recognized as revenue when received  provided any required work had been performed  and we had no continuing performance obligations with respect to that work 
in  we adopted the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 as amended  revenue recognition in financial statements 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of the million deferred in as a result of this change in accounting 
substantially all of this deferred revenue had been recognized by december  contract manufacturing revenue  including fees earned for process development and manufacturing services performed for third parties  is recognized when the manufacturing obligation is fulfilled or manufacturing services are performed  as appropriate  based on the terms of the agreement  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
payments received in excess of amounts earned are recorded as deferred revenue 
accounting for our share of the operating results of our unconsolidated affiliates we recognize our share of the operating results of our unconsolidated affiliates  in proportion to our ownership interest in the affiliate  and report it as equity in losses of affiliates 
losses relating to our affiliates are recognized only to the extent we have made  or are committed to make  capital contributions to the affiliate 
operating results of our affiliates include expenses related to research  development  marketing and sales services that we provide to them  and that we recognize as cost reimbursement revenue 
the amount of our cost reimbursement revenue  and the associated costs  both depend on the continued progression of clinical study research and development activities  the extent and timing of marketing and sales activities  and our level of 
table of contents participation in those activities 
a shift of research  development and co promotional activities among collaboration partners could have a significant impact on our overall operating results to the extent that our negotiated reimbursement rates include indirect and overhead costs that may not vary based on our collaboration activities 
also  a shift of such activities could have a material impact on our costs and expenses and the consequent amount of our cost reimbursement revenue 
for example  the shift of development activities from icos to our affiliate partner would be expected to result in our reporting lower revenue and lower operating expenses  though not necessarily of equal amounts 
estimating expenses from third party contract research and clinical study activities some of our research and development  including certain clinical study activities  is conducted by various third parties  including contract research organizations  which may also provide contractually defined administration and management services 
we recognize expenses for these contracted activities based on a variety of factors  including actual and estimated labor hours  clinical site initiation activities  patient enrollment rates  estimates of external costs  and other activity based factors 
on a regular basis  our estimates of these costs are reconciled to actual invoices from the service providers  and adjustments are made accordingly 
management estimates and assumptions the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
modifications to these assumptions could result in estimates that are substantially different from those reflected in our financial statements 
general our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period 
operating results will depend on  among other factors  the timing  cost and success of new product launches  the timing of expenses  continued funding by collaboration partners  and the timing and progression of research  development  marketing and sales activities 
we may experience significant fluctuations in cost reimbursement revenue  revenue from licenses of technology and contract manufacturing revenue 
cost reimbursement revenue will vary depending upon the extent and timing of research and development collaboration activities  the timing and amount of marketing and sales activities  and our level of participation in those activities 
revenue from licenses of technology will vary as a result of i the nature and extent of product collaboration and other licensing transactions  ii the timing of milestone payments  and iii changes in estimated development costs and or expected completion dates  which depend on the success of clinical studies and other research and development efforts 
contract manufacturing revenue may fluctuate depending upon our needs to manufacture our own internal product candidates  our ability to attract third parties to utilize any remaining manufacturing capacity and the particular terms of the manufacturing agreements 
significant changes in joint venture collaboration activities  which are subject to the oversight of both parties  could cause the amount of affiliate losses to fluctuate from period to period 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue total revenue was million in  compared to million in cost reimbursement revenue was million in  compared to million in the decrease reflects the december termination of pafase development activities and our decision  in early  to conclude our participation in the endothelin receptor antagonist collaboration with encysive 
the decrease was partially offset by higher cost reimbursement revenue from lilly icos  primarily due to reimbursement of the 
table of contents cost of our sales force to promote cialis in the united states 
beginning in september  and continuing through december  our costs of marketing and selling cialis in the united states are fully reimbursable by lilly icos 
thereafter  any costs we incur selling cialis are generally reimbursable by lilly icos at of actual cost 
any marketing costs we incur related to cialis will continue to be fully reimbursed by lilly icos 
revenue from licenses of technology was million in  compared to million in technology license fee revenue included million of previously deferred upfront fees and forgiven loans  received from biogen  which we recognized as revenue in conjunction with our reacquisition of sole development rights to the lfa antagonist program in june revenue from licenses of technology for also included million earned upon the first commercial sale of cialis in the united states 
contract manufacturing revenue was million in  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase primarily reflects greater utilization of contract manufacturing capacity for third party contracts in  including additional development services provided under the associated agreements 
revenue associated with our contract manufacturing services fluctuates significantly based on our internal manufacturing needs and our ability to sell excess capacity to third parties 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million in  compared to million in research and development 
research and development expenses are principally comprised of costs for personnel  including salaries and benefits  occupancy  clinical studies performed by third parties  materials and supplies to support our programs  contract research  manufacturing  consulting arrangements  in licensing fees  and other expenses incurred to sustain our overall research and development program 
research and development expenses decreased million  to million in this decrease was primarily due to discontinuation of activities associated with the pafase and endothelin receptor antagonist programs  partially offset by increased costs related to development activities associated with cialis and rtx 
our research and development activities occur in two main areas i discovery and preclinical research  and  ii clinical research and development  including the formulation and manufacture of drug substance for use in clinical studies and  when appropriate  seeking approval for commercial manufacturing and marketing 
our discovery and preclinical research focuses on the identification and initial testing of new product candidates 
during this stage  we identify new drug targets and lead compounds  and then optimize their characteristics through repetitive cycles of chemical modification 
compounds that demonstrate the most attractive characteristics and that appear to offer the potential for therapeutic benefit are subsequently evaluated in laboratory preclinical studies to evaluate their safety  pharmacology and efficacy in animal models 
based on the results of preclinical studies  specific compounds may be selected to advance to clinical research and development 
clinical research and development refers to internal and external activities associated with clinical studies in humans and advancing clinical product candidates towards a goal of seeking regulatory marketing approval 
such activities include  among other things  services provided by clinical research organizations and principal investigators and concurrent activities associated with advancing a clinical product candidate  such as the manufacture and formulation of drug compounds for clinical studies and in preparation for commercial scale production 
the clinical development process involves several rigorous stages  many of which are strictly prescribed and monitored by regulatory authorities  such as the fda 
our clinical research and development expenses include the costs of activities that are not attributable to individual projects  but are necessary to support our overall clinical program 
these indirect costs are primarily associated with general regulatory compliance  staff training  development and maintenance of clinical processes and information systems  executive management and administrative support 
these indirect costs are not allocated to development projects 

table of contents the following table provides information regarding our research and development expenses  by project year ended december  in thousands approved product cialis ongoing clinical project ic discontinued clinical projects rtx ic ic endothelin receptor antagonists pafase indirect clinical costs discovery and preclinical research total research and development expenses through december   cumulative research and development expenditures for ic were million 
development of a new drug product is a lengthy and expensive process  involving a high degree of uncertainty 
very few research and development projects result in a commercial product 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any of our potential products  we must subject them to extensive preclinical and clinical testing to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in humans 
at any time during the multi year clinical development period  factors such as ineffectiveness of the product candidate  discovery of unacceptable toxicities or side effects  development of disease resistance or other physiological factors  or delays in patient enrollment or other development activities could cause us to interrupt  limit  delay or abort the development of a product candidate 
because of the uncertainties of clinical research and development  at this time we are unable to provide estimates of project completion dates  the timing of our research and development efforts and the costs of completing research and development for ic various statutes and regulations govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  marketing and other factors that are critical in the development and commercialization of a product candidate 
the lengthy process of complying with the applicable statutes and regulations and seeking necessary regulatory approvals requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a substantial delay in completing clinical studies or obtaining regulatory approvals could severely harm our business 
such delays could require that we spend substantial additional funds to continue our development efforts  delay  for a considerable period of time  our ability to seek or obtain regulatory approvals needed to market our potential products  and  provide existing or new competitive products with the opportunity to expand their share or enter the market before ours 
these  and similar events  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to bring a product to market  substantially increasing the cost of development and postponing  reducing or eliminating the potential to generate net cash inflows from the successful commercialization of a product 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expenses principally consist of costs associated with our pharmaceutical sales force  marketing activities for cialis and market research activities for our product candidates in research and development 
marketing and selling expenses increased million  to million in this increase reflects incremental costs associated with recruiting  hiring  training  and deploying our us sales force to promote cialis  primarily to urologists 

table of contents cost of contract manufacturing 
contract manufacturing expenses are principally comprised of costs for personnel  including salaries and benefits  occupancy  raw materials and consumables used in process development and manufacturing  testing services provided by third parties  facility overhead  including taxes  depreciation  utilities and maintenance of manufacturing equipment  and other shared services  including information systems and staff support 
contract manufacturing expenses increased million  to million in the increase primarily reflects incremental costs associated with greater utilization of manufacturing capacity for third party contracts and additional development services provided under the associated agreements

financial guidance for  we expect that icos corporation s net loss will be in the range of million per share to million per share 
the increase in expected loss  compared to  is due to two primary reasons an expected increase in our share of the losses of lilly icos 
lilly icos net loss is expected to be in the million to million range  as the us cialis launch proceeds and associated direct to consumer and other marketing and sales programs become fully operational 
the level of cialis sales achieved in the us is the primary variable that will affect lilly icos results for  and the impact of certain items in which  in the aggregate  reduced our net loss by approximately million 
those items were million of technology license fee revenue associated with the conclusion of our lfa collaboration with biogen  million of license fee revenue earned upon the first commercial sale of cialis in the us  and  a million gain upon the sale of our partnership interests in icos tbc  partially offset by approximately million in start up expenses to recruit  hire  train and deploy our sales force

the series a warrants were issued in  and  if unexercised  expired on may  financing cash inflows during and also included million and million  respectively  in borrowings under our line of credit with biogen  all of which have been forgiven 
our existing cash and cash equivalents  investment securities  interest income from our investments  cash flow from other operating activities  including anticipated payments from lilly icos and cash flow from potential future collaborations  may be sufficient to fund our future operations 
however  in view of the very early stage of the commercial launch of cialis in north america  our ongoing research and development efforts  and potential expansion of our operations through in licensing or other means  it is possible that we may need to seek additional financing sometime over the next few years 
additional financing may not be available when we need it or may be unavailable on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures  for some of our marketing and selling activities or our development programs  or grant rights to third parties to develop and market product candidates that we would prefer to develop and market on our own 
our future cash requirements will depend on various factors which  to some extent  are beyond our control  including the successful commercialization of cialis throughout the world  including territories where lilly has exclusive marketing rights  funding levels for research and development programs  including continued funding from our collaboration partners  the results  timing and extent of preclinical and clinical studies  the time and costs involved in filing and prosecuting patents and enforcing and defending patent claims  the regulatory process in the us and other countries  acquisitions of products or technologies  if any  relationships with research and development collaborators  capital contributions to our affiliates  competing technological and market development activities  and the time and costs of manufacturing  scale up and commercialization activities 

table of contents we have engaged in collaborations and joint development agreements with other parties where the capabilities and strategies of the other parties complement ours 
although corporate collaborations  partnerships and joint ventures have provided cost reimbursement revenue to us in the past  we cannot assure you that this type of revenue will be available to us in the future 
the vast majority of our cost reimbursement revenue  through august  was for reimbursement of the cost of research and development services that we provided 
beginning in september  collaboration revenue includes reimbursement for the cost of sales services that we provide to lilly icos related to commercialization of cialis in the united states 
we intend to expand our operations and continue development of our current portfolio of product candidates in clinical studies  as well as to continue discovery and preclinical research to identify additional product candidates 
we also intend to continue to engage in pre marketing activities necessary to bring our product candidates to market and to expand marketing and selling capabilities for our approved products 
due to the uncertainties of drug development and commercialization  as discussed elsewhere herein  we are unable to determine if  or when  any of our current product candidates will begin to generate net cash inflows 
in the future  we may pursue new growth opportunities in a variety of ways including  but not limited to  internal discovery and development of new products  in licensing of products and technologies and or merger or acquisition of companies with desirable products and or technologies 
expansion of our operations  including the us launch of cialis  will increase our future operating expenses 
furthermore  we may need to make incremental expenditures for additional laboratory  production and office facilities to accommodate the activities and personnel associated with these increased development and commercialization efforts 
any of these activities may require substantial capital investment 
our operating cash flows include the effect of certain noncancelable  contractual obligations 
a summary of our contractual obligations  as of december   is as follows payments due by period in thousands total less than year to years to years more than years convertible subordinated debt operating leases convertible subordinated debt in  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes  which accrue interest at per annum  payable semiannually each january and july the notes mature on july  the notes are unsecured  subordinated to any senior indebtedness  and convertible  at the option of the holder  into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
note holders may require us to purchase  for cash  all or a portion of their notes on july   or at a price equal to the principal amount of the notes being repurchased 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes  at par  for cash at any time on or after july  operating leases we lease certain property and equipment under operating leases which  in the aggregate  obligate us through many of our leases contain renewal options and provide for escalations of rent and payment of real estate taxes  maintenance  insurance and certain other operating expenses of the properties 
in addition to the contractual obligations noted above  we have entered into various licensing and research and development arrangements under which we may be obligated to make future payments to third parties upon the achievement of certain success based objectives 
we also have entered into contracts with various third parties  under which we may be required to pay immaterial amounts in the event of contract termination 
in connection with our acquisition of technology rights to certain pde inhibitors  including cialis tadalafil  we committed to pay a third party a royalty equal to of the net sales of products developed utilizing the acquired technology 
lilly icos and lilly have accepted primary responsibility for any royalty obligations resulting from this arrangement 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements that contingently require us to indemnify counterparties against third party claims 
these may include agreements with vendors and suppliers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services  agreements with customers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use of our products or services  real estate and equipment leases  under which we may indemnify lessors against third party claims relating to use of their property  agreements with licensees or licensors  under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property  and agreements with initial purchasers and underwriters of our securities  under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions 
the nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract  and generally a maximum obligation is not stated 
because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation  and because management does not expect these indemnifications to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  no related liabilities are recorded at december  we hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain indemnifications and  historically  we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these obligations 
legal proceedings in october  pfizer inc  pfizer limited  and pfizer ireland pharmaceuticals filed a patent infringement lawsuit against icos  lilly icos  and lilly in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
the complaint alleges that the intended and imminent use  offering for sale  selling  manufacture  or importing into the united states upon fda approval of cialis for the treatment of erectile dysfunction by icos  lilly icos and lilly will constitute infringement of plaintiffs us patent no 
 the plaintiffs seek a judgment declaring that the defendants using  selling  offering for sale  making or importing of cialis for the treatment of erectile dysfunction will infringe this patent 
the plaintiffs also seek a permanent injunction  attorneys fees  costs and expenses 
in january  we filed an answer denying the central allegations of plaintiffs complaint and setting forth various affirmative defenses 
in september  the pto ordered the reexamination of us patent no 
 the reexamination process is provided for by law and requires the pto to consider the validity of the patent based on substantial new questions of patentability raised by the pto 
in october  icos  lilly icos and lilly filed a motion for a stay with the district court  to suspend the patent infringement lawsuit  pending the outcome of the reexamination 
in november  the judge granted the requested stay 
in december  lilly icos filed its own reexamination request  related to us patent no 
 with the pto 
pfizer s corresponding european method of use patent was previously held invalid in the first stage of an opposition proceeding in the european patent office 
pfizer is now appealing that decision to the technical board of appeal of the european patent office 
a hearing is expected in the second half of the united kingdom court of appeal has previously held the united kingdom counterpart to this patent invalid 
litigation relating to the corresponding patent is pending in canada and mexico 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and the eventual outcome in a particular case is impossible to determine in advance 
we believe that pfizer s suit lacks merit and intend to vigorously pursue our various defenses 
if pfizer were to prevail in one or more countries  however  we might be subject to substantial damages  prohibited from marketing cialis for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in those countries  or required to enter into a licensing agreement to market cialis in those countries 
any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  and  our financial instruments include  among other items  cash  cash equivalents  marketable investment securities  a note receivable and convertible subordinated debt  which bears interest at a fixed interest rate of per annum 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our 
table of contents exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our marketable investment securities  note receivable and convertible subordinated debt 
because of the relatively short maturities of our investments and note receivable  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to materially affect the aggregate value of our financial assets 
the fair value of our convertible subordinated debt is expected to change  to a small extent  inversely to changes in interest rates 
more importantly  however  the fair value of our convertible subordinated debt is expected to change as our stock price changes 
the fair value of our convertible subordinated debt was million at december   with a carrying amount of million at that date
