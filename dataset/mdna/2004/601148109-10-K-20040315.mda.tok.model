the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report and the critical accounting policies outlined at the end of this section 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in risk factors contained elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a fully integrated  self managed real estate investment trust reit which engages in the ownership  development  redevelopment  leasing  acquisition  expansion and management of a portfolio of retail and entertainment oriented centers comprised of mills landmark centers  ten st century retail and entertainment centers and one international retail and entertainment center 
through a subsidiary  we provide development  management  leasing and financial services to entities owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures 
executive summary we are engaged in the development  acquisition and operation of retail and entertainment real estate 
our primary source of revenue is tenant leases and so it is both the opportunity and challenge of our business to provide an environment where consumers are drawn to our properties providing tenants the opportunity to achieve success through high sales volumes 
properly defining the market area and its demographics  along with evaluating trends in where and how people shop  are key elements in identifying sites which can be successfully developed 
the results of our operating properties are impacted by the supply and demand for retail space  the strength or weakness of consumer demand and the financial health of retail tenants 
management reviews the funds from operations ffo of each property 
additional key measures we use to evaluate the performance of our operating properties are tenant sales volumes and sales per square foot  average rents  re leasing spreads and occupancy rates 
ffo is a supplemental measure of operating performance used by management 
it is also a metric widely used in our industry 
ffo is a non gaap measure and should be considered by investors to be a supplemental measure to gaap performance measures such as revenues  net income and earnings per share 
interest rates are a critical factor in all facets of our business 
consistent with the real estate industry  we finance our projects with considerable debt so fluctuations in interest rates could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using long term fixed rate or hedged to maturity debt on our stabilized properties and by hedging a significant portion of our floating rate debt 
in acquiring a property we evaluate the property s historical tenant sales levels  average rents and re leasing spreads 
we also consider our ability to add value to the property by enhancing the tenant mix  adding dining and entertainment options and or expansion and redevelopment opportunities 
our ability to finance the investment with debt and or to bring in a joint venture partner is also considered 
in  we articulated a three prong strategy of expanding beyond our mills landmark centers to also focus on st century retail and entertainment centers and international retail and entertainment centers 
during  our historical development pipeline produced st 
louis mills  but we also acquired nine properties for a total purchase price of billion and opened our first international project near madrid  spain 
we anticipate additional projects in foreign countries 
for foreign investments  we evaluate additional factors such as the ability to partner with local developers and financiers  the stability of the local economy  costs associated with foreign taxes  currency hedging strategies  statutory requirements  and local customs 
operating portfolio data as noted above  we evaluate a number of factors for our operating properties 
for our operating portfolio  which includes our unconsolidated joint ventures  all such factors were positive when compared to occupancy at comparable properties rose basis points to comparable same center tenant sales per square foot rose to average rent per square foot rose to  and re leasing spreads  excluding properties in the initial lease up period  increased to for our anchor stores and to for our in line retailers comparisons are made for properties that we have owned and or have been open for at least two years 
re leasing spreads also exclude properties that are in an initial lease up phase since there are no comparative prior rents 
the improvements in all of the key operating metrics reflect the strength of consumer spending despite the overall lackluster performance of the us economy in and the results of our remerchandising efforts 
tenant sales per square foot in excess of are generally viewed in our industry as an indication of a well performing retail project 
the re leasing spreads for anchor tenants illustrate that when leases terminate we are able to re lease the space to successful retailers at higher rents but even more importantly to tenants that may do much higher sales volumes thereby attracting more consumers to our projects and benefiting all of the retailers at the project 
results of operations in evaluating our results of operations on a consolidated basis from year to year  it is important to isolate the impact of properties opened  acquired or sold during either period 
since for our consolidated portfolio  over of the increase in each property related line item is related to the growth in the portfolio  our discussion will focus on the portion of the increase or decrease related to our properties that we have owned and or that have been open for at least two years comparable operations 
the acquisitions and developments are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources portion of this discussion 
the line items shown in the following tables are the items we think are important in understanding our operations and which had significant changes from year to year

partially offsetting these increases was an increase in capitalized interest

other income expense other income expense increased million or due primarily to higher tax incremental financing income at one center and higher land sale gains 
our equity in earnings our equity in earnings increased million or from to the increase is primarily attributable to the changes described above as well as the impact of increasing our interests in five joint venture properties in funds from operations ffo ffo is a widely recognized metric in the real estate industry  in particular  reits 
accounting for real estate assets using historical cost accounting under gaap assumes that the value of such assets diminishes predictably over time 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit stated in its april white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result the concept of ffo was created by nareit 
as defined by nareit  ffo is net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
for management analysis purposes  we adjust nareit defined ffo to exclude the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflected in net income arising primarily through the re measurement process of translating foreign investment and advance accounts for inclusion in our us dollar financial statements 
although we believe this adjustment presents ffo on a more comparable basis to ffo presented by other reits  it is important to realize that our ffo computation may be significantly different from that used by other reits and  accordingly  may  in fact  not be comparable 
management uses ffo to measure operating performance of our business and as one of several criteria to determine performance based bonuses 
we offer this measure to assist the users of our financial statements in analyzing our performance  however  this is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered a measure of liquidity  an alternative to net income or an indicator of any other performance measure determined in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on this measure as a substitute for any gaap measure  including net income 
the following  in millions  reconciles net income  which is considered to be the most comparable gaap measure to ffo 
we urge the users of our financial statements  including investors and potential investors in our securities  to carefully review the following reconciliation 
years ended december  net income add depreciation and amortization equity in depreciation and amortization deduct gain on sale of real estate joint venture interests foreign currency exchange gains  net equity in foreign currency exchange losses gains  net minority interest s share of the above adjustments ffo assuming all of the convertible units of mills lp  the operating partnership  were converted to common shares  the minority interest in partnership earnings would not be deducted in calculating ffo 
the following  in millions  reconciles ffo as shown above to mills lp ffo 
years ended december  ffo as shown above add minority interest reflected as equity in mills lp mills lp ffo preferred unit distributions mills lp ffo available to common unit holders units convertible on a one for one basis to common shares at period end liquidity and capital resources our short term liquidity is derived primarily from tenant leases that generate positive net cash flow from operations and distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures 
there are currently no significant restrictions on distributions from our joint ventures 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  distributions from joint ventures were million for the year ended december  we anticipate that the net cash provided by operating activities and distributions from joint ventures will continue to be available to fund annual debt service payments  recurring capital expenditures and distributions to stock and unit holders 
our million line of credit is available to fund our cash needs  primarily our development and capital expenditures 
at december   million was available under our line of credit 
at december   our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million  excluding restricted cash of million which is used to pay operating and capital expenditures of operating properties that serve as collateral for secured loan facilities  and excluding our proportionate share of cash held by unconsolidated joint ventures 
in addition  at december   our consolidated joint ventures had combined cash and cash equivalents totaling million  excluding the joint ventures restricted cash balances of million 
capital transactions during the past three years  we completed a number of capital transactions that improved our balance sheet and overall liquidity 
these transactions included construction loans  debt refinancing  common and preferred stock and unit issuances  and joint venture partner equity 
the impact on our liquidity and balance sheet are highlighted by the following key ratios which are computed including our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture operations and debt years ended december  coverage ratios interest coverage ratio fixed charge ratio leverage ratio debt to market capitalization ratio debt indicators weighted average maturity in years yrs yrs yrs weighted average interest rate fixed rate debt percentage fixed rate debt percentage  including swaps includes swaps in place through december st of the year following the period presented financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  in addition  during our unconsolidated joint ventures completed a number of financing transactions

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in detail in note of the notes to financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
the following briefly describes those accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our business and the preceding discussion and analysis minimum rent from income producing properties is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases and includes amortization of deferred revenue resulting from acquired leases 
percentage rent is recognized when tenants sales have reached certain sales levels as specified in the underlying lease 
recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
in order to maintain our status as a reit  we are required to distribute of our taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests in addition to other requirements 
we monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact our reit status 
if we fail to meet our reit status  then we would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate rates for a period of four additional years before we could reapply for reit status 
the cost of acquired income producing property represents the allocation of purchase price to such assets based on appraisals and other valuation methods used in accounting for the acquisition and includes  if material  an allocation to identifiable intangible assets such as above below market leases and at market leases in place at date of acquisition based on their fair values 
external costs directly related to acquisition opportunities we are actively pursuing are capitalized 
if we are successful in completing the acquisition  such costs are allocated to the acquired property as part of the purchase price 
if not  such costs are expensed in the period it becomes likely the acquisition will not be completed 
income producing properties are individually evaluated for impairment when various conditions exist that may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows from a property are less than its historical net cost basis 
upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred  we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of historical cost basis over fair value 
in addition  we write off costs related to predevelopment projects when we determine that we will no longer pursue the project 
equity in the income or loss of joint ventures is recorded on the equity method of accounting based on an estimate of each partner s economic ownership 
economic ownership is determined based on anticipated stabilized cash flows that would be distributed to each partner 
the functional currency for entities operating or projects in development outside the united states is the currency of the country in which the entity or project is located 
the financial statements of such entities are translated from the functional currency into us dollars for inclusion in our financial statements 
in addition  our foreign investment and related advances are denominated in the foreign entity s functional currency and re measured to our functional currency of the us dollar 
we expect to settle these amounts in the foreseeable future through distributions from the foreign entity 
accordingly  gains or losses resulting from the re measurement are included in the determination of net income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we and our joint ventures are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
to limit this exposure  established risk management policies and procedures including the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risk are followed 
derivative instruments are not used for speculative purposes 
derivative instruments used for hedging must be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure 
changes in the hedging instrument s fair value related to the effective portion of the risk being hedged are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs 
hedges that meet these criteria are formally designated as cash flow hedges at the inception of the derivative contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is marked to market with the change included in net income in each period until the derivative instrument matures 
additionally  any derivative instrument used for risk management that becomes ineffective is marked to market through earnings 
depending on the underlying exposure  interest rate swaps  caps and floors  options  forwards or a combination thereof  may be used to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate swaps and collars are contractual agreements with third parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments periodically without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts notional amounts 
in the unlikely event that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of an interest rate swap contract or collar agreement  the exposure is limited to the interest rate differential on the notional amount 
we do not anticipate non performance by any of its counterparties 
net interest differentials to be paid or received under a swap contract and or collar agreement are accrued as interest expense as incurred or earned 
interest rate hedges designated as cash flow hedges hedge the future cash outflows on debt 
interest rate swaps that convert variable payments to fixed payments  interest rate caps  floors  collars and forwards are cash flow hedges 
the unrealized gains losses in the fair value of these hedges are reported on the balance sheet and included in accounts payable and other liabilities or in investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for joint venture hedges with a corresponding adjustment to either accumulated other comprehensive income loss or earnings depending on the hedging relationship 
if the hedging transaction is a cash flow hedge  then the offsetting gains losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent of the effective portion of the risk being hedged 
changes in the hedging instrument s fair value related to the effective portion of the risk being hedged are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
changes in fair value representing the ineffectiveness of the hedging relationship and any other component of fair value not related to the risk being hedged are recorded as interest expense through earnings 
some derivative instruments are associated with the hedge of an anticipated transaction 
over time  the unrealized gains losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be recognized in earnings consistent with when the hedged items are recognized in earnings 
the following summarizes the interest rate swaps we and our joint ventures have currently entered into to hedge the variability of monthly cash outflows due to the variability in libor 
the swaps require us to receive libor and pay a fixed rate 
a summary of the current and deferred start swap terms of the derivative instruments  a reconciliation of their fair values and adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows dollars in thousands wholly owned joint venture hedge type cash flow cash flow description swap swap range of notional amounts     range of interest rate range of deferred effective start dates none range of maturity dates accumulated other comprehensive loss at december   change in fair value   accumulated other comprehensive loss at december   the following disclosures of estimated fair value were determined by management  using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we could realize on disposition of the financial instruments 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
disclosure about fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to management at december  and although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the reasonable fair value amounts  such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these consolidated financial statements since december   and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein 
the following table  in millions of dollars  presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates  including the effect of interest rate swaps currently in effect  for our consolidated mortgages  notes and loans payable that may be sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate thereafter total  estimated fair value at december   at december  the company had fixed rate debt aggregating  million with an estimated fair value of  million and variable debt totaling million which approximated its fair value 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign joint venture investments and advance balances that are denominated in the foreign currency of the investment and thus require re measurement into the us dollar 
the exposure to foreign currency exchange risk related to translating the income and expenses of our equity investments is minimal due to the fact that most transactions occur in the functional currency of that entity 
we currently have not hedged the foreign joint venture investments and advance balances 
a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in an approximate impact of million to income before minority interest for the year ended december
