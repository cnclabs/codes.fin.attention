the purchase price consisted of approximately  in cash which included the sale to web of certain of our laundry route equipment and related contracts in western states valued at approximately  this acquisition will add approximately  of annual net revenue  representing approximately of our revenue derived from laundry facility management operations 
concurrent with the web acquisition  we entered into an amended senior secured credit facility with our lenders to increase the facility from  to  consisting of a  three year revolving credit line and a  five year term loan 
in addition to the increased borrowing capacity and providing for the acquisition of web s assets and the sale of certain of our assets to web  this amendment extends the terms of the revolving credit line and term loan to june  and june   respectively

results of operations dollars in thousands fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenue in each of our facility management  rental and sales businesses for the years ended december   and were as follows revenue laundry facilities management    laundry equipment sales    reprographics facilities management    total laundry and reprographics    microfridge equipment sales    microfridge rental    total microfridge    total revenue    revenue decreased by  or less than  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this decrease was related to decreases in microfridge sales and rental revenue and reprographics facilities management revenue  offset by increases in laundry facilities management revenue  and laundry equipment sales 
the  decrease in microfridge revenue  as compared to  is attributable primarily to a decrease of  or  in the academic sales and rental business 
the microfridge academic market decreases were offset  in part  by an increase in revenue of  or  in the microfridge government and military sales business 
revenues for the microfridge hotel and assisted living business was essentially the same in as in the decrease in the academic business  as compared to  was caused primarily by fewer sales of microfridge units to colleges and universities  and less rental business on campuses  both rented to colleges and directly to students 
we believe these lower numbers were due to colleges and universities shifting the cost of purchasing certain amenities to the students as well as the increased availability of similar products at retail stores 
the increased availability of similar appliances at retail stores and our avoidance of low margin rental contracts are the primary reasons for microfridge rental income decreasing in as compared to although it is the company s strategy to convert school rental customers to a purchase program  the company has not been successful in converting sufficient programs to offset losses resulting from this ongoing decline in microfridge rental revenue and does not believe it will be able to achieve this objective in the future 
the increase in microfridge government and military sales is due primarily to the increased government spending on military base housing  and the company s increased sales and marketing efforts toward this business segment 
total laundry facilities management revenue increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared to this increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of machines in service  increases in vend rates  and continued conversion from coin operated equipment to higher revenue generating card operated equipment  partially offset by a decrease in revenue caused by an increase in apartment vacancy rates in all of the company s laundry facilities management markets 
the apartment vacancy rates have increased for the second consecutive year  particularly in florida  georgia  and north carolina  where the company generates approximately of its laundry facilities management revenue 
vacancy rates also continue to increase in the northeastern markets where the company also conducts a significant portion of its business  though not to the extent of the increases in the southern markets 
fourth quarter industry indicators show that growth in the apartment vacancy rate is slowing in nearly all of the company s markets 
the increase in the number of machines placed in service was achieved through increases in all of the company s laundry facilities management service markets  particularly the northeast  where targeted marketing campaigns  and experienced sales personnel were added 
increases in machine vend rates are typically made at locations which have not had an increase in vend price for over a year 
an increase in vend price at a coin operated location will typically be increments of per use  whereas at a card operated location the increase may vary due to technology allowing for increases in more flexible increments 
reprographics facilities management revenue decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared to this decrease was attributable to the decrease in machine use in libraries and similar facilities  as compared to  and a reduction in the number of locations operated by the company 
in  the company continued its strategy  begun in the second half of  of not renewing contracts when it could not negotiate acceptable pricing terms 
this resulted in the elimination of approximately accounts in  representing approximately of reprographics revenue 
also affecting the revenue decline in as compared to were accounts not yet renegotiated or eliminated which had decreased usage as compared to laundry equipment sales increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to this increase was attributable primarily to success at further penetrating the government market 
sales to laundromat owners and other traditional customers were approximately even with results 
facilities rent 
facilities rent  the amount paid to property owners or managers and schools and public libraries  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in laundry facilities management revenue of  partially offset by a decrease in reprographics revenue of the ratio of laundry facilities rent to laundry facilities management revenue did not change for the year ended december  as compared to laundry facilities rent can be affected by new and renegotiated contracts and by other factors such as the amount of prepaid rent payments and laundry room betterments invested in new or renegotiated contracts 
as the company varies the amount invested in a property  the facilities rent as a derivative of facilities management revenue can vary 
prepaid rent payments and betterments are amortized over the life of the contract 
the percentage of facilities rent to revenue is also impacted by the rent rate structure in the reprographics segment 
because this segment has a much lower rent rate structure than the laundry segment  any decrease in revenue will result in an increase in the overall facilities rent percentage of revenue 
facilities expenditures and other direct costs 
facilities expenditures and other direct costs include costs associated with installing and servicing laundry and reprographics facility equipment  as well as the costs of collecting  counting and depositing the revenue 
facilities expenditures also include the costs of delivering and servicing sold and rented laundry and microfridge equipment 
facilities expenditures decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  facilities expenditures were and  respectively  of total revenues for the years ended december  and facilities expenditures can be affected significantly by the mix of revenue 
in  laundry and microfridge equipment sales decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue 
these sales typically create higher operating costs due to delivery and installation generally being more costly in the sales business than in the facilities management business 
the decrease in facilities expenditures and other direct costs was due to the decrease in overall revenue as well as the company s implementation of various cost cutting programs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization include amounts included as a component of cost of revenue  which are primarily related to laundry and microfridge equipment in the field  and amounts included as an operating expense  which are primarily non revenue generating corporate assets 
aggregate depreciation and amortization increased by  or  from the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  depreciation expense of property  plant and equipment increased by when compared to due to increased purchases of equipment in as compared to cost of product sales 
cost of product sales increased by  or  from the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  gross margins on product sales were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the gross margin on product sales includes laundry and microfridge equipment sales 
the gross margin in the laundry equipment sales business remained unchanged in as compared to the gross margin associated with microfridge equipment sales decreased from of revenue in to in this decline was caused primarily by the change in sales mix  specifically  a decrease in higher margin sales to the academic markets 
general  administration  sales and marketing expense 
general  administration  sales and marketing expenses increased by from the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  general  administration  sales and marketing expenses were of revenue for the years ended december  and this increase in spending was primarily attributable to increases in advertising  promotional spending and professional fees 
the increase in advertising was primarily in the microfridge and laundry facilities management businesses  followed by the laundry equipment sales business 
the increase in advertising spending in the laundry facilities business was in connection with growth strategies in some markets 
in the microfridge and laundry equipment sales businesses  increased advertising expenditures were in reaction to the effect of the general economic downturn and competitive factors 
loss on early extinguishment of debt 
on june  the company entered into a new senior secured credit facility to replace an agreement entered into in in connection with the termination of the agreement  of related expenses  which had previously been capitalized and not fully amortized at the time the june  agreement was executed  were written off 
interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased by  or  from the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily related to the decrease in interest rates charged to the company  a decrease in total borrowings  and the impact of the new interest rate swap agreement having a lower fixed rate than those that were terminated 
the total bank borrowings of the company decreased by  during the year from  at december   to  at december  interest expense for the years ended december  and include non cash expense of and respectively  before the effect of income taxes  related to the terminated swap agreements 
gain on sale of lease receivables 
during  the company sold certain lease receivables associated with the microfridge division 
the gain associated with this sale is primarily attributable to the interest income that would have been recognized throughout the life of the lease had it not been sold 
provision for income tax 
the effective tax rate increased from to from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the provision for income tax is higher than the company s statutory tax rate primarily due to deductions recognized for financial reporting purposes  which are not deductible for federal and state tax purposes 
following is the impact on earnings of implementing fas on the years ended december  and  and what the impact on the same period in would have been also see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  per share per share per share reported earnings    add impairment charge in accordance with fas net of taxes add goodwill amortization net of taxes  fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenue decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in microfridge sales and rental revenue and  to a lesser extent  to decreases in laundry facilities management revenue and reprographics facilities management revenue  partially offset by an increase in laundry equipment sales 
the decrease in microfridge revenue  as compared to  is attributable primarily to a decrease of in the academic sales and rental business and a decrease in the hotel and assisted living business 
these microfridge decreases were offset  in part  by a increase in sales of microfridge products to the government market 
the decrease in academic business  as compared to  was caused primarily by less rental business on campus  both rented to colleges and universities and rented directly to students 
we believe these lower numbers were due to hesitation on the part of the schools to commit to such a program in such uncertain economic times  and to students purchasing similar units at retail stores 
we continue to avoid entering into rental contracts  which fail to reach an acceptable profit margin for the company  and we continue our strategy of attempting to convert our school rental customers to a purchase program 
in any given period  the company may be unable to offset losses resulting from this intended ongoing decline in microfridge rental revenue 
we believe sales to the academic  hotel and assisted living markets have decreased  as compared to  primarily due to the overall slower us economy 
many schools have deferred spending due to endowment contributions to operating budgets being lower than in past years 
further  hotels and assisted living facilities have reduced spending due  in part  to the inability to finance expansion and remodeling of units as well as the overall decline in hotel occupancy due to the general us economic slowdown 
total laundry facilities management revenue decreased by  or less than  due primarily to an increase in apartment vacancy rates in all of the company s laundry facilities management markets 
the apartment vacancy rates have increased in those southern states where the company conducts business  particularly florida  georgia  and north carolina where the company believes this increase in vacancy rates has led to a decline in revenue 
vacancy rates have not increased to the same extent in the company s northern markets and the company experienced revenue gains in those markets in the decreases were partially offset by machines added to the total number in service  increases in vend rates  and continued conversion from coin operated equipment to higher revenue generating card operated equipment 
increases in machine vend rates are typically taken at locations which have not had an increase in vend price for over a year 
an increase in vend price at a coin operated location will typically be in increments of per use  whereas at a card operated location the increase may vary due to technology allowing for increases at more flexible increments 
reprographics facilities management revenue in decreased by  or  as compared to this decrease was attributable to the decrease in machine use in libraries and similar facilities  as compared to  and a reduction in the number of locations operated by the company 
in the second half of  the company chose to not renew several contracts when it could not negotiate acceptable terms 
the company also chose to terminate several small at will accounts which were no longer profitable due to declining revenue 
in total  the company eliminated approximately accounts  representing approximately of its revenue 
laundry equipment sales increased in as compared to by  or 
this increase was attributable primarily to success at further penetrating the government market  offset somewhat by a decrease of sales to laundromats and other traditional customers 
facilities rent 
facilities rent  the amount paid to property owners or managers and school and public libraries  decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in laundry facilities management revenue of and reprographics revenue of  and an improvement in the ratio of laundry facilities rent to laundry facilities management revenue 
the improvement of laundry facilities management rent as a percentage of laundry facilities management revenue in is primarily attributable to new and renegotiated laundry facilities management contracts having improved facilities rent formulas 
in addition to laundry facilities rent being affected by new and renegotiated contracts  laundry facilities rent can be affected by other factors such as the amount of prepaid rent payments and laundry room betterments invested in new or renegotiated contracts 
as the company varies the amount invested in a property  the facilities rent as a derivative of facilities management revenue can vary 
prepaid rent payments and betterments are amortized over the life of the contract 
the percentage of facilities rent to revenue is also impacted by the rent rate structure in the reprographics segment 
because this segment has a much lower rent rate structure than the laundry segment  any decrease in revenue will result in an increase in the overall facilities rent percentage of revenue 
reprographics facilities management revenue decreased in as compared to by facilities expenditures and other direct costs 
facilities expenditures and other direct costs include costs associated with installing and servicing laundry and reprographics facilities machines  as well as the costs of collecting  counting and depositing the revenue 
facilities expenditures also include the costs of delivering and servicing sold and rented laundry and microfridge equipment 
facilities expenditures increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  facilities expenditures were and  respectively  of total revenues for the years ended december  and december  despite a decrease in total revenue of  in as compared to  facilities expenditures and other direct costs remained nearly flat due to the fixed nature of many facilities operating expenses  and increases in variable expenses partially offset by cost cutting programs 
facilities expenditures are also affected by the mix of revenue 
in  laundry and microfridge equipment sales increased slightly as a percentage of total revenue 
these sales create higher operating costs due to delivery and installation generally being more costly in the sales business than in the facilities management business 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization include amounts included as a component of cost of revenue  which are primarily related to laundry and microfridge equipment in the field  and amounts included as an operating expense  which are primarily non revenue generating corporate assets 
aggregate depreciation and amortization decreased by  or  from year ended december   to  for the year ended december  depreciation expense of property  plant and equipment remained flat when compared to due to the fact that the amount spent by the company on capital expenditures has not changed significantly in the last several years 
amortization expense has decreased by  in as compared to  primarily due to the effect of the adoption of fas on january  had goodwill been amortized in   would have been charged to income 
in   of goodwill amortization was charged to income 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales increased by  or  from the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  gross margins on product sales were for both the years ended december  and the gross margin on product sales includes laundry and microfridge equipment sales 
the gross margin in the laundry equipment sales business improved from in to in this increase was primarily attributable to changes in product sales mix  price increases on selected products and a shift from selling some products through other commercial distributors to selling directly to the end users at higher margins 
the gross margin associated with microfridge equipment sales remained the same at for the years ended december  and this sales margin was the net of several factors  including changes in sales mix between the academic  hotel and government divisions  competitive pressure in the microfridge markets  particularly the hotel market where the company made price concessions to secure sales  and increased sales of larger refrigerator units  which have lower gross margins than smaller units 
also affecting the gross margin of equipment sales was the improvement in  as compared to  of the gross margin earned from laundry equipment sales to the government 
general  administration  sales and marketing expense 
general  administration  sales and marketing expenses increased by from the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  general  administration  sales and marketing expenses were and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising  insurance  reserve for doubtful accounts and professional fees 
the increase in advertising was primarily in the microfridge business  followed by the laundry equipment sales business 
in both of these businesses  increased advertising expenditures were in reaction to the effect of the general economic downturn

on january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
as a result of an evaluation conducted by an independent third party valuation firm  it was determined that the fair value of the laundry and microfridge reporting units exceeded their book value  therefore no impairment of goodwill occurred in these reporting units 
however  due to the continued decline in the services of the reprographics reporting unit as a result of expanding use of the internet and access to free laser printers in college and public libraries  the book value of the reprographics reporting unit exceeded the fair value  resulting in a non cash write off of the remaining book value of the reporting unit s goodwill in the period ended march   of  or per share 
seasonality the company experiences moderate seasonality as a result of its significant operations in the college and university market 
revenues derived from the college and university market represented approximately of the company s total revenue for academic facilities management revenues are derived substantially during the school year in the first  second and fourth calendar quarters

the company reviews long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets with definitive lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
in accordance with fas  the company tests its goodwill annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
the goodwill impairment review consists of a two step process of first determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit 
fair values of the reporting units were determined based on estimates of comparable market price or discounted future cash flows 
if this fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further analysis or goodwill impairment charge is required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the underlying assets and liabilities  including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets  based on their fair value 
if necessary  goodwill is then written down to its fair value 
on january   in connection with the initial application of fas  the company recognized an impairment charge of financial instruments 
the company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb no 
fas 
these statements require the company to recognize derivatives on its balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
if the derivative is a hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings  depending on the intended use of the derivative 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  the change in fair value of the agreements is recognized in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of the change is recognized in earnings immediately 
fair value of financial instruments 
for purposes of financial reporting  the company has determined that the fair value of financial instruments approximates book value at december  and  based upon terms currently available to the company in financial markets 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the reporting date  taking into account current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the counter party 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of the guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
this interpretation also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded 
the company has adopted the disclosure provisions of this pronouncement as of december  the adoption of the financial provisions of fin on january  had no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
fin requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity must be included in the consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
fin  as revised in december  must be applied at the end of periods ending after march   and is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  our management does not believe that the adoption of the revised fin will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position  as at this time we are not a party to any variable interest entities 
we will apply the consolidation requirement of fin in future periods if we should own any interest in any variable interest entity 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under fas fas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  except for the provisions that were cleared by the fasb in prior pronouncements 
the adoption of fas on july  had no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity fas 
fas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
fas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities 
it is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the fas and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
restatement is not permitted 
the adoption of fas on july  had no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
risk factors this annual report on form k contains statements which are not historical facts and are considered forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements contain projections of the company s future results of operations or financial position or state other forward looking information 
in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will and would or similar words 
you should not rely on forward looking statements  because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond the company s control 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors may cause the company s actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that might cause these differences are as follows the company s cash flows may not be sufficient to finance the significant capital expenditures required to replace equipment and implement new technology 
the company must continue to make capital expenditures in order to replace existing equipment 
while it is anticipated that existing capital resources  as well as cash from operations  will be adequate to finance anticipated capital expenditures  the company cannot guarantee the investor that the company s resources or cash flows will be sufficient 
to the extent that available resources are insufficient to fund capital requirements  the company may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or curtail certain capital expenditures 
such financings may not be available or available only on less favorable terms and  in the case of equity financings  could result in dilution to its stockholders 
indebtedness may limit the company s use of cash flow and restrict its flexibility 
in the event the company is unable to decrease the outstanding indebtedness under its credit facility  the increased indebtedness could require use of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to make payments on indebtedness  leaving less cash flow available for other purposes  materially limit or impair the company s ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  general corporate or other purposes  and reduce flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 
failure to comply with credit facility covenants may result in an acceleration of substantial indebtedness the credit facility requires the company to comply with various financial and other operating covenants on a quarterly basis 
failure to comply with any of these covenants  without obtaining a waiver from the lender  would permit the lender to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
an acceleration of the credit facility would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
these financial covenants consist of various leverage ratios and other targets  including maximum total leverage  maximum capital expenditures and restricted payments 
if the company were unable to renew its laundry leases the company s results of operations and business could be adversely affected 
the business is highly dependent upon the renewal of leases with property owners  colleges and universities and public housing authorities 
these leases have an average length of seven to ten years with approximately to coming up for renewal each year 
mac gray has traditionally relied upon exclusive  long term leases with its customers  as well as frequent customer interaction and a historical emphasis on customer service  to assure continuity of financial and operating results 
the company cannot guarantee investors that it will be able to continue to secure long term exclusive leases with customers on favorable terms  it will be able to successfully renew existing leases as they expire  or it will not experience a loss of business if apartment vacancy rates increase of if property owners or management companies choose to vacate properties as a result of economic downturns that affect occupancy levels 
failure by the company to continue to obtain long term exclusive leases with a substantial number of its customers  or to successfully renew existing leases as they expire  could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and business 
competition on local and national levels may hinder the company s ability to expand 
the card coin operated laundry services industry is highly competitive  both locally and nationally 
on the local level  private businesses tend to have long standing relationships with property owners and managers in their specific geographic market 
on the national level  there are two competitors with larger installed machine bases than mac gray 
these larger companies tend to have significant operational and managerial resources to devote to expansion and to capture additional market share 
these competitive forces may increase purchase prices for future acquisitions to levels that make the acquisitions less attractive or uneconomical 
accordingly  the company cannot assure that it will be able to compete effectively in any specific geographic location in the business of supplying laundry equipment services to property owners and managers or in the acquisition of other businesses 
if the company is unable to continue its relationships with maytag and other suppliers  the company s profit margins could be reduced and its ability to meet customer requirements could be adversely impacted 
currently the company purchases a majority of the equipment that it uses in the laundry facilities management business from maytag 
in addition  the company derives a significant amount of its non laundry facilities management revenue  as well as competitive advantages  from its position as a distributor of maytag commercial laundry products 
although either party  upon written notice  may terminate the agreements between the company and maytag  maytag has never terminated any agreement with the company 
the company s relationship with maytag dates from in addition  the company currently procures the products used by the microfridge segment from a limited number of suppliers 
if maytag or any of these other suppliers terminated or demanded a substantial revision of the contracts or business relationships currently in place  there may be a delay in finding a replacement  and an inability to find terms as favorable as the current terms  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations or its ability to meet customer demands 
the microfridge segment has a non competition agreement with sanyo whereby sanyo is precluded from entering the microfridge market  provided that certain minimum annual quantities of products are purchased from sanyo 
the company s ability to make acquisitions depends upon its ability to access capital on acceptable terms 
partial success of the company s long term growth strategy is dependent upon its ability to identify  finance and consummate acquisitions on acceptable financial terms 
access to capital is subject to the following risks use of common stock as acquisition consideration may result in dilution to stockholders  if the common stock does not maintain a sufficient valuation or if potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept shares of the company s common stock  then the company will be required to use more cash resources or other consideration to make acquisitions  if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash for acquisitions from existing operations  its ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected unless it is able to obtain additional capital through external financings or to borrow sufficient amounts  and funding the acquisition program through debt financing will result in additional leverage 
growth strategy may not be successful if the company is unable to acquire and integrate new businesses 
the company s long term growth strategy depends  in part  on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate and operate additional businesses 
while the company generally believes that the management team and business structure currently in place enables it to operate a significantly larger and more diverse operation  it may be exposed to the following risks in connection with finding  completing  and successfully integrating acquisitions the inability to effectively and efficiently integrate the assets of the acquired business  the inability to increase the revenue and profit of the acquired business  the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of money and time integrating acquired businesses  particularly operations located in new regions and operations involving new lines of business 
failure to successfully integrate the business acquired from web would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations on january  the company acquired the eastern laundry facility assets of web 
the majority of these assets are in the company s existing geographical markets 
there can be no guarantee that a successful integration of these assets will occur 
failure to successfully complete the integration could adversely effect the overall results and financial strength of the company 
multi housing vacancy rates could effect revenue from the operations of laundry route contracts 
consistency of revenue from the operations of vended laundry equipment  particularly in the multi housing industry  depends partially upon the level of tenant occupancy 
the number of apartments occupied in an apartment building with a vended laundry room can directly affect the company s revenue 
the level of occupancy can be adversely affected by many market economic conditions  including local economic slowdowns  and corresponding increases in unemployment rate oversupply of apartments lower mortgage interest rates which encourage apartment dwellers to purchase homes the microfridge products may be susceptible to product liability claims for which insurance may not be adequate 
through the microfridge segment  the company markets and distributes microfridge  a combination refrigerator freezer microwave oven 
the sale and distribution of microfridge  as well as other products  entails a risk of product liability claims 
further  although microfridge is manufactured by third parties under contract with microfridge  microfridge may be subject to risks of product liability claims related to this manufacture 
potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage 
the company cannot assure investors that it will be able to renew existing insurance at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that currently in effect  if at all 
in the event that the microfridge segment is held liable for a claim against which it is not indemnified or for damages exceeding the limits of insurance coverage  the claim could have a material adverse effect on business 
reliance upon common law and contractual intellectual property rights may be insufficient to protect the company from adverse claims 
the company relies upon certain trademark  service mark  copyright  patent and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure and non solicitation agreements and other methods to protect proprietary rights 
periodically the company makes filings with the patent and trademark office to protect some of its proprietary rights  although the company has traditionally relied upon the protections afforded by contract rights and through common law ownership rights 
the company cannot assure investors that these contract rights and legal claims to ownership will adequately protect the operations from adverse claims 
in addition  any adverse claims or litigation  with or without merit  could be costly and could divert management s attention from the operation of the business 
certain stockholders  directors and executive officers could exercise control and prevent a sale or merger 
as of march   mac gray s directors  executive officers  and certain of its stockholders and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
this percentage ownership does not include options to purchase  shares of the common stock held by some of these persons  all of which are currently exercisable 
if these affiliates exercised any of their options  then the ownership of common stock would be further concentrated 
as a result of this concentration in ownership  these stockholders  acting together  have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of the election of directors and all other matters requiring approval by a majority of stockholders 
matters requiring stockholder approval include significant corporate transactions  such as mergers and sales of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
the concentration of ownership in affiliates  together  in some cases  with specific provisions of the company s charter and bylaws  as described below  and applicable sections of the corporate law of delaware  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of mac gray 
provisions of the company s charter  bylaws  delaware law  and the shareholder rights agreement could have the effect of discouraging takeovers 
specific provisions of the company s charter and bylaws  as described below  sections of the corporate law of delaware  the shareholder rights agreement  and powers of the board of directors may discourage takeover attempts not first approved by the board of directors  including takeovers which some stockholders may deem to be in their best interests 
these provisions and powers of the board of directors could delay or prevent the removal of incumbent directors or the assumption of control by stockholders  even if the particular removal or assumption of control would be beneficial to stockholders 
these provisions and powers of the board of directors could also discourage or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  even if these events would be beneficial  in the short term  to the interests of stockholders 
the anti takeover provisions and powers of the board of directors include  among other things the ability of the board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to establish the voting rights  preferences and other terms of such preferred stock  a classified board of directors serving staggered three year terms  the elimination of stockholder voting by written consent  the absence of cumulative voting for directors  the removal of directors only for cause  the vesting of exclusive authority in the board of directors to determine the size of the board of directors and  subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock  if issued  to fill vacancies thereon  the vesting of exclusive authority in the board of directors  except as otherwise required by law  to call special meetings of stockholders  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board of directors  ownership restrictions  under the corporate law of delaware  with limited exceptions  upon acquirers including their affiliates and associates of or more of its common stock  and the company s entry into a shareholder rights agreement providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or more of the common shares unless the rights are redeemed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates on its borrowings 
in the normal course of its business  the company manages its exposure to these risks as described below 
the company does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rates the table below provides information about the company s debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the fair market value of long term debt approximates book value at december  expected maturity date in thousands december  thereafter total long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate      average interest rate on june   the company terminated its two  interest rate swap agreements  which had been in effect since february and january  respectively 
the january interest rate swap agreement was due to expire in february while the february interest rate swap agreement was due to expire in february the company paid  to terminate both the february and january swap agreements 
the accumulated other comprehensive losses related to the terminated interest rate swap agreements are reclassified against current period earnings in the same period the forecasted interest payments affect earnings 
upon termination  there was  net of taxes of  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the associated with the january interest rate swap agreement will be reclassified as an earnings charge through february and the  associated with the february interest rate swap agreement will be reclassified as an earnings charge through february on june   as required by the senior secured credit facility  the company entered into two standard international swaps and derivatives association isda interest rate swap agreements the swap agreements to manage the interest rate risk associated with its senior secured credit facility 
the company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges 
each agreement has a notional amount of  and a maturity date in june the first interest rate swap agreement has a fixed notional amount throughout its term and a fixed rate of 
the second interest rate swap agreement contains an amortization provision and a fixed rate of 
the notional amount of this agreement at december  was  in accordance with the swap agreements and on a quarterly basis  interest expense is calculated based on the floating day libor and the fixed rate 
if interest expense as calculated is greater based on the day libor  the financial institution pays the difference to the company  if interest expense as calculated is greater based on the fixed rate  the company pays the difference to the financial institution 
depending on fluctuations in the libor  the company s interest rate exposure and its related impact on interest expense and net cash flow may increase or decrease 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the swap agreement  however  nonperformance is not anticipated 
the fair value of the swap agreements is the estimated amount that the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the reporting date  taking into account current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the counter party 
at december   the fair value of the swap agreements  net of related taxes  was an unrealized gain of this amount has been included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
on february   as required by the amended senior secured credit facility  the company entered into an additional isda interest rate swap agreement to manage the interest rate risk associated with its amended senior secured credit facility 
this agreement has a notional amount of  and a maturity date in february the interest rate swap agreement has a fixed notional amount throughout its term and a fixed rate of 
prior to its termination in june  the ineffective portion of the january interest rate swap agreement resulted in income  after the effect of related income taxes  for the years ended december  and of and  respectively 
as of december   there was  outstanding under the term loan and  outstanding under the revolving line of credit  and the unused balance under the revolving line of credit was  the average interest rate was approximately at december
