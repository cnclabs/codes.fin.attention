liquidity and capital resources the company s primary cash requirements are for operating expenses and capital expenditures 
these cash requirements have historically been met through a combination of cash flow from operations  equipment leasing  issuance of industrial revenue bonds and bank lines of credit 
cash provided by operating activities in totaled  an increase in accounts payable contributed  to cash flows from operating activities due to timing differences 
in addition  the increase in the postretirement benefits liability of  is not a current cash obligation  and this item will not be a cash obligation until retirees begin to utilize their retirement medical benefits 
partially offsetting the above mentioned increases in cash flows from operating activities was an increase in accounts receivable of  primarily due to increased sales volumes in the final two months of the year

monthly payments of principal in the amount  are payable under this note through january  effective january   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which is designated as a cash flow hedge of the bank loan 
under this agreement  the company pays a fixed rate of to the bank and receives libor plus basis points 
the swap term and notional amount matches the payment schedule on the secured note payable with final maturity in january while the company is exposed to credit loss on its interest rate swap in the event of non performance by the counterparty to the swap  management believes such non performance is unlikely to occur given the financial resources of the counterparty 
at december   the company had cash on hand of  and an available line of credit of  which is scheduled to mature on april  as of december   the company was in compliance with both of its financial debt covenants for the borrowings 
the covenants relate to maintaining certain financial ratios

the company has the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  including purchase obligations  as defined by the united states securities and exchange commission 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on the company s balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
based on this definition  the tables below include only those contracts  which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
the following table provides aggregated information about contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  and after total debt      operating lease obligations      contractual commitments for capital expenditures   postretirement benefits      total      critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  post retirement benefits  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december  management also records estimates for customer returns  discounts offered to customers  and for price adjustments 
should customer returns  discounts  and price adjustments fluctuate from the estimated amounts  additional allowances may be required 
the company had recorded an allowance for these chargebacks of  at december  and  at december  inventories management identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related to these inventories based on expectations of future usage 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant 
should actual results differ from these estimates  additional provisions may be required 
the company had recorded an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory of  at december  and  at december  goodwill and long lived assets management evaluates whether impairment exists for goodwill and long lived assets 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine impairment  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  decreases in future cash flows from operating activities below the assumptions could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to recover its long lived assets 
the company has not recorded any impairment to goodwill for long lived assets for the years ended december  and post retirement benefits management records an accrual for post retirement costs associated with the company sponsored health care plan 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine the reserves  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  increases in future healthcare costs above the assumptions could have an adverse affect on the company s operations 
the effect of a change in healthcare costs is described in the notes to the financial statements 
the company had recorded a liability for post retirement medical benefits based on actuarially computed estimates of  at december  and  at december  income taxes management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance and the amount of the valuation allowance recorded 
the valuation allowance will be adjusted as the company determines the actual amount of deferred tax assets that will be realized 
the company had recorded a valuation allowance of  at december  and at december  the balance sheet at december  and includes a deferred tax asset of  and  net of a valuation allowance of  in and the deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance since it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized in the future 
the deferred tax asset at december   primarily includes the tax benefits associated with cumulative net operating losses of approximately  temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the company s property and equipment of approximately  and temporary differences relating to post retirement and pension benefits of  the valuation allowance at december   assumes that it is more likely than not that approximately  of the cumulative net operating losses will not be realized before their expiration date 
an analysis is performed to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset that will be realized 
such analysis is based upon the premise that the company is and will continue as a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of the company using a number of alternatives to evaluate financial results in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
other factors considered are the company s long standing relationship with its two largest customers international and yamaha  and the company s recent customer diversification efforts and the refinancing of notes payable at a lower interest rate 
the projected availability of taxable income to realize the tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of temporary differences before expiration of these benefits are also considered 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies and the maintenance of its relationships with its key customers  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of  inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
management believes that  because rates of inflation have been moderate during the periods presented  inflation has not had a significant impact on our results of operations
