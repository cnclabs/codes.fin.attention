the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of data integration and business intelligence software 
we generate revenues from sales of software licenses and services  which consist of maintenance  consulting and training 
our license revenues are derived from our data integration and business intelligence software products  as well as our analytic application suites and data warehouse modules  which we ceased selling directly in july we receive software license revenues from licensing our products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  distributors and oems 
we receive service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services and training that we perform for customers that license our products either directly or indirectly 
we license our software and provide services to all industry sectors  including financial services  communications  pharmaceuticals  insurance  manufacturing  utilities  government and retail 
we sell our products through both our own direct sales forces and indirect channel partners in the united states as well as belgium  canada  france  germany  the netherlands  switzerland  the united kingdom  asia pacific  australia  europe  japan and latin america 
substantially all of our international sales have been in europe 
revenue outside of europe and north america  which includes the united states and canada  have been or less of total consolidated revenues during the last three years  although we anticipate further expansion outside of these two regions in the future 
during  we launched a new version of powercenter  our core data integration product offering  acquired striva corporation to enhance our ability to address our customer s mainframe data integration needs  launched superglue  our integrated metadata solution and released a fully upgraded version of poweranalyzer  our business intelligence platform 
in addition  we exited the applications and data warehouse business in july to better focus our resources on providing infrastructure solutions and to strengthen relationships with several of our indirect channel partners 
in  revenues grew by over to million in  with much of this growth occurring in the second half of the year 
in addition  we returned to profitability on a full year basis  generating net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year 
contribution from our new offerings coupled with the increase in services revenue  mostly from increased maintenance revenue driven by strong renewals from our expanding customer base  more than offset the loss of analytical application suite and data warehouse module revenue 
we increased our gross profit percentage to based on the combination of the increase in total revenues and decrease in cost of revenues  particularly royalties to third party software providers 

table of contents adjustments to previously announced quarterly and annual results in the fourth quarter of  we discovered an error in the allocation of revenues between license and service components in accordance with statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
this allocation had been applied consistently from the fourth quarter of we immediately corrected the error in the fourth quarter of we will not be amending any of our periodic reports previously filed with the sec or revising any results prior to however  we adjusted our previously reported quarterly results in note  selected quarterly consolidated financial data unaudited  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item to account for the error 
acquisition of striva corporation on september   we acquired striva corporation  a privately held mainframe data integration software vendor 
the acquisition extends our data integration and business intelligence software to include striva s mainframe technology for high speed bulk data movement and solution for real time change data capture in legacy and non legacy environments 
we expect this combination to allow us to extend the reach of our enterprise data integration and business intelligence products in order to meet the growing customer demand for mainframe data integration across transactional  operational and analytical systems 
we believe that it is the investment value of this synergy related to future product offerings that principally contributed to a purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill 
prior to the acquisition  we had an oem relationship with striva whereby we integrated striva s bulk data movement technology as part of our product offering 
we paid million  consisting of million of cash and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million  to acquire all of the outstanding common and preferred shares of striva  including the assumption by us of all of the outstanding stock options issued pursuant to striva s stock option plan  which became options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the total purchase price of striva was allocated to the acquired assets  including goodwill and identified intangible assets  and assumed liabilities at their fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
the results of striva s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition 
see note  business combinations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item  which contains additional information regarding the acquisition critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals in the united states  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item  which contains additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we follow detailed revenue recognition guidelines  which are discussed below 
we recognize revenue in accordance with gaap guidance that has been prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue 
table of contents recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments  such as determining if collectibility is probable and if a customer is credit worthy 
we recognize revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop software revenue recognition  as amended and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we recognize license revenues when a noncancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been shipped or we have provided the customer with the access codes that allow for immediate possession of the software collectively delivered  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price  which does not change before the element is made generally available  is established by authorized management 
if an acceptance period is required  we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period if all other revenue recognition criteria under sop have been satisfied 
credit worthiness and collectibility for end users are first assessed on a country level and then  for those customers in countries deemed to have sufficient timely payment history  customers are assessed based on payment history and credit profile 
for the data integration products  data warehouse modules  and business intelligence platform sold directly to end users  we recognize revenue upon delivery when collectibility is probable  after all other criteria for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
we ceased selling data warehouse modules in july when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized upon cash receipt  after all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
for our analytic application suites  which we ceased selling directly in july  we recognize both the license and maintenance revenue ratably over the initial maintenance period  generally one year  since we do not have vsoe of maintenance for our analytic application suites 
our standard agreements do not contain product return rights 
we also enter into reseller and distributor arrangements that typically provide for sublicense or end user license fees based on a percentage of list prices 
revenue arrangements with resellers and distributors require evidence of sell through  that is  persuasive evidence that the products have been sold to an identified end user 
for data integration products  data warehouse modules and business intelligence platform sold indirectly through our resellers and distributors  we recognize revenue upon delivery and receipt of evidence of sell through if the reseller or distributor has been deemed credit worthy 
we ceased selling data warehouse modules in july credit worthiness and collectibility for resellers and distributors are first assessed on a country level and then  for resellers and distributors in countries deemed to have sufficient timely payment history  resellers and distributors are assessed based on established credit history consisting of sales of at least one million dollars and with timely payment history  generally for the last months 
when resellers and distributors are not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized upon cash receipt  after all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
we also enter into oem arrangements that provide for license fees based on inclusion of our products in the oems products 
these arrangements provide for fixed  irrevocable royalty payments 
credit worthiness and collectibility for oems are first assessed on a country level and then  for those oems in countries deemed to have sufficient timely payment history  oems are assessed based on established credit history consisting of sales of at least one million dollars and with timely payment history  generally for the last months 
for credit worthy oems  royalty payments are recognized based on the activity in the royalty report we receive from the oem  or in the case of oems with fixed royalty payments  revenue is recognized when the related payment is due 
when oems are not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized upon cash receipt 
in both cases  revenue is recognized after all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
we recognize maintenance revenues  which consist of fees for ongoing support and product updates and upgrades  ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services and product enhancements performed on a time and materials basis or  on a very infrequent basis  a fixed fee arrangement under separate service arrangements related to the installation and implementation of our software products 
training revenues are generated from classes offered at our headquarters  sales offices and customer locations 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as the services are performed 
when a contract includes both license and service elements  the 
table of contents license fee is recognized on delivery of the software or cash collections  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the base product  and are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software and the payment terms for licenses are not dependent on additional acceptance criteria 
deferred revenue includes deferred license  maintenance  consulting and training revenue 
our practice is to net unpaid deferred items against the related receivables balances from those oems  specific resellers  distributors and specific international customers for which we defer revenue until payment is received 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for sales returns on revenue in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates require management judgment and are based on historical sales returns and other known factors 
if these estimates do not adequately reflect future sales returns  revenue could be overstated 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due to us 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
for example  we recorded an additional bad debt expense in related to customers that filed for bankruptcy 
impairment of goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment  we have determined that there is only one reporting unit  specifically the license  implementation and support of our software products 
goodwill was tested for impairment on the adoption of sfas on january  and in the annual impairment tests on october  and using the two step process required by sfas first  we reviewed the carrying amount of the reporting unit compared to the fair value of the reporting unit based on quoted market prices of our common stock and the discounted cash flows based on analyses prepared by management 
an excess carrying value compared to fair value would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
second  if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  then we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
based on these estimates  we determined that as of october  and there were no indications of impairment of goodwill 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
accordingly  future changes in market capitalization or estimates used in discounted cash flows analyses could result in significantly different fair values of the reporting unit  which may result in impairment of goodwill 
restructuring charges during and  we recorded significant charges in connection with our excess facilities 
the accrued restructuring charges represent gross lease obligations and estimated commissions and other costs principally leasehold improvements and asset write offs  offset by estimated gross sublease income expected to be received over the remaining lease terms 

table of contents if we determine that there is further deterioration in the estimated sublease rates or in the expected time to sublease our vacant space  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future and our cash position could be adversely affected 
for example  we recorded a restructuring charge in related to our excess facilities and took an additional charge in for the excess facilities based on the continued deterioration in the real estate market and low sublease rates 
see note  restructuring charges  of notes to consolidated financial statements in item future adjustments to the charges could result from a change in the time period that the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease rate  expected sublease terms and the estimated time to sublease 
we will periodically assess the need to update the original restructuring charges based on the current real estate market information and trend analysis and executed sublease agreements 
these liabilities include management s estimates pertaining to sublease activities 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
we will continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market conditions periodically to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable based on current and expected commercial real estate market conditions 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors which may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
deferred taxes we recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce all of our deferred tax assets to the amount that is likely to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however  if it were determined that we would be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period in which such determination was made 
likewise  if we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 

table of contents years ended december   and the following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data revenues license service total revenues cost of revenues license service amortization of acquired technology total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of stock based compensation amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets purchased in process research and development restructuring charges total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income and other  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision net income loss cost of license revenues  as a percentage of license revenues cost of service revenues  as a percentage of service revenues amortization of acquired technology has been reclassified for the two years ended december  from amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 

table of contents revenues our total revenues increased to million in from million in and million in  representing growth of million or in from and a decrease of million or in from our license revenues decreased to million in from million in and million in  representing a decrease of million or in from and million or in from the decrease in license revenue from to was primarily due to the continued weak information technology it spending conditions in which negatively impacted license revenues 
in we experienced a decrease in the number of end user transactions and a decrease in the average transaction amount  which decreased from  in to  in additionally  a million negative adjustment in to correct the overallocation of license revenues and underallocation of service revenues resulting from an error in the allocation of revenue see adjustments to previously announced quarterly and annual results above resulted in a further decrease of license revenue 
the million decrease in license revenue in from was due to weak global economic conditions  resulting in a decrease in the number of transactions  partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount  which increased from  in to  in or 
our average end user transaction amounts do not include large oem transactions  small distributor transactions or add on transactions  which are not reflective of typical end user transactions 
service revenues increased to million in from million in and million in  representing growth of million or in from and million or in from these increases were primarily due to increases of million and in maintenance revenues in and  respectively  which were associated with an increased customer base and strong renewals of maintenance contracts 
additionally  in  we made a million positive adjustment to increase maintenance revenues to correct the underallocation of maintenance revenues resulting from an error in the allocation of revenue see adjustments to previously announced quarterly and annual results above 
the increase in maintenance revenues in was partially offset by a million decrease in consulting and training revenues  which was the result of fewer billable consultants performing implementation and training services 
professional services were relatively flat from to for  we expect maintenance revenues to slightly increase based on our growing installed customer base  and we expect contributions from consulting and training revenues to remain relatively consistent with the levels 
our international revenues were million in  million in and million in  representing an increase of million  or  in from and a decrease of million  or  in from the million increase in from in international revenues was primarily due to a increase in maintenance revenues in europe due to a strong renewal base 
international license fees and consulting services from to remained relatively constant 
the million decrease in from in international revenues was due primarily to a decrease in license revenues in europe due to the weak macroeconomic environment  partially offset by increases in service revenues of due to our expanded customer base and strong renewals and increased consulting and training revenue 
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and for  and  respectively 
as a result of these license revenue trends and continued uncertainty in it spending by our customers and prospects  our ability to meet our forecasted sales for will continue to be highly dependent on our success in converting our sales pipeline into license revenues from orders received and shipped within the year 
in particular  the general economic uncertainty has caused customer purchases to be reduced in amount  deferred or cancelled  and therefore has reduced the overall license pipeline conversion rates in and much of and could continue to reduce the rate of conversion of the sales pipeline into license revenue in the future 
see risk factors if we are unable to accurately forecast revenues  we may fail to meet stock analysts and investors expectations of our quarterly operating results  which could cause our stock price to decline  risk factors we have experienced a reduced sales pipeline and pipeline conversion rate  which has adversely affected the growth of our company and the price of our common stock 

table of contents in july  we ceased direct sales of our analytic application suites and data warehouse modules  which we made available to our indirect channel partners to sell 
we will not receive any future revenue from the distribution of our analytic application suites and data warehouse modules from our independent channel partners 
we will make appropriate efforts to provide support to our existing analytic application customers and to encourage our existing and prospective customers to work with our independent channel partners 
we may further use or sell elements of this technology in the future  which may generate revenues 
in december  we licensed elements of this software technology to one of our strategic partners 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
in particular  our license revenues are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
in addition  we have historically recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of each quarter  and more recently  in the last few weeks of each quarter 
see risk factors we have experienced and could continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  especially the amount of license revenue we recognize each quarter  and such fluctuations have caused and could continue to cause our stock price to decline 
cost of revenues cost of license revenues our cost of license revenues consists primarily of software royalties  product packaging  documentation  and production costs 
cost of license revenues was million in  million in and million in  representing approximately  and of license revenues in  and  respectively 
the million or decrease in from was primarily due to decreased royalty payments  including royalty payments to striva  which we ceased making following our acquisition of striva in september in addition  we renegotiated a royalty bearing contract with one of our partners to decrease the royalty fee 
the million or increase in from was due primarily to increases in our percentage mix of royalty bearing products 
for  we expect the cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues to remain relatively consistent with the level 
cost of service revenues our cost of service revenues is a combination of costs of maintenance  consulting and training revenues 
our cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of costs associated with customer service personnel expenses and royalty fees to third party software providers 
cost of consulting revenues consists primarily of personnel costs and expenses incurred in providing consulting services at customers facilities 
cost of training revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing training classes and materials at our headquarters  sales and training offices and customer locations 
cost of service revenues was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of service revenues in  and  respectively 
cost of service revenues in absolute dollars remained relatively flat in compared to  but as a percentage of service revenues decreased primarily due to the significant increase in maintenance revenue  which had less cost associated with it than other types of service revenue 
the decrease of in compared to resulted primarily from a decrease in consulting service personnel costs from headcount reductions 
for  we expect our cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues to remain relatively constant with the level 
amortization of acquired technology amortization of acquired technology is the amortization of technologies acquired through business combinations 
see additional discussion at amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets below 
amortization of acquired technology totaled million in each of the years ended december   and for  we expect amortization of acquired technology to be approximately million  the increase resulting from our acquisition of striva in september 
table of contents operating expenses research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses and consulting services associated with the development of new products  the enhancement and localization of existing products  quality assurance and development of documentation for our products 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the million or increase in from was due primarily to increases in outside consulting services totaling million and personnel related costs of million 
research and development expenses decreased slightly to million in from million in research and development expenses represented of total revenues in each of  and to date  all software and development costs have been expensed in the period incurred because costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant 
for  we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues to remain relatively consistent with or slightly below the level 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including commissions  as well as costs of public relations  seminars  marketing programs  lead generation  travel and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses were consistent at million in from million in while sales and marketing expenses remained effectively flat from to  a few components of the expense fluctuated  including lower outside consulting service fees of million  offset by higher marketing and advertising related expenses of million 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease of million or from to was due primarily to decreased personnel related costs of million  which included decreased commission expense of million and recruiting related expenses of million  with the remaining personnel related decrease due to headcount reductions 
sales and marketing expenses represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
for  we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues to remain relatively consistent with the level 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  legal and general management  as well as professional services expense associated with recruiting  legal and accounting 
general and administrative expenses increased slightly to million in from million in the million or increase in expenses in from was primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs and million in fees paid to outside professional service providers and other administrative fees  partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense totaling million 
the decrease in the bad debt expense was a result of a significantly decreased customer bankruptcy rate 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million or increase was due primarily to increased outside professional service provider fees of million partially offset by decreased personnel costs of million 
general and administrative expenses represented of our total revenues in fiscal years  and we expect that for  our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues to remain relatively consistent with or slightly below our level in amortization of stock based compensation amortization of stock based compensation amounted to million in  million in and million in the increase in was primarily related to the amortization of the deferred compensation recorded in connection with the september striva acquisition 
the million decrease in from was primarily due to amortization of million in amortization for stock based compensation related to the acceleration of options for a terminated executive 
we expect to record 
table of contents million in for the amortization of stock based compensation related to the fixed awards issued in conjunction with the striva acquisition 
in  we granted a stock option to our ceo that is based on future performance of the company 
the variable term of the option is such that it requires us to periodically remeasure the value of the grant based on the fair value of the stock and record related stock based compensation 
the stock based compensation related to this grant for was  if the fair market value of our common stock in were to remain consistent with the closing price at the end of  we would expect to record amortization of stock based compensation related to this grant of approximately million in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets we have acquired 
other intangible assets includes patents and customer relationships 
we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of striva corporation in  syn t sys and informatica partners in and delphi solutions ag  zimba and qrb developers in as well as the strategic alliance with pricewaterhousecoopers pwc in as required by sfas  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of january  we will continue to amortize other intangible assets on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  excluding acquired technology  amounted to million in both and and million in the significant decrease in from is due to the adoption of sfas  which was effective january  we expect amortization expense to be approximately million for  excluding the amortization of acquired technology  which is recognized as a component of cost of revenues 
it is likely that we will continue to expand our business both through acquisitions and internal development 
any additional acquisitions could result in additional merger and acquisition related expenses and any impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets could result in incremental expense 
purchased in process research and development based on our valuation of identified intangible assets held by striva when we acquired it in september  million of the total purchase price was allocated to purchased in process research and development  which was expensed in the quarter ended september   in accordance with fin see note  business combinations  of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges in september  we announced a restructuring plan and recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  consisting of million related to estimated facility lease losses and million in leasehold improvement and asset write offs related to the consolidation of excess leased facilities in the san francisco bay area and texas 
in september  we recorded additional restructuring charges of approximately million  consisting of million related to estimated facility lease losses and million in leasehold improvement and asset write offs 
the timing of the restructuring accrual adjustment was a result of negotiated and executed subleases for our excess facilities in dallas  texas and palo alto  california during the third quarter of these subleases included terms that provided a lower level of sublease rates than the initial assumptions 
the terms of these new subleases were consistent with the continued deterioration of the commercial real estate market in these areas 
in addition  cost containment measures initiated in the same quarter  such as delayed hiring and salary reductions  resulted in an adjustment to our estimate of occupancy of available vacant facilities 
these charges represent adjustments to the original assumptions including  the time period that the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease rates  expected sublease terms and the estimated time to sublease 
we calculated the estimated costs for the additional restructuring charges based on current market information and trend analysis of the real estate market in the respective area 

table of contents net cash payments for  and related to the consolidation of excess facilities amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
actual future cash requirements may differ from the restructuring liability balances as of december  if there are changes to the time period that facilities are vacant or the actual sublease income is different from current estimates 
as of december   million of lease termination costs  net of anticipated sublease income related to facilities to be subleased  remains accrued and is expected to be paid by our results of operations were positively affected by the decrease in rent expense  which approximates the cash payments  and decreases to non cash depreciation and amortization expense for the property and equipment written off  totaling million  million and million for  and  respectively 
for  we expect the effect on the results of operations to remain relatively consistent with or slightly below the level 
if we are unable to sublease any of the available vacant facilities during the remaining lease terms from the fourth quarter of through  restructuring charges could increase by approximately million 
we have actual sublease agreements for our excess facilities totaling million from the fourth quarter of through if we do not occupy certain available vacant facilities during the remaining lease terms from through  restructuring charges could increase by approximately an additional million 
interest income  interest expense and other income expense  net interest income is primarily interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash 
interest income and other  net was million in  million in and million in the million or increase in from was primarily a result of a misappropriation of trade secrets lawsuit settlement with ascential totaling million and a million decrease in losses on property and equipment  offset by million in lower interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted stock 
the million or decrease in from was primarily due to million in lower interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash  partially offset by million in foreign currency gains in and a million decrease in losses on property and equipment 
we currently do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities and  therefore  are susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange gains or losses in our results of operations in future reporting periods 
income tax provision we recorded an income tax provision of million in  million in and million in the million increase in from is primarily due to an overall increase in profitability 
the expected tax provision derived by applying the federal statutory rate to our pre tax income differed from the income tax provision recorded primarily due to a decrease in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to the extent of tax attributes utilized  offset by foreign taxes  alternative minimum taxes and non deductible amortization of deferred stock based compensation and intangibles 
the expected tax benefit derived by applying the federal statutory rate to our operating losses in fiscal and differed from the income tax provision recorded primarily due to an increase in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  non deductible amortization of deferred stock based compensation and merger related expenses 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity and requires such costs to be recognized when the liability is incurred 
previous guidance in eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity certain costs incurred in a restructuring required that a liability for an exit cost be recognized at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated by us after december  the adoption of sfas has not had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we adopted the disclosure requirements of fin as of december  we adopted the initial recognition and measurement of the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee  on a prospective basis  those guarantees issued or modified after december  fin has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was amended by fin r issued in december this interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity vie  formerly referred to as special purpose entities 
fin applies to any business enterprise  both public and private  that has a controlling interest  contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie 
fin provides guidance for determining when an entity  the primary beneficiary  should consolidate another entity  a vie  that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
fin applies immediately to vies created after january  it also applies in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march   to vies created before february  in which an enterprise holds a variable interest 
fin requires disclosure of vies in financial statements issued after january   if it is reasonably possible that as of the transition date the company will be the primary beneficiary of an existing vie that will require consolidation or  the company will hold a significant variable interest in  or have significant involvement with  an existing vie 
we currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie and do not have any such plans  and therefore the adoption is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

financing activities provided cash of million in  consisting principally of proceeds from the issuance of common stock to our employees 
we believe that our cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  because our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a decrease in customer demand or the acceptance of our products  we may not in the future be able to generate positive cash flows from operations 
if this occurred  we would require additional funds to support our working capital requirements  or for other purposes  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financings or from other sources 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time 
any financing we obtain may dilute your ownership interests 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases other purchase obligations commitments total contractual cash obligations other purchase obligations and commitments include minimum royalty payments under license agreements and do not include purchase obligations discussed below 

table of contents purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
operating leases we lease certain office facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases 
during and  we recorded restructuring charges related to the consolidation of excess leased facilities in the san francisco bay area and texas 
operating lease payments in the table below include approximately million  net of anticipated sublease income  for operating lease commitments for those facilities that are included in restructuring charges 
see note  lease obligations  to the consolidated financial statements in item during and  we signed sublease agreements for leased office space in palo alto  san francisco and redwood city  california and carrollton  texas 
under the sublease agreements  we will receive sublease income of million  million  million and million for   and  respectively 
in the event the sublessees are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the leases 
however  we expect the sublessees will fulfill their obligations under these leases 
in february  we entered into two lease agreements for new corporate headquarters in redwood city  california 
we occupied the new corporate headquarters in august the lease expires in july we paid for tenant improvements  primarily related to the exercise of build to suit options under the facility lease agreement 
the total cost of leasehold improvements for this facility through its completion in june was approximately million 
total expenditures for furniture  fixtures and equipment for this facility were approximately million 
as part of these agreements  we have purchased certificates of deposit totaling million as a security deposit for lease payments until certain financial milestones are met 
the letter of credit may be reduced to an amount not less than three months of the base rent at the then current rate if our annual revenues reach million and we have quarterly operating profits of at least million for no less than four consecutive calendar quarters 
these certificates of deposit are classified as long term restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
other uses of cash in september  our board of directors authorized a one year stock repurchase program for up to five million shares of our common stock 
purchases were made from time to time in the open market and were funded from available working capital 
the number and timing of shares purchased were based on the level of our cash balances  general business and market conditions  and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
under this program  we repurchased  and  shares of our common stock for million and million in and  respectively 
these shares were retired and reclassified as authorized and unissued shares of common stock 
on september   the company s one year stock repurchase program expired 
we may continue to execute share repurchases from time to time in order to take advantage of attractive share price levels  as determined by management and approved by the board of 
table of contents directors 
the timing and terms of the transactions will depend on market conditions  our liquidity and other considerations 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or transactions  arrangements or relationships with special purpose entities 

table of contents risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
we have experienced and could continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  especially the amount of license revenue we recognize each quarter  and such fluctuations have caused and could continue to cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations have caused our stock price to experience declines in the past and could cause our stock price to significantly fluctuate or experience declines in the future 
one of the reasons why our operating results have fluctuated is that our license revenues are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty and are vulnerable to short term shifts in customer demand 
for example  we have experienced customer order deferrals in anticipation of future new product introductions or product enhancements  as well as the particular budgeting and purchase cycles of our customers 
by comparison  our short term expenses are relatively fixed and based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
moreover  we do not have a substantial backlog of license orders at the end of a fiscal period 
therefore  our license revenues generally reflect orders shipped in the same quarter they are received  and as a result  we do not have significant visibility of expected results for future quarters 
furthermore  we have recognized a substantial portion of our license revenues in the last month of each quarter  and more recently  in the last few weeks of each quarter 
as a result  we cannot predict the adverse impact caused by cancellations or delays in orders until the end of each quarter 
due to the difficulty we experience in predicting our quarterly license revenues  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
furthermore  our future operating results could fail to meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors 
if this happens  the price of our common stock could fall 
if we are unable to accurately forecast revenues  we may fail to meet stock analysts and investors expectations of our quarterly operating results  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast sales and trends in our business 
our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals  including the date when they estimate that a customer will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale 
we aggregate these estimates periodically in order to generate a sales pipeline 
we compare the pipeline at various points in time to look for trends in our business 
while this pipeline analysis may provide us with some guidance in business planning and budgeting  these pipeline estimates are necessarily speculative and may not consistently correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
additionally  because we have historically recognized a substantial portion of our license revenues in the last month of each quarter  and more recently  in the last few weeks of each quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in a timely manner in response to variations in the conversion of the sales pipeline into license revenues 
any change in the conversion of the pipeline into customer sales or in the pipeline itself could cause us to improperly budget for future expenses that are in line with our expected future revenues  which would adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we have experienced a reduced sales pipeline and pipeline conversion rate  which has adversely affected the growth of our company and the price of our common stock 
in  we experienced a reduced conversion rate of our overall license pipeline  primarily as a result of the general economic slowdown which caused the amount of customer purchases to be reduced  deferred or cancelled 
in the first half of  we continued to experience a decrease in our sales pipeline as well as our pipeline conversion rate  primarily as a result of the negative impact of the war in iraq on the capital spending budgets of our customers  as well as the continued general economic slowdown 
while the us economy 
table of contents improved in the second half of  there is still uncertainty regarding our ability to convert potential sales of our products into revenue 
if we are unable to increase the size of our sales pipeline and our pipeline conversion rate  our results of operations could fail to meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
if we do not compete effectively with companies selling data integration and business intelligence products  our revenues may not grow and could decline 
the market for our products is highly competitive  quickly evolving and subject to rapidly changing technology 
our competition consists of hand coded  custom built data integration solutions developed in house by various companies in the industry segments that we target as well as other vendors of integration software products  including ascential software  embarcadero technologies  group software  sagent technologies and certain privately held companies 
in addition  we compete against business intelligence vendors that currently offer  or may develop  products with functionalities that compete with our products  such as brio technology  business objects  cognos  hyperion solutions  microstrategy and certain privately held companies 
we also compete against certain database and enterprise application vendors  which offer products that typically operate specifically with these competitors proprietary databases 
such potential competitors include ibm  microsoft  oracle  peoplesoft  sap and siebel systems 
many of these competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products and services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
we believe we currently compete more on the basis of our products functionality than on the basis of price 
if our competitors develop products with similar or superior functionality  we may have difficulty competing on the basis of price 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic partners  thereby limiting our ability to sell products through these channels 
additionally  if any of our current or potential competitors consolidate their operations  and as a result provide a broader suite of software products or solutions  our ability to market and sell our software products could be impaired 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce our prices  either of which could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not successfully integrate striva s technology  employees or business operations with our own 
as a result  we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition  which could adversely affect our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in september  we acquired striva corporation  a provider of mainframe data integration solutions 
the successful integration of striva s technology  employees and business operations will place an additional burden on our management and infrastructure 
this acquisition  and any others we may make in the future  will subject us to a number of risks  including the failure to capture the value of the business we acquired  including the loss of any key personnel  customers and business relationships  any inability to generate revenue from the combined products that offsets the associated acquisition and maintenance costs  and the assumption of any contracts or agreements from striva that contain terms or conditions that are unfavorable to us 

table of contents there can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with our striva acquisition or any future acquisitions 
to the extent that we are unable to successfully manage these risks  our business  operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected  and the price of our common stock could decline 
we rely on our relationships with our strategic partners 
if we do not maintain and strengthen these relationships  our ability to generate revenue and control implementation costs could be adversely affected  which would cause a decline in the price of our common stock 
we believe that our ability to increase the sales of our products depends in part upon maintaining and strengthening relationships with our strategic partners and any future strategic partners 
in addition to our direct sales force  we rely on established relationships with a variety of strategic partners  such as systems integrators  resellers and distributors  for marketing  licensing  implementing and supporting our products in the united states and internationally 
we also rely on relationships with strategic technology partners  such as enterprise application providers  database vendors and data quality vendors  for the promotion and implementation of our products 
our strategic partners offer products from several different companies  including  in some cases  products that compete with our products 
we have limited control  if any  as to whether these strategic partners devote adequate resources to promoting  selling and implementing our products as compared to our competitors products 
we may not be able to maintain our strategic partnerships or attract sufficient additional strategic partners who have the ability to market our products effectively  are qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service or have the technical expertise and personnel resources necessary to implement our products for our customers 
in particular  if our strategic partners do not devote sufficient resources to implement our products  we may incur substantial additional costs associated with hiring and training additional qualified technical personnel to timely implement solutions for our customers 
furthermore  our relationships with our strategic partners may not generate enough revenue to offset the significant resources used to develop these relationships 
if we are unable to leverage the strength of our strategic partnerships to generate additional revenue  our revenues and the price of our common stock could decline 
if the current improvement in the us economy does not result in increased sales of our products and services  our operating results would be harmed  and the price of our common stock could decline 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in the domestic and global economy 
we experienced the adverse effect of the economic slowdown in  and the first six months of  which resulted in a significant reduction in capital spending by our customers  as well as longer sales cycles  and the deferral or delay of purchases of our products 
in addition  the terrorist actions of september  and the recent military actions in afghanistan and iraq magnified and prolonged the adverse effects of the economic slowdown 
although the us economy improved beginning in the third quarter of  we have not experienced any resulting increase in our sales pipeline or improvement in our pipeline conversion rate 
if the current improvement in the us economy does not result in increased sales of our products and services  our results of operations could fail to meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
moreover  if the current economic conditions in europe and asia do not improve or if there is an escalation in regional or global conflicts  we may fall short of our revenue expectations for in addition  we could experience delays in the payment obligations of our reseller customers if they experience weakness in the end user market  which would increase our credit risk exposure and harm our financial condition 

table of contents as a result of our products lengthy sales cycle  our expected revenues are susceptible to fluctuations  which could cause us to fail to meet stock analysts and investors expectations  resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock 
due to the expense  broad functionality and company wide deployment of our products  our customers decision to purchase our products typically requires the approval of their executive decision makers 
in addition  we frequently must educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our products  which also can require significant time 
further  our sales cycle may lengthen as we continue to focus our sales efforts on large corporations 
as a result of these factors  the length of time from our initial contact with a customer to the customer s decision to purchase our products typically ranges from three to nine months 
we are subject to a number of significant risks as a result of our lengthy sales cycle  including our customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance review procedures  the timing of our customers budget cycles  the seasonality of technology purchases  which historically has resulted in stronger sales of our products in the fourth quarter of the year  especially when compared to lighter sales in the first quarter of the year  our customers concerns about the introduction of our products or new products from our competitors  or potential downturns in general economic or political conditions that could occur during the sales cycle 
if our sales cycle lengthens unexpectedly  it could adversely affect the timing of our revenues or increase costs  which may independently cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 
finally  if we are unsuccessful in closing sales of our products after spending significant funds and management resources  our operating margins and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
if the market in which we sell our products and services does not grow as we anticipate  we may not be able to increase our revenues at an acceptable rate of growth  and the price of our common stock could decline 
the market for software products that enable more effective business decision making by helping companies aggregate and utilize data stored throughout an organization  is relatively new and still emerging 
substantially all of our revenues are attributable to the sale of products and services in this market 
our potential customers may not fully value the benefits of using our products  not achieve favorable results using our products  experience technical difficulties in implementing our products  or use alternative methods to solve the problems addressed by our products 
if this market does not grow as we anticipate  we would not be able to sell as much of our software products and services as we currently expect  which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
we rely on the sale of a limited number of products  and if these products do not achieve broad market acceptance  our revenues would be adversely affected 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from our data integration products such as powercenter  powermart  powerconnect and related services  and to a lesser extent  our analytic application suites  data warehouse modules  business intelligence products and related services 
since we recently ceased direct sales of our analytic application suites and data warehouse modules  we expect sales of our data integration and business intelligence software and related services to comprise substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
if any of these products do not achieve market acceptance  our revenues and stock price could decrease 
in particular  with the completion of our striva acquisition  we will begin selling and 
table of contents marketing striva s technology as part of our complete product offering 
market acceptance for striva s products  as well as our current products  could be affected if  among other things  competition substantially increases in the enterprise analytic software marketplace or transactional applications suppliers integrate their products to such a degree that the utility of the data integration functionality that our products provide is minimized or rendered unnecessary 
we may not be able to successfully manage the growth of our business if we are unable to improve our internal systems  processes and controls 
we need to continue to improve our internal systems  processes and controls to effectively manage our operations and growth 
we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to these systems  processes and controls in an efficient or timely manner  and we may discover deficiencies in existing systems  processes and controls 
we have licensed technology from third parties to help us accomplish this objective 
we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems  processes and controls or in connection with third party software  which could disrupt existing customer relationships  causing us to lose customers  limit us to smaller deployments of our products or increase our technical support costs 
the loss of our key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel could adversely affect our ability to grow our company successfully 
we believe our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and key members of our management team 
we currently do not have any key man life insurance relating to our key personnel  and their employment is at will and not subject to employment contracts 
we may not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining key personnel in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to grow our company successfully 
the price of our common stock fluctuates as a result of factors other than our operating results  such as the actions of our competitors and securities analysts  as well as developments in our industry and changes in accounting rules 
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors other than our operating results  including the announcement of new products or product enhancements by our competitors  quarterly variations in our competitors results of operations  changes in earnings estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  and changes in accounting rules  such as the recording of expenses related to employee stock option grants 
after periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we and certain of our officers and directors have been named as defendants in a purported class action complaint  which was filed on behalf of certain persons who purchased our common stock between april  and december  such actions could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
if our products are unable to interoperate with hardware and software technologies that are developed and maintained by third parties that are not within our control  our ability to develop and sell our products to our customers could be adversely affected which would result in harm to our business and operating results 
our products are designed to interoperate with and provide access to a wide range of third party developed and maintained hardware and software technologies  which are used by our customers 
the future design and development plans of the third parties that maintain these technologies are not within our control and may not be in line with our future product development plans 
we may also rely on such third parties to 
table of contents provide us with access to these technologies so that we can properly test and develop our products to interoperate with the third party technologies 
these third parties may in the future refuse or otherwise be unable to provide us with the necessary access to their technologies 
in addition  these third parties may decide to design or develop their technologies in a manner that would not be interoperable with our own 
if either of these risks occur  we would not be able to continue to market our products as interoperable with such third party hardware and software  which could adversely affect our ability to successfully sell our products to our customers 
we rely on a number of different distribution channels to sell and market our products 
any conflicts that we may experience within these various distribution channels could result in confusion for our customers and a decrease in revenue and operating margins 
we have a number of relationships with resellers  systems integrators and distributors which assist us in obtaining broad market coverage for our products and services 
although our discount policies  sales commission structure and reseller licensing programs are intended to support each distribution channel with a minimum level of channel conflicts  we may not be able to minimize these channel conflicts in the future 
any channel conflicts that we may experience could result in confusion for our customers and a decrease in revenue and operating margins 
any significant defect in our products could cause us to lose revenue and expose us to product liability claims 
the software products we offer are inherently complex and despite extensive testing and quality control  have in the past and may in the future contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced 
these defects and errors could cause damage to our reputation  loss of revenue  product returns  order cancellations or lack of market acceptance of our products 
we have in the past and may in the future need to issue corrective releases of our software products to fix these defects or errors 
for example  we issued corrective releases to fix problems with the version of our powermart released in the first quarter of as a result  we had to allocate significant customer support resources to address these problems 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future national  federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims  which could be substantial in light of the use of our products in enterprise wide environments 
in addition  our insurance against product liability may not be adequate to cover a potential claim 
if we are unable to successfully respond to technological advances and evolving industry standards  we could experience a reduction in our future product sales  which would cause our revenues to decline 
the market for our products is characterized by continuing technological development  evolving industry standards  changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the introduction of products by our direct competitors or others embodying new technologies  the emergence of new industry standards or changes in customer requirements could render our existing products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
in particular  an industry wide adoption of uniform open standards across heterogeneous applications could minimize the importance of the integration functionality of our products and materially adversely affect the competitiveness and market acceptance of our products 
our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products  to respond to changing customer requirements and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological and competitive developments and emerging industry standards 
we have in the past experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future 
as a result  in the past  some of our customers deferred purchasing our products until the next upgrade was released 
future delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases may cause customers to forego purchases of 
table of contents our products and purchase those of our competitors instead 
additionally  even if we are able to develop new products and product enhancements  we cannot assure you that they will achieve market acceptance 
we recognize revenue from specific customers at the time we receive payment for our products  and if these customers do not make timely payment  our revenues could decrease 
based on limited credit history  we recognize revenue from direct end users  resellers  distributors and oems  which have not been deemed credit worthy  at the time we receive payment for our products  rather than at the time of sale 
if these customers do not make timely payment for our products  our revenues could decrease 
if our revenues decrease  the price of our common stock may fall 
we have a limited operating history and a cumulative net loss  which makes it difficult to evaluate our operations  products and prospects for the future 
we were incorporated in and began selling our products in  therefore  we have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our operations  products and prospects 
with the exception of where we had net income of million  since our inception we have incurred significant net losses  including losses of million and million the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain profitability in the future 
if we are unable to sustain profitability  we may fail to meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors  and the price of our common stock may fall 
our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property  collections  exchange rate fluctuations  regulatory and other risks  which could limit our future growth 
we have significant operations outside the united states  including software development centers in india  the netherlands and the united kingdom  sales offices in belgium  canada  france  germany  the netherlands  switzerland and the united kingdom  and customer support centers in the netherlands and the united kingdom 
our international operations face numerous risks 
for example  in order to sell our products in certain foreign countries  our products must be localized  that is  customized to meet local user needs 
developing local versions of our products for foreign markets is difficult  requires us to incur additional expenses and can take longer than we anticipate 
we currently have limited experience in localizing products and in testing whether these localized products will be accepted in the targeted countries 
we cannot assure you that our localization efforts will be successful 
in addition  we have only a limited history of marketing  selling and supporting our products and services internationally 
as a result  we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations 
however  we may experience difficulties in recruiting  training and managing an international staff 
we must also be able to enter into strategic distributor relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence 
if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships  our future success in these international markets could be limited 
our software development centers in india  the netherlands and the united kingdom also subject our business to certain risks  including greater difficulty in protecting our ownership rights to intellectual property developed in foreign countries  which may have laws that materially differ from those in the united states  communication delays between our main development center in redwood shores  california and our development centers in india  the netherlands and the united kingdom as a result of time zone differences  which may delay the development  testing or release of new products  
table of contents greater difficulty in relocating existing trained development personnel and recruiting local experienced personnel  and the costs and expenses associated with such activities  and increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for the development centers 
additionally  our international operations as a whole are subject to a number of risks  including the following greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles  greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices  tariffs  and tax laws and treaties  fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business because we do not engage in any hedging activities  and general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 
these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and  consequently  materially impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our failure to manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights  third parties could develop and market products that are equivalent to our own  which would harm our sales efforts 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we believe that our product developments  product enhancements  name recognition and the technological and innovative skills of our personnel are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
however  these legal rights and contractual agreements may provide only limited protection 
our pending patent applications may not be allowed or our competitors may successfully challenge the validity or scope of any of our six issued patents or any future issued patents 
our patents alone may not provide us with any significant competitive advantage  and third parties may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around our patents 
third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
we cannot easily monitor any unauthorized use of our products  and  although we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy is a prevalent problem in our industry in general 
the risk of not adequately protecting our proprietary technology and our exposure to competitive pressures may be increased if a competitor should resort to unlawful means in competing against us 
we recently filed a complaint against ascential software corporation in which we asserted that ascential  and a number of former informatica employees recruited and hired by ascential  misappropriated our trade secrets  including sensitive products and marketing information and detailed sales information regarding existing and potential customers and unlawfully used that information to benefit ascential in gaining a competitive advantage against us 
in july  we settled this lawsuit with ascential 
the settlement includes a consent judgment being entered against ascential  and a permanent injunction enjoining ascential from using  or further disseminating  confidential  sensitive informatica information and materials 
ascential also agreed to pay informatica a sum of million 
the settlement is included in other income 
we have entered into agreements with many of our customers and partners that require us to place the source code of our products into escrow 
such agreements generally provide that such parties will have a limited  non exclusive right to use such code if there is a bankruptcy proceeding by or against us  we cease to do business  or we fail to meet our support obligations 
although our agreements with these third 
table of contents parties limit the scope of rights to use of the source code  we may be unable to effectively control such third party s actions 
furthermore  effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in various foreign countries 
the protection of our proprietary rights may be inadequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
we may be forced to initiate litigation in order to protect our proprietary rights 
for example  on july   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against acta technology  inc although this lawsuit is in the early stages  litigating claims related to the enforcement of proprietary rights can be very expensive and can be burdensome in terms of management time and resources  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
as is common in the software industry  we have received and may continue from time to time to receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent and other proprietary rights 
third parties could claim that our current or future products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights 
as the number of software products in our target markets increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we may become increasingly subject to claims by a third party that our technology infringes such party s proprietary rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
although we do not believe that we are currently infringing any proprietary rights of others  legal action claiming patent infringement could be commenced against us  and we may not prevail in such litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in patent litigation 
the potential effects on our business that may result from a third party infringement claim include the following we may be forced to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  we may be required to indemnify our customers or obtain replacement products or functionality for our customers  we may be forced to significantly increase our development efforts and resources to redesign our products as a result of these claims  and we may be forced to discontinue the sale of some or all of our products 
we may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute our existing stockholders  or cause us to incur contingent liabilities  debt or significant expense 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of  or investments in  related businesses  products or technologies 
for example  we recently acquired striva in september  and we invested  in a private company that is still in the development stage of its business cycle 
future acquisitions and investments like these could result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities  the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities  or the payment of cash to purchase equity securities from third parties 
there can be no assurance that any strategic acquisition or investment  including striva  will succeed 

table of contents delaware law  as well as our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  contains provisions that could deter potential acquisition bids  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  discourage merger offers and prevent changes in our management or board of directors 
our basic corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of informatica or a change in our management 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under the plan  we issued a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of november   and such rights will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events 
because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock without first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition 
our bylaws provide that we have a classified board of directors  with each class of directors subject to re election every three years 
this classified board has the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to insert their representatives on our board of directors and gain control of informatica 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
the existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  which may not be available on reasonable terms to us  if at all 
we may not generate sufficient revenue from operations to offset our operating or other expenses 
as a result  in the future  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
we may not be able to borrow money or sell more of our equity securities to meet our cash needs 
even if we are able to do so  it may not be on terms that are favorable or reasonable to us 
if we are not able to raise additional capital when we need it in the future  our business could be seriously harmed 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
our facilities in the state of california are currently subject to electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power  which occurred during in the event these blackouts are reinstated  they could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities 
in connection with the shortage of available power  prices for electricity may continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
such price changes will increase our operating costs  which could negatively impact our profitability 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in risk factors 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist primarily of commercial 
table of contents paper  us government notes and bonds  corporate bonds and municipal securities 
all investments are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
as of december   the average rate of return on our investments was 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by less than million 
declines in interest rates will  over time  reduce our interest income 
foreign currency risk we market and sell our software and services through our direct sales force and indirect channel partners in the united states as well as belgium  canada  france  germany  the netherlands  switzerland and the united kingdom 
we also have relationships with indirect channel partners in various other regions  including asia pacific  australia  europe  japan and latin america 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as our sales are primarily in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes and currency fluctuations may have a quarterly impact on our financial results 
to date  we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities
