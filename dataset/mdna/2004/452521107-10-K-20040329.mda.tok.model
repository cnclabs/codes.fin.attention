item business overview we are a leading provider of haptic technology that brings the sense of feel or touch to a wide variety of markets 
we develop  manufacture  license and support a wide range of hardware and software technologies that let users interact with digital devices using their sense of touch 
we focus on four application areas consumer  computing and entertainment  industrial and automotive  three dimensional and professional products  and medical simulation 
we manage these application areas under two operating and reportable segments immersion computing  entertainment and industrial  and immersion medical 
in markets where our touch technology is a small piece of a larger system such as cellular phones  consumer gaming peripherals and automotive interfaces  we license our technologies to third party manufacturers who integrate our technology into their products and resell it under their own brand names 
in other markets  where our touch technology is a complete system like medical simulation systems and three dimensional and professional products  we manufacture and sell products under our own immersion brand name  through direct sales  distributors and value added resellers 
in all market areas  we also engage in development projects for third parties and government agencies from time to time 
our objective is to proliferate our touchsense technologies across markets  platforms and applications so that touch and feel become as common as color  graphics and sound in modern user interfaces 
immersion and its wholly owned subsidiaries hold more than issued patents and more than pending patent applications worldwide  covering various aspects of hardware and software technologies 
haptics the science of touch simulation haptics refers to the sense of touch 
although the word haptics may be new to many people  everyone uses their sense of touch when interacting with their immediate environment 
haptic feedback is part of any motor action  for example  typing on a keyboard  using a mouse  biting an apple  sculpting  writing and giving a hug 
the haptic sensory system has two components tactile sensing and kinesthetic sensing 
tactile sensing refers to an awareness of the stimulation of the skin 
kinesthetic sensing refers to an awareness of body parts and their position and movement with eyes closed  we know the positions of our limbs  as well as muscle tension 
unlike vision and hearing that are mainly input systems for the human observer  the haptic system is bi directional 
you use your sense of touch to both feel take in information and manipulate have an effect on something 
many activities including reading braille and playing the piano provide haptic feedback during motor task 

table of contents in the world of computers  haptic feedback  also known as force feedback  refers to the physical forces created by input output devices to stimulate the sense of touch 
these forces are made by actuators  usually motors  which in their simplest form are built into peripheral devices such as joysticks  steering wheels and gamepads 
they can also be designed into more sophisticated interfaces designed for industrial  medical  automotive or scientific applications 
under digital control  touch enabled peripheral devices can impart to users physical sensations like rough textures  smooth surfaces  viscous liquids  compliant springs  jarring vibrations  heavy masses and rumbling engines 
as a user uses a touch enabled device  such as a joystick  motors within the device apply computer modulated forces that resist  assist and enhance the manipulations 
these forces are generated based on mathematical models that simulate the desired sensations 
for example  when simulating the feel of a rigid wall with a force feedback joystick  motors within the joystick apply forces that simulate the feel of encountering the wall 
as the user moves the joystick to penetrate the wall  the motors apply a force that resists the penetration 
the harder the user pushes  the harder the motors push back 
the end result is a sensation that feels like a physical encounter with an obstacle 
the mathematical models that control the motors may be simple modulating forces based on a function of time  such as jolts and vibrations  or may be more complex forces such as surfaces  textures  springs and liquids 
complex sensations can be created by combining a number of simpler sensations 
for example  a series of simulated surfaces can be combined to give the seamless feel of a complex object like a sports car 
textures can be added to these complex surfaces so that the windshield of the sports car feels smooth and its tires feel rubbery 
industry background historically  haptic systems were first used in applications like military flight simulators 
as early as in the s  combat pilots honed their flight skills in training simulators that replicated the feel of flying actual planes 
motors and actuators pushed  pulled  and shook the flight yoke  throttle  rudder pedals  and cockpit shell  reproducing many of the tactile and kinesthetic cues of real flight 
though advanced for their time  these systems were limited by the then available technology and were therefore relatively crude and low fidelity by today s standards 
they also cost at least hundreds of thousands  if not millions  of dollars and therefore were not within the grasp of consumers or even most businesses 
by the late s and early s  computing power reached the point where rich color graphics and high quality audio were possible 
computers evolved from primitive command prompt  text based systems on monochrome display monitors to powerful systems capable of rendering colorful pictures  charts  and animations and playing music and sound effects 
these advancements in turn bred entirely new businesses in the late s and early s 
to the consumer  the multimedia revolution changed things  like flight simulation from a professional pilot only activity to a pc based hobby for millions of private pilots and aspiring pilots 
the graphics and sound these hobbyists gamers experienced at home was far superior to what the combat pilots experienced in the s 
the multimedia revolution also made the medical simulation business possible 
by the s  high end silicon graphics workstations enabled parts of the human anatomy to be displayed with never before possible realism 
companies were founded to harness this new technology and turn it into safer and more effective teaching aids for medical personnel 
the interactive nature of a multimedia computer workstation based medical curriculum was far superior to traditional medical textbooks and without the shortcomings and or excessive cost of animals  cadavers  and live patients 
however  the multimedia revolution also highlighted a shortcoming in the products of the medical simulation market even though the graphics and animations looked incredibly realistic  graphics and sound could not possibly convey to a physician what it actually feels like to break through a venal wall with a catheter needle or what it feels like to cut through the tissue surrounding a gall bladder with a scalpel 
in the case of flight simulation  graphics and sound could not possibly convey to a hobbyist what it actually feels like to fight the flight yoke or flight stick out of a steep dive or through a sharply banked turn 
only hands on experience provided this critical component of learning 

table of contents so by the mid s  these new industrial and consumer multimedia products were in need of haptic technology that could provide that missing hands on experience  bringing the critical sense of touch back into the experience 
immersion was founded in to provide just that 
by combining the basic concepts that were used in the military flight simulators of the s  state of the art advancements in robotic controls  advancements in the understanding of how the human sense of touch works  and advancements in computing power  immersion was able to significantly reduce the cost and size of haptic solutions while simultaneously increasing the quality of the simulated sensations 
immersion s early products were used in the world s first consumer force feedback peripherals for video computer games as flight sticks and steering wheels 
these products not only looked and sounded like the real thing  but also felt like the real thing 
and for the first time  sophisticated medical simulators offered medical professionals the ability to train  practice and enhance their surgical and other procedural skills in a way never before possible 
continued advancements in size  power and cost reductions have pushed the adoption of haptics even further into those industries as well as into new ones 
immersion s touchsense technology is now widespread in gamepads  joysticks  and steering wheels for sony s playstation  microsoft s xbox  nintendo s gamecube  and the pc and apple macintosh 
hundreds of immersion medical simulators have been deployed at hospitals and medical schools throughout the united states and abroad 
immersion s haptic technology is also now used by designers from boeing  gm  and toyota and by researchers from nasa  stanford  and mit 
and automobiles from bmw  rolls royce  and volkswagen now use programmable haptic controls powered by immersion technology 
today  computing power continues to march forward and push multimedia capabilities into new areas like cell phones and industrial controls  thereby creating even more exciting opportunities for immersion s haptic technology 
our solution our goal is to change the way people interact with digital devices by adding the sense of touch to a digital world 
our touch technologies give users a more complete  intuitive experience

our hardware and software technologies work together to enable devices to present touch sensations 
our patented designs include specialized hardware elements such as motors  control electronics and mechanisms  which are incorporated into common computer peripheral devices  such as gamepads and joysticks  or more complex devices  such as endoscopic surgical simulators 
driven by software algorithms  these hardware elements direct tactile sensations corresponding to on screen events to the user s hand 
when designed into our licensees products our haptic technologies enable enhanced simulation and training applications 
some computer applications  such as those that simulate product prototypes must be realistic to be effective 
to save time and expense in product design  immersion customers use our d whole hand sensing glove technologies  which  together with our software products  allow for real time  three dimensional object manipulation 
for medical procedures  the medical community has started to enhance traditional medical training and education with simulation systems to improve skills and educate health professionals worldwide 
our medical simulation systems provide tactile feedback that simulates what a doctor would feel when performing an actual procedure 
these include systems teaching laparoscopic  endovascular and endoscopic surgeries and catheter insertion 
presenting information through the sense of touch 
it is difficult to communicate physical properties such as texture  compliance  weight and friction through only words  pictures or sound 
our technologies allow people to use their sense of touch to perceive these physical properties in a way that is instantly understandable and intuitively accessible 
our technologies significantly improve the ability of software to communicate to users the physical features of a product  the physical properties of a medical procedure and the physical response of an object in a simulated gaming environment

several companies also currently market force feedback products to nonconsumer markets and could shift their focus to the consumer market 
in addition  our licensees may develop products that compete with products employing our touch enabling technology but are based on alternative technologies or develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies  duplicate our technologies or design around our patents 
many of our licensees  including microsoft  logitech  and other potential competitors have greater financial and technical resources upon which to draw in attempting to develop computer peripheral technologies that do not make use of our touch enabling technology 
our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property rights for any reason could hurt our competitive position 
there is no guarantee that patents will be issued from the patent applications that we have filed or may file 
our issued patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and claims of our patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength or issued in the proper geographic regions  to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
our competitive position is partially dependent on the competitive positions of our licensees that pay a per unit royalty 
our licensees markets are highly competitive 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our licensees markets include price  performance  user centric design  ease of use  quality and timeliness of products  as well as the manufacturer s responsiveness  capacity  technical abilities  established customer 
table of contents relationships  retail shelf space  advertising  promotional programs and brand recognition 
touch related benefits in such markets may be viewed simply as enhancements and compete with non touch enabled technologies 
there are several companies that currently sell high end simulation products that compete with our immersion medical division s products  including simbionix  mentice and medical simulation corporation 
the principal bases for competition in these markets are technological sophistication and price 
we believe we compete favorably on these bases 
another company  sensable technologies  currently sells high end d sculpting and design products that employ haptics 
we believe that sensable s products compete on some level with our d interaction products 
intellectual property we believe that intellectual property protection is crucial to our business 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property 
immersion and its wholly owned subsidiaries hold more than issued patents and more than pending patent applications in the us and abroad covering various aspects of our hardware and software technologies 
our current us patents begin to expire starting in where we feel it is appropriate  we will engage the legal system to protect our intellectual property rights as we have done in our complaint against sony computer entertainment 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation 
we anticipate that this litigation will continue to be costly  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the costs we incur in connection with the litigation

factors that may affect future results we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december   have a history of losses  will experience losses in the future and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
since  we have incurred losses in every fiscal quarter 
we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we protect and enforce our intellectual property  including the costs of our litigation against sony computer entertainment  continue to develop our technologies  attempt to expand the market for touch enabled products  increase our sales efforts  and pursue strategic relationships 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations  we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
our current litigation against sony computer entertainment is expensive  disruptive and time consuming and will continue to be  and regardless of whether we are ultimately successful  could adversely affect our business 
on february   we filed a complaint against microsoft corporation  sony computer entertainment  inc  and sony computer entertainment of america  inc in the us district court for the northern district court of california alleging infringement of us patent nos 
 and  the case was assigned to united states district judge claudia wilken 
on april   sony computer entertainment and microsoft answered the complaint by denying the material allegations and alleging counterclaims seeking a judicial declaration that the asserted patents were invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
under the counterclaims  the defendants are also seeking damages for attorneys fees 
the process of discovery and exchanging information and documents on infringement  invalidity  and damages  is ongoing 
on october   we filed an amended complaint  withdrawing the claim under the patent and adding claims under a new patent  us patent no 
 on october   the court entered an amended case management order that set  among other dates in the case  april  for a hearing to construe the claims of the asserted patents and april  for the start of trial 
on october   sony computer entertainment and microsoft answered the amended complaint and alleged similar counterclaims for declaratory relief that the asserted patents are invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
on march   sony computer entertainment filed a motion for summary judgment of non infringement 
at immersion s request  the court ordered this motion stricken  without prejudice to its being refiled at a later date after the court rules on claim construction 
on april   the court held the scheduled claim construction hearing 
on july   the court issued an order modifying case management order that reset certain scheduled dates in the case  including setting april  as the start of trial 
on october   
table of contents the court issued its claim construction order construing certain terms of the patents asserted in the lawsuit 
on january   sony computer entertainment moved for summary judgment on the grounds that all asserted claims are invalid 
immersion has opposed these motions 
on february   the court held a hearing on these motions 
on march   the court issued a written ruling on the summary judgment motions 
the court denied sony s motion for summary judgment of invalidity 
the court granted all but one of immersion s motions and dismissed several sony defenses 
on march  the court rescheduled the trial from april  to april  on july   we announced that we had settled our legal differences with microsoft and we and microsoft agreed to dismiss all claims and counterclaims relating to this matter as well as assume financial responsibility for our respective legal costs with respect to the lawsuit between immersion and microsoft 
we continue to pursue our claims of infringement against sony computer entertainment 
in the event we settle our lawsuit with sony computer entertainment  we will be obligated to pay certain sums to microsoft as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
if sony computer entertainment were successful in its counterclaims and our patents were deemed invalid and unenforceable  the assets relating to the patents that were deemed invalid would be impaired and we may be required to pay sony computer entertainment s attorneys fees 
the case is scheduled to go to trial in april due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation 
we anticipate that the litigation will continue to be costly  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the costs we incur in connection with the litigation 
we expense litigation costs as incurred and only accrue for costs that have been incurred but not paid to the vendor as of the financial statement date 
the litigation has diverted  and is likely to continue to divert  the efforts and attention of some of our key management and personnel 
as a result  until such time as it is resolved  the litigation could adversely affect our business 
further  any unfavorable outcome could adversely affect our business 
the market for touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products is at an early stage and if market demand does not develop  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
the market for our touch enabling technologies  and our licensees touch enabled products is at an early stage 
if we and our licensees are unable to develop demand for touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
we cannot accurately predict the growth of the markets for these technologies and products  the timing of product introductions or the timing of commercial acceptance of these products 
even if our touch enabling technologies and our licensees touch enabled products are ultimately widely adopted  widespread adoption may take a long time to occur 
the timing and amount of royalties and product sales that we receive will depend on whether the products marketed achieve widespread adoption and  if so  how rapidly that adoption occurs 
we expect that we will need to pursue extensive and expensive marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective licensees and end users about the uses and benefits of our technologies and to persuade software developers to create software that utilizes our technologies 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are volatile  and if our future results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
these factors include the establishment or loss of licensing relationships  the timing of payments under fixed and or up front license agreements  the timing of our expenses  including costs related to litigation  acquisitions of technologies or businesses  
table of contents the timing of introductions of new products and product enhancements by us  our licensees or their competitors  our ability to develop and improve our technologies  our ability to attract  integrate and retain qualified personnel  and seasonality in the demand for our licensees products 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
in addition  because a high percentage of our operating expenses are fixed  a shortfall of revenues can cause significant variations in operating results from period to period 
if we are unable to enter into new licensing arrangements with our existing licensees and with additional third party manufacturers for our touch enabling technology  our royalty revenue may not grow 
our revenue growth is significantly dependent on our ability to enter into new licensing arrangements 
our failure to enter into new licensing arrangements will cause our operating results to suffer 
we face numerous risks in obtaining new licenses on terms consistent with our business objectives and in maintaining  expanding and supporting our relationships with our current licensees 
these risks include the lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with potential licensees  the fact that we may compete with the internal design teams of existing and potential licensees  difficulties in persuading consumer product manufacturers to work with us  to rely on us for critical technology and to disclose to us proprietary product development and other strategies  if we are not successful in the litigation with sony  not only might we have a difficult time signing up new gaming licensees  we also risk losing our existing licensees as well  difficulties in convincing car companies to sign a license agreement with us when they will need to purchase components from one of their vendors who may or may not yet be able to meet the car companies stringent quality and parts availability standards  difficulties in persuading existing and potential licensees to bear the development costs necessary to incorporate our technologies into their products  and challenges in demonstrating the compelling value of our technologies in new applications like cell phones and automobiles 
a majority of our current royalty revenue has been derived from the licensing of our portfolio of touch enabling technologies for personal computer gaming peripherals  such as joysticks and steering wheels 
the market for joysticks and steering wheels for use with personal computers is declining and is a substantially smaller market than either the dedicated gaming console market and is characterized by declining average selling prices 
if we are unable to gain market acceptance beyond the personal computer gaming peripherals market  we may not achieve royalty revenue growth 
the terms in our agreements may be construed by our licensees in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights that we have granted to other licensees  or in a manner that may require us to incur substantial costs to resolve conflicts over license terms 
we have entered into  and will continue to enter into  agreements pursuant to which our licensees are granted rights under our technology and intellectual property 
these rights may be granted in certain fields of use  or with respect to certain market sectors or product categories  and may include exclusive rights or sublicensing rights 
the license terms and restrictions in our agreements  including but not limited to field of use definitions  market sector and product category definitions  and sublicensing and exclusivity terms  shall collectively be referred to as license provisions 

table of contents due to the continuing evolution of market sectors  product categories and licensee business models  and to the compromises inherent in the drafting and negotiation of license provisions  our licensees may  at some time during the term of their agreements with us  interpret license provisions in their agreements in a way that is different to our interpretation of such license provisions  or in a way that is in conflict with the rights that we have granted to other licensees 
such interpretations by our licensees may lead to a claims that we have granted rights to one licensee which are inconsistent with the rights that we have granted to another licensee  and or b claims by one licensee against another licensee that may result in our incurring indemnification or other obligations or liabilities 
in addition  after entering into an agreement it is possible that markets and or products  or legal and or regulatory environments  will evolve in a manner that was not foreseen or was not foreseeable at the time the agreement was entered into 
as a consequence  in the agreement we may have granted rights that will preclude or restrict our exploitation of potentially lucrative new opportunities that arise after the execution of the agreement 
automotive royalties could be reduced if bmw were to abandon its idrive system 
our largest royalty stream from the auto industry is from bmw for its idrive controller 
press reviews of this system have been largely negative and critical of the system s complexity 
while this negative press is not our fault  it may mean limited sales of bmw s cars  and could ultimately lead to their abandoning the system  which could reduce or eliminate the related royalties 
because we have a fixed payment license with microsoft  our royalty revenue from licensing in the gaming market and other consumer markets might decline if microsoft increases its volume of sales of touch enabled gaming products and consumer products at the expense of our other licensees 
under the terms of our present agreement with microsoft  microsoft receives a royalty free  perpetual  irrevocable license to immersion s worldwide portfolio of patents 
this license permits microsoft to make  use and sell hardware  software and services  excluding specified products  covered by immersion s patents 
immersion also granted to microsoft a limited right  under immersion s patents relating to touch technology  to sublicense specified rights  excluding rights to excluded products and peripheral devices  to third party customers of microsoft s or microsoft s subsidiaries operating systems other than sony corporation  sony computer entertainment  inc  sony computer entertainment of america  inc  and their subsidiaries 
in exchange  for the grant of these rights and the rights included in a separate sublicense agreement  microsoft paid immersion a one time payment of million 
we will not receive any further revenues or royalties from microsoft under our current agreement with microsoft 
microsoft has a significant share of the market for touch enabled gaming computer peripherals and is pursuing other consumer markets such as cell phones and pdas 
microsoft has significantly greater financial  sales and marketing resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than our other licensees 
in the event that microsoft increases its share of these markets  our royalty revenue from other licensees in these market segments might decline 
our relationship with medtronic  a leading medical device company  may interfere with our ability to enter into development and licensing relationships with medtronic s competitors 
in february  we entered into an agreement with medtronic  a leading medical device company  in which medtronic was granted a right of first negotiation 
the right of first negotiation applies to any agreement  which we refer to as a proposed agreement  under which we would grant a third party rights to use specified immersion intellectual property in specified fields of use 
under the terms of the right of first negotiation  we must notify medtronic if we have received a written offer from a third party to enter into a proposed agreement  or if we are seeking to find a third party to enter into a proposed agreement 
medtronic has the exclusive right  for a period of forty days  to negotiate with us regarding the material terms of the proposed agreement 
if during such forty day period  medtronic and immersion fail to reach agreement in principle upon the material terms of the proposed agreement  then we will have twelve months after the expiration of such forty day period to enter into an agreement with the applicable third party  provided that the terms of such agreement are in the aggregate more favorable to immersion than the offer presented by medtronic or the terms under which we initially sought to find a third party to enter into the proposed agreement 
the right of first negotiation ceases to apply to any 
table of contents proposed agreement for which medtronic and immersion reach agreement in principle upon the material terms during the applicable forty day period  but thereafter do not execute a definitive agreement within days after the expiration of such forty day period 
in addition  medtronic s right of first negotiation terminates upon the second anniversary of the completion of a development project to be undertaken by us for medtronic 
although the right of first negotiation has not impeded our ability to interest other medical device companies in our technologies to date  this right of first negotiation or our relationship with medtronic may impede  restrict or delay our ability to enter into development or license agreements with large medical device companies that compete with medtronic 
any restriction in our ability to enter into development or license agreements with other medical device companies would adversely affect our revenues 
medtronic accounts for a large portion of our revenues and a reduction in sales to medtronic  a reduction in development work  or a decision not to renew existing licenses by medtronic may reduce our total revenue 
for the years ended december   and we derived  and  respectively  of our total revenue from medtronic 
if our royalty and license revenue or product sales to medtronic decline  and or medtronic reduces the development activities we perform  then our total revenue may decline 
in addition  under our recent agreements with medtronic  monies advanced by medtronic are subject to refund provisions under certain circumstances 
these circumstances have not arisen to date  but we cannot predict whether these circumstances will arise in the future 
mad catz accounts for a significant portion of our revenue and the failure of mad catz to achieve sales volumes for its gaming products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies may reduce our total revenue 
mad catz accounts for a significant portion of our total revenue 
for the year ended december  our revenue from mad catz increased as compared to for the years ended december   and we derived  and  respectively of our total revenue from mad catz 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenue will continue to be derived from mad catz 
if mad catz fails to achieve anticipated sales volumes for its computer peripheral products that incorporate our technologies  our total revenue may decline 
logitech accounts for a significant portion of our revenue and the failure of logitech to achieve sales volumes for its gaming peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies may reduce our total revenue 
logitech has in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue 
for the year ended december  our revenue from logitech declined from for the years ended december   and we derived from logitech  and  respectively of our total revenue 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenue will continue to be derived from logitech 
if logitech fails to achieve anticipated sales volumes for its computer peripheral products that incorporate our technologies  our total revenue may decline 
we may elect to or need to raise additional capital in the future  which may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
should any unanticipated circumstances arise which significantly increase our cash or capital requirements we may elect to or need to raise additional capital in order to ensure a sufficient supply of cash for such events or future periods 
our plans to raise additional capital may include possible customer prepayments of certain royalty obligations in exchange for a royalty discount and or other negotiated concessions  entering into new license agreements that require up front license payments  and through debt or equity financing 
we have taken measures to control our costs and will continue to monitor these efforts 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
changes in equity markets over the past three years have adversely affected the ability of companies to raise equity financing and have adversely affected the markets for financing for companies with a history of losses such as ours 
additional financing may require us to issue additional shares of our common or preferred stock such that our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution 

table of contents we may be unable to increase sales of our medical simulation devices if  as a result of the current economic slowdown or other factors  medical institutions do not budget for such devices 
our medical simulation products  such as our accutouch endoscopy simulator  the accutouch endovascular simulator and our laparoscopic surgical workstation tm  have only recently begun to be used by hospitals and medical schools to train healthcare professionals 
as a result  many of these medical institutions do not budget for such simulation devices 
to increase sales of our simulation devices  we must  in addition to convincing medical institution personnel of the utility of the devices  persuade them to include a significant expenditure for the devices in their budgets 
if these medical institutions are unwilling to budget for simulation devices or reduce their budgets as a result of the economic slowdown  cost containment pressures or other factors  we may not be able to increase sales of medical simulators at a satisfactory rate 
as a result of the terrorist attacks against the united states on september  and the continuing threat of terrorist acts  hospitals may have assigned priority in their capital expenditure budgets to equipment that will enable them to respond more effectively to catastrophic emergencies  and federal  state and local governments may have delayed certain funding for medical and educational institutions  in which case purchases of medical simulators may have been deferred 
if we are unable to increase sales of our medical simulation products  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we believe that medical device companies may also decrease their expenditures in corporate research and development budgets and this may adversely affect our contract and development revenue generated by the medical segment 
we do not control or influence our licensees manufacturing  promotion  distribution or pricing of their products incorporating our touch enabling technologies  upon which we are dependent to generate royalty revenue 
a key part of our business strategy is to license our intellectual property to companies that manufacture and sell products incorporating our touch enabling technologies 
sales of those products generate royalty and license revenue for us 
for the years ended december   and   and of our total revenues were royalty and license revenues 
however  we do not control or influence the manufacture  quality control  promotion  distribution or pricing of products that are manufactured and sold by our licensees 
in addition  we generally do not have commitments from our licensees that they will continue to use our technology in future products 
as a result  products incorporating our technologies may not be brought to market  meet quality control standards  achieve commercial acceptance or generate meaningful royalty revenue for us 
for us to generate royalty revenue  licensees that pay us per unit royalties must manufacture and distribute products incorporating our touch enabling technologies in a timely fashion and generate consumer demand through marketing and other promotional activities 
products incorporating our touch enabling technologies are generally difficult to design and manufacture which may cause product introduction delays or quality control problems 
if our licensees fail to stimulate and capitalize upon market demand for products that generate royalties for us  or if products are recalled because of quality control problems  our revenues will not grow and could decline 
peak demand for products that incorporate our technologies  especially in the computer gaming peripherals market  typically occurs in the third and fourth calendar quarters as a result of increased demand during the year end holiday season 
if our licensees do not ship products incorporating our touch enabling technology in a timely fashion or fail to achieve strong sales in the fourth quarter of the calendar year  we may not receive related royalty and license revenue 
reduced spending by corporate research and development departments may adversely affect sales of our three dimensional and professional products 
we believe that the current economic downturn has led to a reduction in corporations budgets for research and development in several sectors  including the automotive and aerospace sectors  which use our three dimensional and professional products 
sales of our three dimensional and professional products  including our cyberglove line of whole hand sensing gloves and our microscribe g line of three dimensional digitizers may be adversely affected by these cuts in corporate research and development budgets 

table of contents we have limited distribution channels and resources to market and sell our medical simulation and three dimensional simulation products  and if we are unsuccessful in marketing and selling these products we may not achieve or sustain product revenue growth 
we have limited resources for marketing and selling medical simulation or three dimensional simulation products either directly or through distributors 
to achieve our business objectives we must build a balanced mixture of sales through a direct sales channel and through qualified distribution channels 
the success of our efforts to sell medical simulation and three dimensional simulation products will depend upon our ability to retain and develop a qualified sales force and effective distributor channels 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel necessary to sell and market our simulation products 
a number of our distributors represent small specialized companies that may not have sufficient capital or human resources to support the complexities of selling and supporting simulation products 
there is no assurance that our direct selling efforts will be effective  distributors will market our products successfully or  if our relationships with distributors terminate  we will be able to establish relationships with other distributors on satisfactory terms  if at all 
any disruption in the distribution  sales or marketing network for our simulation products could have a material adverse effect on our product revenues 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights could be expensive  disruptive  and time consuming  could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property  and could adversely affect our business 
intellectual property litigation  whether brought by us or by others against us  could result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management s time and efforts 
from time to time  we initiate claims against third parties that we believe infringe our intellectual property rights 
we intend to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously and may initiate litigation against parties that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation 
litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly  time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property 
in addition  any litigation in which we are accused of infringement may cause product shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technology or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements even before the issue of infringement has been decided on the merits 
if any litigation were not resolved in our favor  we could become subject to substantial damage claims from third parties and indemnification claims from our licensees 
we and our licensees could be enjoined from the continued use of the technology at issue without a royalty or license agreement 
royalty or license agreements  if required  might not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if a third party claiming infringement against us prevailed and we could not develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost effective basis  our expenses would increase and our revenues could decrease 
we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may hold  or may in the future be issued  patents that could be infringed by our products or technologies 
any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us with respect to the products that we manufacture and the technologies that we license 
from time to time  we have received letters from companies  several of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do  asserting that some of our technologies  or those of our licensees  infringe their intellectual property rights 
certain of our licensees have received similar letters from these or other companies 
such letters may influence our licensees decisions whether to ship products incorporating our technologies 
although none of these matters has resulted in litigation to date  any of these notices  or additional notices that we could receive in the future from these or other companies  could lead to litigation 
we have acquired patents from third parties and also license some technologies from third parties 
we must rely upon the owners of the patents or the technologies for information on the origin and ownership of the acquired or licensed technologies 
as a result  our exposure to infringement claims may increase 
we generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of acquired or licensed technology and indemnification to cover any breach of these representations 
however  representations may not be accurate and indemnification may not provide adequate compensation for breach of the representations 
intellectual property claims against our 
table of contents licensees  or us whether or not they have merit  could be time consuming to defend  cause product shipment delays  require us to pay damages  harm existing license arrangements  or require us or our licensees to cease utilizing the technology unless we can enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
furthermore  claims could also result in claims from our licensees under the indemnification provisions of their agreements with us 
if we fail to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  our ability to license our technologies and to generate revenues would be impaired 
our business depends on generating revenues by licensing our intellectual property rights and by selling products that incorporate our technologies 
if we are not able to protect and enforce those rights  our ability to obtain future licenses or maintain current licenses and royalty revenue could be impaired 
in addition  if a court were to limit the scope of  declare unenforceable or invalidate any of our patents  current licensees may refuse to make royalty payments or may themselves choose to challenge one or more of our patents 
also it is possible that our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  our patents may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which our licensees do business 
we also rely on licenses  confidentiality agreements and copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
it is possible that laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies  and policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks would be difficult  expensive and time consuming  particularly overseas 
product liability claims could be time consuming and costly to defend  and could expose us to loss 
claims that our products or our licensees products have flaws or other defects that lead to personal or other injury are common in the computer peripherals industry and medical fields 
if products that we or our licensees sell cause personal injury  financial loss or other injury to our or our licensees customers  the customers or our licensees may seek damages or other recovery from us 
any claims against us would be time consuming  expensive to defend and distracting to management and could result in damages and injure our reputation or the reputation of our licensees or their products 
this damage could limit the market for our and our licensees products and harm our results of operations 
in the past  manufacturers of peripheral products including certain gaming products such as joysticks  wheels or gamepads  have been subject to claims alleging that use of their products has caused or contributed to various types of repetitive stress injuries  including carpal tunnel syndrome 
we have not experienced any product liability claims to date 
although our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could limit or invalidate the provisions 
the higher cost of products incorporating our touch enabling technologies may inhibit or prevent the widespread adoption and sale of products incorporating our technologies 
personal computer gaming peripherals and automotive and industrial controls incorporating our touch enabling technologies are more expensive than similar competitive products that are not touch enabled 
although major manufacturers  such as logitech  microsoft  alps electric co  ltd  samsung and bmw  have licensed our technology  the greater expense of products containing our touch enabling technologies as compared to non touch enabled products may be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption and sale of touch enabled products 

table of contents competition between our products and our licensees products may reduce our revenue 
rapid technological change  short product life cycles  cyclical market patterns  declining average selling prices and increasing foreign and domestic competition characterize the markets in which we and our licensees compete 
we believe that competition in these markets will continue to be intense  and that competitive pressures will drive the price of our products and our licensees products downward 
these price reductions  if not offset by increases in unit sales or productivity  will cause our revenues to decline 
we face competition from unlicensed products as well 
our licensees or other third parties may seek to develop products using our intellectual property or alternative designs to our intellectual property  which they believe do not require a license under our intellectual property 
these potential competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do  and the costs associated with asserting our intellectual property rights against such products and such potential competitors could be significant 
moreover  if such alternative designs were determined by a court not to require a license under our intellectual property rights  competition from such unlicensed products could limit or reduce our revenues 
competition from new competitors in the medical market may reduce our revenue 
if the medical simulation market develops as we anticipate  we will probably have a greater number of competitors and may have competition in product lines where we have previously enjoyed sole supplier status 
increased competition may result in the reduction of our market share and or cause us to reduce our selling prices which may result in a decline in our revenue 
if we are unable to continually improve  and reduce the cost of  our technologies  companies may not incorporate our technologies into their products  which could impair our revenue growth 
our ability to achieve revenue growth depends on our continuing ability to improve  and reduce the cost of  our technologies and to introduce these technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  companies may not incorporate our technologies into their products and our revenue growth may be impaired 
if we fail to develop new or enhanced technologies for new applications and platforms  we may not be able to create a market for our technologies or our technologies may become obsolete and our ability to grow and our results of operations might be harmed 
our initiatives to develop new and enhanced technologies and to commercialize these technologies for new applications and new platforms may not be successful 
any new or enhanced technologies may not be favorably received by consumers and could damage our reputation or our brand 
expanding our technology could also require significant additional expenses and strain our management  financial and operational resources 
moreover  technology products generally have relatively short product life cycles and our current products may become obsolete in the future 
our ability to generate revenues will be harmed if we fail to develop new technologies  the technologies we develop infringe on existing non immersion patents  our new technologies fail to gain market acceptance  or our current products become obsolete 
we depend on a single supplier to produce some of our medical simulators and may lose customers if this supplier does not meet our requirements 
we have one supplier for some of our custom medical simulators 
any disruption in the manufacturing process from our sole supplier could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products  ensure quality 
table of contents workmanship and could result in a reduction of our product sales 
additionally  the single supplier could increase prices and thereby erode our margins before we are able to find an alternative source 
medical licensing and certification authorities may not endorse or require use of our technologies for training purposes  significantly slowing or inhibiting the market penetration of our medical simulation technologies 
several key medical certification bodies  including the american board of internal medicine  or abim  and the american college of cardiology  or acc  have great influence in endorsing particular medical methodologies  including medical training methodologies  for use by medical professionals 
in the event that the abim and the acc  as well as other  similar bodies  do not endorse our medical simulation training products as a training vehicle  market penetration for our products could be significantly and adversely affected 
automobiles incorporating our touch enabling technologies are subject to lengthy product development periods  making it difficult to predict when and whether we will receive per unit automotive royalties 
the product development process for automobiles is very lengthy  sometimes longer than four years 
we do not earn per unit royalty revenue on our automotive technologies unless  and until  automobiles featuring our technologies are shipped to customers  which may not occur until several years after we enter into an agreement with an automobile manufacturer 
throughout the product development process  we face the risk that an automobile manufacturer or supplier may delay the incorporation of  or choose not to incorporate  our technologies into its automobiles  making it difficult for us to predict the per unit automotive royalties we may receive  if any 
after the product launches  our royalties still depend on market acceptance of the vehicle  which is likely to be determined by many factors beyond our control 
we might be unable to retain or recruit necessary personnel  which could slow the development and deployment of our technologies 
our ability to develop and deploy our technologies and to sustain our revenue growth depends upon the continued service of our management and other key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
management and other key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short notice 
the loss of management or key personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we believe that our future success will also depend largely on our ability to attract  integrate and retain sales  support  marketing and research and development personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating and retaining such personnel 
given the protracted nature of if  how and when we collect royalties on new design contracts  it may be difficult to craft compensation plans that will attract and retain the level of salesmanship needed to secure these contracts 
some of our executive officers and key employees hold stock options with exercise prices considerably above the current market price of our common stock 
each of these factors may impair our ability to retain the services of our executive officers and key employees 
our technologies are complex and we rely upon the continued service of our existing engineering personnel to support licensees  enhance existing technology and develop new technologies 
our major stockholders retain significant control over us  which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate governance matters and could also affect the volatility of our stock price 
we have  and had in the past  and may have in the future  stockholders who retain greater than  or in some cases greater than  of our outstanding stock 
acting together  these stockholders would be able to exercise significant influence over matters that our stockholders vote upon  including the election of directors and mergers or other business combinations  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over or merging with us 
further  if any individuals in this group elect to sell a significant portion or all of their holdings of our common stock  the trading price of our common stock could experience volatility 

table of contents because personal computer peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies currently must work with microsoft s operating system software  our costs could increase and our revenues could decline if microsoft modifies its operating system software 
our hardware and software technology for personal computer peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies is currently compatible with microsoft s windows  windows  windows me and windows xp operating systems software  including directx  microsoft s entertainment applications programming interface 
if microsoft modifies its operating system  including directx  we may need to modify our technologies and this could cause delays in the release of products by our licensees 
if microsoft modifies its software products in ways that limit the use of our other licensees products  our costs could increase and our revenues could decline 
legislative actions  higher insurance cost and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to impact our future financial position and results of operations 
there have been regulatory changes  including the sarbanes oxley act of  and there may potentially be new accounting pronouncements or additional regulatory rulings which will have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations 
the sarbanes oxley act of and other legal changes as well as proposed legislative initiatives following the enron bankruptcy are likely to increase general and administrative costs 
in addition  insurers are likely to increase premiums as a result of high claims rates over the past year  which we expect will increase our premiums for our various insurance policies 
further  proposed initiatives are expected to result in changes in certain accounting rules  including legislative and other proposals to account for employee stock options as a compensation expense 
these and other potential changes could materially increase the expenses we report under generally accepted accounting principles  and adversely affect our operating results 
if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss such as fire  flood  earthquake  power outage or terrorist activity 
california has experienced problems with its power supply in recent years 
as a result  we have experienced utility cost increases and may experience unexpected interruptions in our power supply that could have a material adverse effect on our sales  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  a substantial portion of our research and development activities  manufacturing  our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in san jose  california  an area with a history of seismic events 
any such loss at our facilities could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair and replace the facility 
while we believe that we maintain insurance sufficient to cover most long term potential losses at our facilities  our existing insurance may not be adequate for all possible losses 
we have experienced significant change in our business  and our failure to manage the complexities associated with the changing economic environment and technology landscape could harm our business 
any future periods of rapid change may place significant strains on our managerial  financial  engineering and other resources 
further economic weakness  in combination with our complex technologies  may demand an unusually high level of managerial effectiveness in anticipating  planning  coordinating and meeting our operational needs as well as the needs of our licensees 
we may engage in acquisitions that could dilute stockholders interests  divert management attention or cause integration problems 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past acquired  and may in the future acquire  businesses or intellectual property that we feel could complement our business  enhance our technical capabilities or increase 
table of contents our intellectual property portfolio 
if we consummate acquisitions through cash and or an exchange of our securities  our stockholders could suffer significant dilution 
acquisitions could also create risks for us  including unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions  use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisitions  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel or operations  and potential intellectual property infringement claims related to newly acquired product lines 
any acquisitions  even if successfully completed  might not generate significant additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
our current class action lawsuit could be expensive  disruptive and time consuming to defend against  and if we are not successful  could adversely affect our business

the operative amended complaint is brought on purported behalf of all persons who purchased the common stock of the company from the date of the ipo through december  it alleges liability under sections and of the securities act of and sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  on the grounds that the registration statement for the ipo did not disclose that the underwriters agreed to allow certain customers to purchase shares in the ipo in exchange for excess commissions to be paid to the underwriters  and the underwriters arranged for certain customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at predetermined prices 
the complaint also appears to allege that false or misleading analyst reports were issued 
the complaint does not claim any specific amount of damages 
similar allegations were made in other lawsuits challenging over other initial public offerings and follow on offerings conducted in and the cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes 
on february   the court ruled on all defendants motions to dismiss 
the motion was denied as to claims under the securities act of in the case involving the company  as well as in all other cases except for cases 
the motion was denied as to the claim under section b as to the company  on the basis that the complaint alleged that the company had made acquisition s following the ipo 
the motion was granted as to the claim under section b  but denied as to the claim under section a  as to the remaining individual defendant 
we have decided to accept a settlement proposal presented to all issuer defendants 
in this settlement  plaintiffs will dismiss and release all claims against the immersion defendants  in exchange for a contingent payment by the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the issuers in all of the ipo cases  and for the assignment or surrender of certain claims we may have against the underwriters 
the immersion defendants will not be required to make any cash payments in the settlement  unless the pro rata amount paid by the insurers in the settlement exceeds the amount of the insurance coverage  a circumstance which we believe is remote 
the settlement will require approval of the court  which cannot be assured  after class members are given the opportunity to object to the settlement or opt out of the settlement 

table of contents if we fail to comply with nasdaq s maintenance criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  our common stock could be delisted 
to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market  we are required to comply with one of two sets of maintenance criteria for continued listing 
under the first set of criteria  among other things  we must maintain stockholders equity of at least million  the market value of our publicly held common stock excluding shares held by our affiliates must be at least million  and the minimum bid price for our common stock must be at least per share 
under the second set of criteria  among other things  the market value of our common stock must be at least million or we must have both million in assets and million in revenues  the market value of our publicly held shares must be at least million  and the minimum bid price for our common stock must be at least per share 
as of december   our most recent balance sheet date  we had a deficit in stockholders equity  and therefore would not have been in compliance with the first set of listing criteria as of that date 
although we were in compliance with the second set of criteria  should the price of our common stock decline to the point where the aggregate value of our outstanding common stock falls below million  the value of our publicly held shares falls below million  or the bid price of our common stock falls below per share  our shares could be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
if we are unable to comply with the applicable criteria and our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  it would likely be more difficult to effect trades and to determine the market price of our common stock 
in addition  delisting of our common stock could materially affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock and our future ability to raise necessary capital 
our stock price may fluctuate regardless of our performance 
the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance 
the market price of our common stock has been  and in the future could be  significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  announcements of technical innovations  announcements regarding litigation in which we are involved  new products or new contracts  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of large number of shares of immersion common stock by insiders or others including microsoft  changes in securities analysts recommendations  changing circumstances regarding competitors or their customers  governmental regulatory action  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  inclusion in or exclusion from various stock indices  and general market conditions 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has been initiated against that company  such as the suit currently filed against us 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law may discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares

microsoft corporation  sony computer entertainment inc and sony computer entertainment of america  inc 
on february   we filed a complaint against microsoft corporation  sony computer entertainment  inc  and sony computer entertainment of america  inc in the us district court for the northern district 
table of contents court of california alleging infringement of us patent nos 
 and  the case was assigned to united states district judge claudia wilken 
on april   sony computer entertainment and microsoft answered the complaint by denying the material allegations and alleging counterclaims seeking a judicial declaration that the asserted patents were invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
under the counterclaims  the defendants are also seeking damages for attorneys fees 
the process of discovery and exchanging information and documents on infringement  invalidity  and damages  is ongoing 
on october   we filed an amended complaint  withdrawing the claim under the patent and adding claims under a new patent  us patent no 
 on october   the court entered an amended case management order that set  among other dates in the case  april  for a hearing to construe the claims of the asserted patents and april  for the start of trial 
on october   sony computer entertainment and microsoft answered the amended complaint and alleged similar counterclaims for declaratory relief that the asserted patents are invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
on march   sony computer entertainment filed a motion for summary judgment of non infringement 
at our request  the court ordered this motion stricken  without prejudice to its being refiled at a later date after the court rules on claim construction 
on april   the court held the scheduled claim construction hearing 
on july   the court issued an order modifying case management order that reset certain scheduled dates in the case  including setting april  as the start of trial 
on october   the court issued its claim construction order construing certain terms of the patents asserted in the lawsuit 
on january   sony computer entertainment filed a motion for summary judgment of invalidity and that sony computer entertainment inc should be dismissed as a party 
we filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss sony s defenses that the asserted patents are unenforceable 
on february   the court held a hearing on these motions 
on march   the court issued a written ruling on the summary judgment motions 
the court denied sony s motion for summary judgment of invalidity 
the court granted all but one of immersion s motions and dismissed several sony defenses 
on march  the court rescheduled the trial from april  to april  on july   we announced that we had settled our legal differences with microsoft and we and microsoft agreed to dismiss all claims and counterclaims relating to this matter as well as assume financial responsibility for our respective legal costs with respect to the lawsuit between immersion and microsoft 
we continue to pursue our claims of infringement against sony computer entertainment 
in the event we settle our lawsuit with sony computer entertainment  we will be obligated to pay certain sums to microsoft as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
if sony computer entertainment was successful in its counterclaims and our patents were deemed invalid and unenforceable  the assets relating to the patents that were deemed invalid would be impaired 
for sony computer entertainment to be awarded damages for attorneys fees the court would have to rule that we acted with willful disregard and did not perform a proper investigation 
we currently believe it is remote that a loss may be or has been incurred related to the counterclaims of sony computer entertainment 
the case is scheduled to go to trial in april due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation 
we anticipate that the litigation will continue to be costly  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the costs we incur in connection with the litigation 
we expense litigation costs as incurred and only accrue for costs that have been incurred but not paid to the vendor as of the financial statement date

the forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are identified by words such as anticipates  believes  expects  intends  may  will and other similar expressions 
however  these words are not the only way we identify forward looking statements 
in addition  any statements  which refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances  are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth in item  those described elsewhere in this report and those described in our other reports filed with the sec 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report  and we undertake no obligation to release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements which could occur after the filing of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  patents and intangible assets  inventories  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we recognize revenues in accordance with applicable accounting standards including staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we derive our revenues from three principle sources royalty and license fees  product sales  and development contracts 
we recognize royalty and license revenue based on royalty reports or related information received from the licensee as well as time based licenses of our intellectual property portfolio 
up front payments under license agreements are 
table of contents deferred and recognized as revenue based on either the royalty reports received or amortized over the license period depending on the nature of the agreement 
advance payments under license agreements that also require us to provide future services to the licensee are deferred and recognized over the service period when vendor specific objective evidence related to the value of the services does not exist 
examples of our typical license models are as follows license revenue model revenue recognition perpetual license of intellectual property portfolio based on per unit royalties  no services contracted based on royalty reports received from licensees 
no further obligations to licensee exist 
time based license of intellectual property portfolio with up front payments and or annual minimum royalty requirements  no services contracted based on straight line amortization of an annual minimum up front payments recognized over contract period or annual minimum period 
no further obligations to licensee exist 
perpetual license of intellectual property portfolio or technology license along with contract for development work based on cost to cost percentage of completion accounting method over the service period 
obligation to licensee exists until development work is complete 
license of software or technology  no modification necessary up front revenue recognition based on sop criteria or eitf  as applicable 
we generally license and recognize revenue from our licensees under the above license models or a combination thereof 
individual contracts may have characteristics that do not fall within a specific license model or may have characteristics of a combination of license models 
under those circumstances  we recognize revenue in accordance with sab no 
 eitf no 
and sop  as amended  to guide the accounting treatment for each individual contract 
if the information received from our licensees regarding royalties is incorrect or inaccurate  it could adversely affect revenue in future periods 
to date all information received from our licensees has caused no material reduction in future period revenues 
we recognize revenues from product sales when the product is shipped provided collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligation remains 
we sell the majority of our products with warranties ranging from three to twenty four months 
we record the estimated warranty costs during the quarter the revenue is recognized 
historically  warranty related costs and related accruals have not been significant 
we offer a general right of return on the microscribe g product line for days after purchase 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment of a microscribe system and provide an accrual for potential returns based on historical experience 
no other general right of return is offered on our products 
development contract revenues are recognized under the cost to cost percentage of completion accounting method based on physical completion of the work to be performed 
losses on contracts are recognized when determined 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the conditions become known 
our revenue recognition policies are significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in greater or future operating losses 
we have executed a series of agreements with microsoft corporation as described in note to our consolidated financial statements that provide for settlement of our lawsuit against microsoft as well as various licensing  sublicensing and financing arrangements 
we have accounted for the proceeds received under the agreements as a long term customer advance based on certain provisions that would result in payment of funds to microsoft 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our review and assessment of our customers ability to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
to date such estimated losses have been within our expectations 

table of contents we provide for estimated costs of future anticipated product returns and warranty obligations based on historical experience when related revenues are recognized and defer warranty related revenue over the related warranty term 
we have acquired patents and other intangibles 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  we capitalize the external legal and filing fees associated with patents and trademarks 
we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets and we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we amortize our intangible assets related to patents and trademarks  once they issue  over their estimated useful lives  generally years 
future changes in the estimated useful life could affect the amount of future period amortization expense that we will incur 
during  we capitalized external costs associated with patents and trademarks of million and our amortization expense for the same period was  the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application

results of operations overview of during  we achieved several significant milestones 
we advanced penetration into our core markets and succeeded at gaining market acceptance of new haptics based solutions 
in addition  our medical business was profitable for the full year  driven largely by million in licensing and development revenues associated with agreements signed with medtronic 
we signed a multiyear licensing agreement with samsung  enabling this cell phone innovator to deliver a new generation of phones that include immersion s touchsense touch feedback technology 
we have programs in production or development with four of the top automotive oems spanning europe  asia  and north america and three of the world s most prestigious brands 
we achieved a successful outcome to our litigation with microsoft 
our intellectual property portfolio continued to grow  and we continued to pursue our patent infringement litigation with sony computer entertainment 
during we experienced a decline in medical product sales mainly due to the cautious economic environment and its impact on our customer s ability to secure capital funding for such purchases 
furthermore  our royalty and license revenues were negatively impacted by the decline in the pc gaming market  in part due to the trend away from pc gaming towards console gaming 
during  we continued to pursue our litigation against sony computer entertainment which diverted  and is likely to continue to divert  the efforts and attention of some of our key management and personnel 
we incurred significant costs  million associated with the litigation during the year  as our litigation expenses increased by million from we anticipate that the litigation will continue to be costly  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the costs we incur in connection with the litigation 
the case is scheduled to go to trial in april in  we expect to see continued growth in our business segments as our technology gains further acceptance 
however  our success could be limited by several factors  including the timely release of our new products or our licensees products  continued market acceptance of our products and technology  the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors and the cost of ongoing litigation

our total revenues for the year ended december  were flat compared to the year ended december  while the overall revenue did not increase  the revenue mix did change from to royalty and license revenue 
royalty and license revenue is comprised of royalties earned on sales by our touchsense licensees and license fees charged for our intellectual property portfolio 
royalty and license revenue increased  or from to the increase in royalty and license revenue is a combination of an increase in medical royalty and licensee fees of million and an increase in automotive royalties of  offset by a decrease in gaming royalties of  the significant increase in royalty and license revenue from our medical licensees is primarily due to license revenue of million recognized on our license and development agreements with medtronic 
during the fourth quarter  we achieved the second of 
table of contents three milestones associated with our development and licensing agreements with medtronic 
by delivering a suite of new simulation products in december  which medtronic is currently using for cardiac related therapy training  we were able to recognize million  the majority of which was previously deferred revenue 
of the million recognized  million was included in royalty and license revenue and million was included in development contract and other revenue 
we expect to recognize the remaining license revenue under the agreements during and we have had a series of licensing and development agreements with medtronic since and we will continue to seek additional arrangements in the future

we intend to hold our equity investments for the long term and will monitor whether there has been other than temporary declines in their values based on management s estimates of their net realizable value taking into account the companies respective financial condition and ability to raise third party financing 
if the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment loss is recorded and the individual security is written down to a new cost basis
