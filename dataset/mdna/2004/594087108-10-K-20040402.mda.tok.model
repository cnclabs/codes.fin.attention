item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality 
distribution we currently operate a distribution system that supplies our michaels stores with merchandise  including substantially all seasonal and promotional items 
approximately of michaels stores merchandise is shipped through the michaels distribution system  with the remainder being shipped directly from vendors 
approximately of aaron brothers stores merchandise is shipped through the aaron brothers distribution center  with the remainder being shipped directly from our vendors 
our current distribution centers are located in california  florida  kentucky  pennsylvania  and texas 
in fiscal  we completed an expansion of our california distribution center and added a new distribution facility in hazleton  pennsylvania  which added approximately million square feet of capacity 
in fiscal  we constructed a new distribution center located in the chicago  illinois area  from which we will begin shipping orders in june at the end of fiscal  the lease on our kentucky distribution center will end 
the  square feet of our new illinois distribution center  offset by the closing of our kentucky distribution center  will add approximately  square feet to our approximately million square feet of existing capacity 
in addition to these distribution facilities  we utilize three third party warehouse facilities to store and supply our seasonal merchandise in preparation for the holiday season 
michaels stores generally receive deliveries from the distribution centers each week through an internal distribution network using a dedicated fleet of contract carriers 
aaron brothers stores receive merchandise on a weekly or biweekly basis from their dedicated  square foot distribution center located in the los angeles  california area 
star wholesale stores receive merchandise from direct vendor shipments 
in february  we completed the implementation of a new transportation management system to manage our transportation processes between our vendors  distribution centers  and stores 
once fully utilized  we expect to increase the visibility of merchandise shipments within our supply chain and improve our overall transportation efficiencies 

table of contents we believe that our distribution system  with its planned expansion and new transportation management system  will allow us to maintain sufficient inventory in each store to meet our customers demands while improving control over our overall investment in inventory 
we currently have approximately of our basic skus replenished through our distribution system 
we intend to have approximately of our basic skus replenished through our distribution system  which will reduce our overall supply chain costs and allow us to more effectively manage our inventory investment 
store expansion and relocation having become the largest national retailer of arts  crafts  and decorative items  we recognized in that we had the critical mass to achieve improved operating efficiencies that could result in higher returns on capital by focusing on key initiatives  such as strengthening our information systems and infrastructure to support future growth in the number of stores 
in fiscal  we announced a shift in focus from store growth to higher returns on capital and as a result  moderated our internal growth rate in number of stores 
since fiscal  we have been on an accelerated new store opening program and have maintained that growth through fiscal the following table shows our store growth for the last five years fiscal year michaels stores retail stores open at end of year retail stores opened during the year retail stores closed during the year retail stores relocated during the year aaron brothers stores retail stores open at end of year retail stores opened during the year retail stores closed during the year retail stores relocated during the year recollections stores retail stores open at end of year retail stores opened during the year star wholesale stores wholesale stores open at end of year wholesale store opened during the year wholesale store acquired during the year in keeping with our plans to continue increasing the number of our stores while realizing higher returns on capital  in fiscal  we plan to open approximately michaels  six to eight aaron brothers  and six to eight recollections stores 
we plan to open approximately new michaels stores per year in subsequent fiscal years  extending into the foreseeable future 
in addition  we plan to expand the aaron brothers concept nationwide and open five to new aaron brothers stores per year in subsequent fiscal years  extending into the foreseeable future 
our expansion strategy is to give priority to adding stores in existing markets in order to enhance economies of scale associated with advertising  distribution  field supervision  and other regional expenses 
the anticipated opening of michaels  aaron brothers  recollections  and star wholesale stores and the rate at which stores are opened will depend upon a number of factors  including the success of existing stores  the availability and the cost of capital for expansion  the availability of suitable store sites  and the ability to hire and train qualified managers 

table of contents we have developed a standardized procedure that allows for the efficient opening of new stores and their integration into our information and distribution systems 
we develop the floor plan and merchandise layout and organize the advertising and promotions in connection with the opening of each new store 
in addition  we maintain qualified store opening teams to provide new store personnel with in store training 
costs for opening stores at particular locations depend upon the type of building and general cost levels in the area 
in fiscal  the average net cost of opening a new michaels store included approximately  of leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment  and pre opening costs  and an estimated initial inventory investment  net of accounts payable  of approximately  the total cost of opening a new store depends on the store size  operating format  and the time of year in which the store is opened 
the initial inventory investment in new michaels stores is offset  in part  by vendor allowances 
in addition to new store openings  we continue to pursue a store relocation program to improve the quality and performance of our existing store base 
we relocated and michaels stores in fiscal and  respectively  and one aaron brothers store in fiscal we plan to relocate up to michaels stores during fiscal during fiscal and  we closed seven and five michaels stores  respectively  and in fiscal  we closed four aaron brothers stores 
we currently have no specific plans to close any michaels stores  and plan to close one aaron brothers store  in fiscal investment in information technology we are committed to utilizing technology to increase operating efficiencies and to improve our ability to satisfy the needs of our customers 
the installation of the pos system gave us the ability to better understand the demands of the customer  emerging merchandise trends  and inventory replenishment requirements 
during fiscal  we completed installation of a networked computer system in every store to handle data communications  price management  enhanced radio frequency terminal applications for inventory management  faster credit card authorizations  and gift card processing 
in addition  a standardized warehouse management system utilizing radio frequency terminals with bar code scanning technology was installed in all distribution centers 
in connection with our supply chain initiatives  in fiscal  we implemented a new seasonal allocation system to better manage the allocation of seasonal merchandise to our stores based on prior year sales and current store sales trends 
in addition  in february  we completed the implementation of a new transportation management system to manage our transportation processes between our vendors  distribution centers  and stores 
once fully utilized  we expect to increase efficiency and visibility of merchandise shipments within our supply chain 
in fiscal  we completed the rollout of our perpetual inventory system  and will complete the rollout of our automated replenishment system by july once our perpetual inventory and automated replenishment systems are fully implemented  we expect to improve our stores in stock positions  enhance store labor efficiency  and improve forecasting of merchandise ordering quantities for our vendors 
we believe the implementation of these systems will continue to enhance our inventory management capabilities 
in addition to the information technology enhancements discussed above  we completed the installation of a new integrated financial management package in fiscal to provide an efficient platform for future growth and utilize financial best practices and controls

the suits assert various claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of related to actions prior to michaels announcement on november   that  among other things  it had revised its outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter of  adjusting downward its guidance for annual earnings per diluted share

after investigating such matters alleged in the demand letter and consulting with independent counsel and other professionals  the board excluding the board member referenced in the demand letter determined at a special meeting held on march  that the allegations raised in the demand letter were without merit 
as a result  the board determined that it was not in the best interests of michaels or its stockholders to pursue a civil action against those individuals named in the demand letter

our critical accounting policies include merchandise inventories we value our inventories at michaels stores at the lower of cost or market as determined using a retail inventory method 
because we do not utilize perpetual inventory records to value inventory in our michaels stores  we are required to perform complete physical inventories for a significant sample of stores at the end of each fiscal quarter to estimate ending inventories valued at retail for all michaels stores to be used in our retail inventory model 
our sampling process is designed to count a selection of stores  which are representative of the size  age  and geographic location of the entire chain of stores 
an actual physical count of merchandise is made by third party inventory counting service firms in substantially every store each fiscal year 
we believe our sampling process results in a reasonable estimate of our retail inventory on hand at period end 
in determining our cost of goods sold and ending inventory at cost  we utilize a single pool of inventory for our michaels stores inventories 
at this time  we have no formal plans to change or refine our inventory valuation method  however  we may choose to do so in the future 
we will continue to evaluate our method of inventory valuation as the refinement of our perpetual inventory system enhances our inventory valuation capabilities 
our success in managing our inventories is dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and supplies used in creative activities 
if we misjudge the market  we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns 
permanent markdowns are recorded in the period in which we determine that markdowns will need to be taken to sell certain merchandise 
prior to fiscal  markdowns were generally determined based on retail counts of the affected merchandise on hand at a sample of stores 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  markdowns were determined based on a sample of stores perpetual inventory records 
in fiscal and going forward  markdowns will be based on each store s perpetual inventory records 
amounts recorded for permanent markdowns are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill 
under generally accepted accounting principles in effect through fiscal  goodwill was amortized over its estimated useful life  and was tested periodically to determine if it was recoverable from operating earnings on an undiscounted basis over its useful life 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the provisions of sfas no 
and no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual or  under certain circumstances  more frequent impairment tests 
we adopted these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents the following pro forma financial information reflects net income and diluted earnings per common share as if goodwill were not subject to amortization in fiscal fiscal year in thousands except per share data net income  as reported add back goodwill amortization  net of income taxes pro forma net income pro forma earnings per common share basic diluted we have performed the required impairment tests of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of our reporting units with goodwill  and the tests have not resulted in an impairment charge 
estimated fair value is typically less than values based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
to date  we have not experienced any impairment of our goodwill  however  there can be no assurance that future impairment will not result should our operating results deteriorate for reasons such as those described under risk factors herein 
reserve for closed facilities we maintain a reserve for future rental obligations  carrying costs  and other closing costs related to closed facilities  primarily closed and relocated stores 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition of certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  through the end of the third quarter of fiscal  our accounting policy was to record reserves for these obligations when management committed to closing or relocating a store or facility 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 costs associated with disposal activities  and began recognizing exit costs for any store closures at the time the store is closed 
while the adoption of sfas no 
does not change our policy for calculating store closure reserves  it does change the timing of the recognition of the related expense in future periods 
the cost of closing a store or facility is calculated as the lesser of the present value of future rental obligations remaining under the lease less estimated sublease rental income or the lease termination fee 
once a store has been identified for closure  we accelerate the remaining depreciation so the assets are fully depreciated at the date of closure 
the determination of the reserves is dependent on our ability to make reasonable estimates of costs to be incurred post closure and of rental income to be received from subleases 
in planning our store closures  we generally try to time our exits as close to the lease termination date as possible to minimize the need for sublease income to offset any remaining lease obligation 
the reserves could vary materially if market conditions were to vary significantly from our assumptions 
stock based compensation we have elected to follow apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related guidance in accounting for our employee stock options 
the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and  as a result  we do not recognize compensation expense for stock option grants 

table of contents pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per common share  as required by the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures  the estimated fair value of the options is amortized over the options vesting periods 
our pro forma information is as follows fiscal year in thousands except per share data net income  as reported stock based employee compensation cost as if fair value method were applied  net of income tax pro forma net income earnings per common share  as reported basic diluted pro forma earnings per common share basic diluted pro forma weighted average shares outstanding basic diluted fiscal net income includes the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  net of income tax  related to cooperative advertising allowances

general we report on the basis of a or week fiscal year  which ends on the saturday closest to january references to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year began 
fiscal ended on january   fiscal ended on february   and fiscal ended on february   and each contained weeks 
all references herein to fiscal relate to the weeks ending january  change in accounting principle in november  the eitf reached consensus on issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
issue addresses the accounting for cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor eg  slotting fees  cooperative advertising payments  buydowns and rebates or refunds from a vendor that are payable only if the customer completes a specified cumulative level of purchases or remains a customer for a specified time period 
issue is effective for new arrangements or modifications to existing arrangements entered into after december   although early adoption is permitted 
we elected to adopt early  effective february   the provisions of issue accordingly  in fiscal  we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of million  million net of income tax  for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years 
this adoption also resulted in the reclassification of our cooperative advertising payments earned in fiscal from selling  general  and administrative expense to cost of sales and occupancy expense retroactively as of the beginning of fiscal the fiscal impact on income before cumulative effect of accounting change was immaterial 

table of contents the following pro forma financial information for fiscal reflects the impact of issue as if it had been adopted prior to fiscal fiscal as reported pro forma in thousands except per share data net sales cost of sales and occupancy expense gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense store pre opening costs litigation settlement operating income interest expense other income and expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income earnings per common share basic diluted selected balance sheet information merchandise inventories retained earnings 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of our consolidated statements of income 
this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes 
fiscal year net sales cost of sales and occupancy expense gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense store pre opening costs litigation settlements operating income interest expense other income and expense  net income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change for cooperative advertising allowances  net of income tax net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal fiscal net sales included sales from our new stores opened during the year  partially offset by lost sales from our five store closures  which accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
in addition  our fiscal comparable store sales increase of contributed million to the net sales increase 
comparable store sales growth was strongest in our scrapbooking  frames  seasonal  and general crafts categories 
customer traffic and average ticket each increased approximately from fiscal to fiscal the increase in average ticket was driven primarily by a strengthening of the canadian dollar contributing basis points and favorable pricing product mix trends 
our ability to continue to generate comparable store sales increases is dependent  in part  on our ability to continue to maintain store in stock positions on the top selling items  to properly allocate merchandise to our stores  to effectively execute our sales promotion efforts  to anticipate customer demand and trends in the arts and crafts industry  and to respond to competitors activities 
cost of sales and occupancy expense  as a percentage of net sales  was relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal the overall increase in cost of sales and occupancy expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to fiscal new store growth and our comparable store sales increase of 
selling  general  and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal store compensation costs decreased approximately basis points primarily as a result of a heightened focus on expense control during fiscal in addition  advertising and corporate general and administrative expenses were leveraged on higher net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal the effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the reduction in our fiscal effective tax rate was primarily due to the resolution of certain tax issues  most notably several issues surrounding our canadian subsidiary  which had been pending with the internal revenue service 
based on current projections  we believe our effective tax rate in fiscal will be between and 

table of contents in fiscal  we changed our accounting policy with respect to recording cooperative advertising allowances 
as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income tax  in the first quarter of fiscal for the cumulative effect of accounting change on fiscal years prior to fiscal as a result of the above  net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in fiscal net income before the cumulative effect of accounting change for fiscal was million  or per diluted share 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal fiscal net sales included sales from new stores that were opened during the year  partially offset by lost sales from our store closures  which accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
in addition  our fiscal comparable store sales increase of contributed million to the net sales increase 
comparable store sales growth was strongest in our books  art supplies  kids crafts  framing  and seasonal categories 
cost of sales and occupancy expense  as a percentage of net sales  for fiscal was  a decrease of compared to fiscal this decrease was due in part to a reclassification of million  or of net sales  of fiscal cooperative advertising allowances from selling  general  and administrative expense in connection with our change in accounting policy 
in addition  this decrease as a percentage of net sales was due to improved merchandise margins and a leveraging of store occupancy expense on higher net sales compared to fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million markdown reserve to reflect the net realizable value of certain merchandise that did not conform to each store s specific planogram sku program 
as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal  essentially all of this merchandise had been liquidated and the related markdown reserve was fully utilized as part of the liquidation process 
selling  general  and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a reclassification of million  or of net sales  of fiscal cooperative advertising allowances to cost of sales and occupancy expense in connection with our change in accounting policy 
this increase was partially offset by a leveraging of certain store and corporate expenses  which are fixed in nature  resulting from higher net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal furthermore  as a result of our adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal  amortization expense decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal on june   we negotiated a settlement of the purported class action brought by one of our former assistant managers  taiyeb raniwala 
as a result  we recorded a litigation settlement charge of million in fiscal  covering all claims  attorneys fees  and estimated payroll taxes 
the settlement  in exchange for a full release of claims  received final approval from the court on november   and distribution of the settlement proceeds was made on january  on march   aaron brothers negotiated a settlement of the purported class action brought by suzanne collins  a former aaron brothers assistant manager 
as a result  aaron brothers recorded a litigation settlement charge of million in fiscal  covering all claims  attorneys fees  and estimated payroll taxes 
the settlement  in exchange for a full release of claims  received final approval from the court on june   and distribution of the settlement proceeds was made to the settlement administrator on august  interest expense net of interest income decreased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal  primarily due to a million charge recorded in fiscal in connection with the early extinguishment of our senior notes due and a decrease in interest expense for borrowings under the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement were outstanding for days with a average interest rate for fiscal compared to days with a average interest rate for fiscal 
table of contents in fiscal  we changed our accounting policy with respect to recording cooperative advertising allowances 
as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income tax  in the first quarter of fiscal for the cumulative effect of accounting change on fiscal years prior to fiscal as a result of the above  net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  for fiscal net income before the cumulative effect of accounting change for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  an increase of from fiscal liquidity and capital resources our cash and equivalents increased million  or  from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal we require cash principally for day to day operations and to finance capital investments  inventory for new stores  and seasonal working capital needs 
in recent years  we have financed our operations  new store openings and other capital investments  common stock repurchases  and dividend payments primarily with cash from operations  proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and borrowings under our credit agreement 
cash flow from operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due  in part  to an increase of million in net income as a result of sales growth and a greater focus on expense control 
in addition  we used million less cash in fiscal compared to the prior year to support the increase in merchandise inventories  net of accounts payable  primarily as a result of the timing of inventory purchases and related payments 
inventories per michaels store of million at january  increased from million at february  cash flow from investing activities cash flow from investing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of the following capital expenditure activities fiscal year in thousands new and relocated stores and stores not yet opened existing stores distribution system expansion  net of landlord reimbursements information systems corporate and other proceeds from sale leaseback transaction in fiscal  we incurred capital expenditures related to the construction of our new illinois distribution center  the opening of michaels  aaron brothers  two recollections  and one star wholesale store and the relocation of michaels stores 
in fiscal  we incurred capital expenditures related to the completion of our new hazleton  pennsylvania distribution center  the expansion of our lancaster  california distribution center  the opening of michaels and aaron brothers stores  and the relocation of michaels and one aaron brothers store 
in addition  we received a landlord reimbursement in the amount of million for the expansion of our lancaster  california distribution center  which was completed in fiscal 
table of contents in fiscal  we incurred capital expenditures related to the construction of our new hazleton  pennsylvania distribution center  which was completed in fiscal  the opening of michaels and aaron brothers stores  and the relocation of michaels and five aaron brothers stores 
in fiscal  we received proceeds in the amount of million from the completion of a sale leaseback transaction for two distribution center properties which we purchased in december we currently estimate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal we anticipate spending approximately million to open approximately new michaels  six to eight aaron brothers  and six to eight recollections stores  million for approximately store relocations and improvements in existing stores  million for new and existing distribution centers  million on information systems projects  and million for corporate expansion and various other capital investment activities 
we expect to spend on average approximately million to open a new michaels store  which includes  in net inventory and  of pre opening costs  and  to open a new aaron brothers store  which includes  in net inventory and  of pre opening costs 
we anticipate that our new michaels stores  as a group  will become profitable within their first months of operation 
cash flow from financing activities in july  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due july  in a private placement under securities and exchange commission rule a to a limited number of qualified institutional buyers 
in october  as required by the contract with the purchasers of the senior notes due  we completed a registered exchange of all the privately placed senior notes due for an equal principal amount of senior notes due having substantially identical terms 
the senior notes due are unsecured and interest thereon is payable semi annually on each january and july  beginning on january  the senior notes due are first callable  in part or in full  in july on august   we used a portion of the proceeds of the senior notes due offering described above to redeem our senior notes due  of which million aggregate principal amount was then outstanding 
the redemption price was  per  principal amount of the senior notes due  plus accrued interest to august  we incurred a loss from the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of million in fiscal in june  our board of directors declared our first ever quarterly cash dividend of per share of our common stock 
quarterly cash dividends of per share were also declared in september and december on march   our board of directors approved a cash dividend of per share  to be paid on april   to stockholders of record at the close of business on april  these dividends reflect our strengthening financial position and our board of director s commitment to encouraging long term investment by a diverse stockholder base 
we did not pay any dividends on our common stock during fiscal or the following table sets forth information regarding our common stock repurchase plans as of january  and accordingly does not reflect the february  board of directors authorization for the repurchase of up to an additional million shares of our common stock shares shares authorized for shares available for repurchase repurchased repurchase december  repurchase plan september  repurchase plan june  repurchase plan notes on following page 

table of contents notes from table on preceding page 
on december   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our outstanding common stock 
by later resolutions  our board of directors provided that proceeds of the exercise of options under our general stock option plan may be used to repurchase shares under the repurchase plan and that the maximum number of shares authorized to be repurchased under the repurchase plan may be increased to the extent necessary to so use the proceeds from such option exercises 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we repurchased and subsequently retired  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share under the repurchase plan 
as of april   we had repurchased and retired a total of million shares under the repurchase plan at an average cost of per share and  as a result  we have used the entire fixed portion of the authority originally provided in the repurchase plan 
as of january   no repurchases from proceeds of stock option exercises under the general stock option plan had been made since no options outstanding under the general stock option plan had been exercised as of that date 
during fiscal  we repurchased and subsequently retired the total million shares of our common stock authorized under the repurchase plan at an average cost of per share 
in fiscal  we repurchased and subsequently retired  shares of our common stock authorized under the repurchase plan at an average cost of per share 
we anticipate that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock in fiscal under the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness  we can only repurchase shares of our common stock if we maintain or comply with specified financial ratios and other covenants 
we may also be restricted by regulations of the securities and exchange commission from making future repurchases during certain time periods 
proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options have served as a source of cash for us  and we expect to receive proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options and options to be granted under our stock option plans in the future 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our general stock option plan are required to be used to repurchase shares of our own common stock under the repurchase plan  except where not permitted by law or there is a compelling need to use the proceeds for other corporate purposes 
effective may   we signed a million unsecured revolving bank credit facility with fleet national bank and other lending institutions 
the credit agreement had an original term of three years with a maturity extension for one additional year available under certain conditions and contains a million competitive bid feature and a million letter of credit sub facility 
effective may   pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  our lenders agreed to extend the term of the credit agreement from april  to april  we are in compliance with all terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
during fiscal  we had no borrowings under our credit agreement 
no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of january  or february  borrowings available under the credit agreement are reduced by the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement million as of january  
the following table sets forth certain data related to borrowings under our credit agreement and our previous million bank credit facility fiscal year days of borrowings outstanding average outstanding borrowings in thousands weighted average interest rate 
table of contents general we believe that our available cash  funds generated by operating activities  funds available under the credit agreement  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options will be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures  working capital requirements  and any anticipated dividend payments or stock repurchases for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations all of our significant contractual obligations are fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements  except for arrangements related to operating lease commitments  service contract commitments  and letters of credit  as disclosed in the table below 
in addition  it is not our normal policy to issue guarantees to third parties 
we currently have no commitments for capital leases and do not expect that to change in the immediate future 
as of january   our contractual obligations were as follows payments due by fiscal year less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt operating lease commitments other commitments long term debt includes our senior notes due  which are first callable  in part or in full  in july we pay interest semi annually at a rate of per annum 
our operating lease commitments generally include non cancelable leases for property and equipment used in our operations 
other commitments primarily include service contract obligations and letters of credit 
additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our business is highly seasonal  with higher sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
for the last seven fiscal years  our fourth quarter  which includes the christmas selling season  has accounted for approximately of our sales and approximately of our operating income 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires companies to evaluate variable interest entities to determine whether to apply the consolidation provisions of fin to those entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which a company obtains an interest after that date 
it applies to the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  we have no variable interest entities as defined under the provisions of fin therefore  the adoption of the provisions of fin had no impact on our operating results or financial position 

table of contents risk factors our growth depends on our ability to open new stores our key business strategy is to expand our base of michaels and aaron brothers stores 
if we were unable to implement this strategy  our ability to increase our sales  profitability  and cash flow could be impaired significantly 
to the extent that we are unable to open new stores as we anticipate  our sales growth would come only from increases in comparable store sales 
growth in profitability in that case would depend significantly on our ability to reduce our costs as a percentage of our sales 
we may be unable to implement our strategy if we cannot identify suitable sites for additional stores  negotiate acceptable leases  access sufficient capital to support store growth  or hire and train a sufficient number of qualified associates 
our success will depend on how well we manage our growth even if we are able to implement  to a significant degree  our key business strategy of expanding our store base  we may experience problems  which may prevent any significant increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow 
for example the costs of opening and operating new stores may offset the increased sales generated by the additional stores  the closure of unsuccessful stores may result in the retention of liability for expensive leases  a significant portion of our management s time and energy may be consumed with issues unrelated to advancing our core business strategy which could possibly result in a deterioration of our operating results  our expansion may outpace our planned technological advances with the possible consequences of breakdowns in our supply chain management and reduced effectiveness of our operational controls  we may be unable to hire  train  and retain qualified managers and other associates  our suppliers may be unable to meet the increased demand of additional stores in a timely manner  and we may be unable to expand our existing distribution centers or use third party distribution centers on a cost effective basis to provide merchandise for sale by our new stores 
we may be unsuccessful in our implementation and maintenance of our perpetual inventory and automated replenishment systems although we have completed the rollout of our perpetual inventory system  as of march   we are about complete in the implementation of our automated inventory replenishment system that we believe is necessary to improve store in stock positions and better forecast and manage inventory levels and merchandise ordering quantities for our growing number of stores 
delays in the full utilization of these new systems  or disruptions from an imperfect introduction of these new systems  could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
improvements to our supply chain may not be fully successful an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies  cost reductions  and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to our supply chain  including merchandise ordering  transportation  and receipt processing 
significant changes to our supply chain could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 

table of contents changes in customer demands could materially adversely affect our sales  operating results  and cash flow our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and supplies used in creative activities 
if we misjudge the market  we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns  which would have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow 
however  shortages of key items could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  unfavorable economic trends  and consumer confidence volatility  as a result of  among other things  terrorist attacks  terrorist threats  and war  could have a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results 
conversely  our sales and operating results could temporarily benefit from increased demand for family oriented  at home activities as consumers respond to terrorist threats  attacks  or war  but these benefits may not be sustainable 
our suppliers may fail us many of our suppliers are small firms that produce a limited number of items 
given their limited resources  these firms are susceptible to cash flow issues  production difficulties  quality control issues  and problems in delivering agreed upon quantities on schedule 
we cannot assure you that we would be able  if necessary  to return product to these suppliers and obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain reimbursement or indemnification from them if their products prove defective 
in addition  these suppliers may be unable to withstand a downturn in economic conditions 
significant failures on the part of our key suppliers could have a materially adverse affect on our operating results 
in addition  many of these suppliers require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to supply products in the quantities we desire 
this long lead time requires us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale  exposing us to shifts in demand 
risks relating to foreign suppliers we rely to a significant extent on foreign manufacturers of various products that we sell 
in addition  many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources 
this reliance increases the risk that we will not have adequate and timely supplies of various products due to local political  economic  social  or environmental conditions  transportation delays including dock strikes and other work stoppages  restrictive actions by foreign governments  or changes in united states laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution 
reliance on foreign manufacturers also increases our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates including the potential revaluation of the chinese yuan and trade infringement claims and reduces our ability to return product for various reasons 
all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the united states are subject to duties collected by the united states customs service 
we may be subjected to additional duties  significant monetary penalties  the seizure and the forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import  or the loss of import privileges if we or our suppliers are found to be in violation of us laws and regulations applicable to the importation of our products 
our information systems may prove inadequate we depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business 
we will be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or we are unable to improve  upgrade  maintain  and expand our systems  particularly in light of our continued significant increases in the number of stores 

table of contents a weak fourth quarter would materially adversely affect our operating results our business is highly seasonal 
our inventories and short term borrowings  if any  grow in the second and third fiscal quarters as we prepare for our peak selling season in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
our most important quarter in terms of sales  profitability  and cash flow historically has been the fourth fiscal quarter 
if for any reason our fourth fiscal quarter results were substantially below expectations  our operating results for the full year would be materially adversely affected  and we could have substantial excess inventory  especially in seasonal merchandise that is difficult to liquidate 
competition could negatively impact our operations the retail arts and crafts industry is competitive  which could result in the reduction of our prices and our loss of market share 
we must remain competitive in the areas of quality  price  breadth of selection  customer service  and convenience 
our primary competition is comprised of specialty arts and crafts retailers  which include hobby lobby  ac moore arts crafts  inc  jo ann superstores operated by jo ann stores  inc  and garden ridge corporation 
we also compete with mass merchants  who dedicate a portion of their selling space to a limited selection of craft supplies and seasonal and holiday merchandise  regional chains  and local merchants 
some of our competitors  particularly the mass merchants  are larger and have greater financial resources than we do 
in addition  alternative methods of selling crafts  such as over the internet  could result in additional competitors in the future and increased price competition since our customers could more readily comparison shop 
furthermore  we ultimately compete with alternative sources of entertainment and leisure for our customers 
the amount of debt we have could adversely affect us by reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions our needs for cash in the future will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict  including our results of operations and efforts to expand our existing operations 
we believe  based on current circumstances  that our available cash  funds generated by operating activities  together with available borrowings under our bank credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow at or above current levels 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to repay our debt as it becomes due and make necessary investments  we may be required to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  seek new borrowings  reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional equity capital  or delay  scale back  or eliminate some aspects of our operations  including delaying our plans for new store openings 
moreover  it is possible that we may not be able to satisfy all of the conditions and covenants of our debt 
in addition  to the extent we seek to replace or refinance our current debt  replacement financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain acceptable financing upon the expiration of our bank credit facility 
our ability to obtain additional or replacement financing will be significantly impacted by  among other things  any changes in the ratings assigned to us by nationally recognized ratings agencies 
any of these events  if they were to occur  could have a materially adverse affect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the covenant restrictions in our debt restrict our operations we and our subsidiaries are subject to significant operating and financial restrictions contained in the instruments governing the senior notes due and our other indebtedness 
those restrictions affect  and in many respects significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make various investments  issue or sell our restricted subsidiaries capital stock  engage in transactions with affiliates  make various distributions  
table of contents sell or securitize accounts receivable  provide negative pledges  make capital expenditures beyond specific limitations  engage in derivative transactions other than in the ordinary course of business  create various liens  or merge  consolidate  and sell assets 
in addition  our credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
these restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain financing in the future  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general  or conduct necessary corporate activities 
if we or our subsidiaries fail to comply with these restrictions  we may be in default under the terms of our indebtedness  even if we are otherwise able to meet our debt service obligations 
in the event of a default  the holders of the indebtedness could elect to declare all of that indebtedness  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable and a significant portion of our other indebtedness may become immediately due and payable as a result of cross default clauses contained in documentation evidencing debt 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to make those payments or borrow sufficient funds from alternative sources to make those payments 
even if we were to obtain additional financing  that financing may be on terms unfavorable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements primarily in money market mutual funds and short term interest bearing securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
the fair value of our cash and equivalents at january  approximated carrying value 
the interest rates on our revolving line of credit are repriced frequently  at market rates  which would result in carrying amounts that approximate fair value 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit at january  we believe that the effect  if any  of possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
the fair value of our senior notes due was estimated to be million at january   which was million greater than carrying value 
generally  the fair value of our fixed interest rate long term debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise
