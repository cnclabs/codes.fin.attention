item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes  included elsewhere in this report  and the information contained in selected financial and operating data 
executive summary two overriding factors have heavily influenced the company in recent years and will continue to affect the company in the future the volatility of metal prices and the company s high unit cost structure 
as to metal prices  they are dictated by market forces beyond the control of the company 
as to its unit cost structure  the company has experienced difficulty meeting production targets  achieving sufficient cost efficiencies and realizing anticipated ore grades 
in addition  the company must spend significant amounts of capital annually to maintain sufficient developed areas of the mines to maintain production 
in  the company entered long term sales contracts which  in some cases extend to  and cover the majority of the mines production 
these contracts have floor prices which  in recent years  have been higher than market prices and higher than the company s total cash requirements including capital 
these contracts have allowed the company to continue to generate operating profits in low pricing environments 
if not extended or modified  as to which there can be no assurance  these contracts will expire by at that time  the company could be fully subject to market prices and the absence of these contracts could negatively affect the company s operating results 
the determination to build a second mine at east boulder was made in  a time when palladium prices were rising  and forecast to go higher 
the financing of east boulder was largely done through available cash and bank borrowings  which  ultimately put a financial strain on the company when combined with higher than anticipated capital costs for construction and development 
in recent years the company was obliged to amend its credit agreement on numerous occasions  to seek additional funding through a private placement and to revise its mining plans on several occasions in an effort to optimize its production in light of financial limitations 
ultimately  the company sought a financial partner and considered numerous alternatives 
the company s process led to the stock purchase transaction whereby norilsk nickel acquired of the company through the acquisition of new common shares 
norilsk nickel subsequently completed a cash tender offer thereby increasing their ownership to 
the company believes that it has adequate liquidity for its contemplated needs in view of the cash and palladium received in connection with the share issuance in the norilsk nickel transaction 
the palladium is expected to be sold over the next two years  at close to market prices at the time of sale  with the banks having the option under the credit agreement to receive of the cash proceeds 
the asset impairment charge taken at the end of was precipitated by a decline in reported ore reserves 
the value which the assets were written down to reflects the decreased  and continuing low  palladium price  the high cost structure of the company and uncertainty about the company s ability to obtain favorable long term sales contracts beyond in looking to the future  the company s primary focus will be on profitability 
reducing its costs in relation to revenue from production will continue to be a priority 
the company expects to continually review alternative opportunities to increase revenue and profitability  including promoting new uses for palladium 
while automobile catalytic converters and jewelry have been the largest consumers of pgm s  the company desires to explore other uses on a worldwide basis 
production the company s production of palladium and platinum is a result of the tons of ore mined  the mill head grade and metallurgical recovery 
the company measures its mine production by ounces contained in concentrate reduced by subsequent processing losses expected to be incurred when shipped to the company s smelter  which generally occurs within four days of the ore being mined 
shipment from the company s refinery to a third party refiner generally occurs within days of mining 
approximately days elapse between the time ore is extracted from the mines and the time ounces of recovered precious metal contained in that ore are made available by a third party refiner to the company for sale 
because of the length of the processing cycle and the different cutoff points for identifying production and sales  production may not always correspond to sales in a particular accounting period 
however  any production not shipped from the metal refinery at the end of an accounting period is generally shipped during the first two weeks of the subsequent period and the material is included in the company s in process inventory 
the company records revenue when title passes to its customers 
the ore grade of the company s ore reserves is an average of the composite of all samples 
as is common in an underground mine  the grade mined and the recovery rate achieved will vary depending on the area being mined 
in particular  mill head grade can 
table of contents be expected to vary by up to depending on the area of the mine where extraction is occurring 
during  and  the average mill head grade of total tons processed from the stillwater mine was   and  ounce of pgms per ton of ore  respectively 
the east boulder mine commenced commercial production in during and the average mill head grade of total tons processed from the east boulder mine was and ounce of pgms per ton of ore  respectively 
during  comparable mill head grade for the east boulder mine was ounce per ton  however  the proceeds of all production of pgm s was credited against capitalized mine development as the mine was in the pre production phase 
during  the company s operations produced a total of  ounces  which included  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum 
pgm production decreased from  and was below the company s forecast pgm production for in  the company increased the level of production at the stillwater mine in an area of the mine known as the upper west 
the ore grade from the upper west was lower than the grade for the other ore mined by the company  thus impacting the company s ability to produce ore in line with its prior forecasts 
in addition  production was affected by issues arising from increased msha enforcement activity  which primarily dealt with machinery noise levels  new interpretations of standards and renewed emphasis on explosives use and handling driven by directives from the us department of homeland security 
capitalized mine development mine development expenditures incurred to date to increase existing production  develop new orebodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production have been capitalized and amortized using a units of production method based upon the proven and probable reserves 
mine development expenditures consist of a vertical shaft  multiple surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
many such facilities are required not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
accordingly  these costs are generally amortized based upon the company s estimated proven and probable ore reserves 
the company recorded an impairment charge as of december  the carrying value of the stillwater mine  the east boulder mine and processing facilities in columbus  montana were reduced to their fair market value 
this adjusted carrying amount will become the new cost basis for depreciation and amortization calculation 
through december   the company calculated amortization of capitalized mine development by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate is based upon un amortized expenditures  net of impairment charges  and proven and probable ore reserves  as defined by the securities and exchange commission industry guidelines  as of the beginning of the period 
capital expenditures are added to un amortized capitalized cost as the assets are placed into service 
changes in proven and probable ore reserves are accounted for  in the calculation of the amortization rate  as a prospective change in estimate 
proven and probable ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development expenditures are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimates of proven and probable reserves  could have material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures  are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and access specific reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time and  accordingly  are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
as a result of the asset impairment recorded in  the company reviewed its amortization rate 
beginning in  costs incurred for the development of footwall laterals and ramps will be amortized using the units of production method based upon proven and probable ore reserves within an immediate and relevant vicinity of these infrastructure developments resulting in such costs being amortized over only a portion of the proven and probable reserves 
previously  these additional expenditures have been amortized based upon the company s estimated proven and probable ore reserves 
this change is expected to result in amortization of these costs over a period of to years as compared to amortization based on the total proven and probable ore reserve 
while these infrastructure developments have continuing value for the life of the mine  this change is believed to more closely reflects the economics of these development expenditures incurred to access specific reserves 
the company s proven reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company s estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 
because of the change in ore reserves  the impairment charge and the new amortization method for future development costs  depreciation and amortization will be effected for the year as follows i the impairment charge reduced the carrying value of 
table of contents the east boulder mine  the stillwater mine and the processing and other facilities  the lower book value will result in reduced depreciation and amortization charges in  ii the lower level of reserves  over which certain costs are amortized  will result in a higher charge for depreciation and amortization in  and iii the amortization of certain post mine development expenses over a shorter period  will result in a higher depreciation and amortization charge in it is estimated the depreciation and amortization charge for will be approximately to per ounce 
this compares to approximately per ounce had the impairment adjustments described above not occurred and per ounce  per ounce and per ounce in the years  and  respectively 
revenue the company s revenue and earnings are significantly influenced by worldwide prices of palladium and platinum  which can be volatile and over which the company has no control 
sales to three significant customers represented approximately  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales to these customers were pursuant to long term sales contracts which provide floor and ceiling price structures 
for a description of these contracts see business and properties current operations sales and hedging activities 
although the company sells its metals to a small number of customers and brokers  the company could  if the need were to arise  readily sell its metal on pgm markets throughout the world 
from time to time  the company uses basic hedging techniques involving fixed forwards  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forwards  in an attempt to lock in prices for its production  benefit from price increases or protect against price decreases for a portion of its production within the floor and ceiling prices which exist in the long term sales contracts 
terminal markets exist for both metals and prices are established as metal is traded each day 
such hedging contracts may preclude the company from obtaining the benefit of increased market prices for its contracted metals 
as a result of the company s hedging activities  the company s revenues were favorably impacted in and by million and million  respectively 
there were no recognized gains or losses on hedging transactions during see business and properties sales and hedging activities 
the company may continue to use forward contract and put and call option strategies to manage the potential negative effects of metal price volatility on its financial results 
during  the company entered into fixed forwards that were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
all of these transactions settle in the first three months of the unrealized loss on these instruments due to changes in metal prices was million million  net of tax at december  the company s put and call options are financially settled at maturity 
there were no put or call options outstanding at december  the company has credit agreements with its major trading partners that provide for margin deposits in the event that forward prices for metals exceed the company s hedge contract prices by a predetermined margin limit 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  pgm production 
during  the company produced approximately  ounces of palladium and platinum  which included  ounces of palladium and approximately  ounces of platinum  compared with approximately  ounces which included  ounces of palladium and approximately  ounces of platinum during the decrease is due to the stillwater mine s lower mined production levels of which was partially offset by a increase in production at the east boulder mine 
the stillwater mine produced approximately  ounces of palladium and platinum  consisting of  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum during and the east boulder mine produced approximately  ounces consisting of  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum during revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december   compared with million in  a decrease  and were the result of a decrease in combined realized pgm prices of  and by a decrease in the quantity of metal sold 
palladium sales decreased to approximately  ounces in from approximately  ounces in platinum sales decreased to approximately  ounces in from approximately  ounces in as a result  the total quantity of metal sold decreased to approximately  ounces in from approximately  ounces in the company has long term contracts with its customers for the majority of the production of the mines 
these contracts have floor and ceiling prices which mitigate somewhat the price volatility evident in pgm markets 
the company s combined average realized price per ounce of palladium and platinum sold in decreased to per 
table of contents ounce  compared to per ounce in the combined average market price  as determined in the pgm markets  decreased to per ounce in  compared with per ounce in the company s average realized price per ounce of palladium was per ounce in  a decrease  compared to per ounce for  while the average market price decreased to per ounce in from per ounce in the company s average realized price of platinum sold was per ounce in  compared with per ounce in  while the platinum average market price was per ounce in compared to per ounce in production costs 
total consolidated cash costs per ounce produced in the year ended december  decreased  or  to per ounce from per ounce in the year ended december  the decrease in total consolidated cash costs per ounce is attributed partially to cost cutting measures implemented by the company and partially to the increase in production at the east boulder mine 
total consolidated production costs per ounce in the year ended december  increased  or  to per ounce from per ounce in the year ended december  the increase is due to the decrease in total cash costs per ounce  primarily related to lower mining costs per ounce at the east boulder mine offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization costs of per ounce 
expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  during the year ended december  primarily due to higher corporate administration expense 
the increase of million of norilsk nickel transaction related expenses was for costs recorded in the second quarter relating to the transaction with norilsk nickel 
these costs are not expected to reoccur 
during the year ended december   the company revised its estimate of accrued restructuring costs as a result of negotiations of certain termination clauses of construction contracts which had been cancelled 
the company made adjustments to reduce the accrual by million and million during and  respectively 
during  the company increased its restructuring accrual by million to reflect the decision to eliminate six management positions  which resulted in a net increase in pre tax income of million in interest expense remained constant due to the company s higher loan costs in on its credit facility  offset by the decrease in debt as a result of the norilsk nickel transaction see note 
the higher loan costs are a result of obtaining amendments to the credit agreement 
impairment charge 
the company follows statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces  pgm prices considering current and historical prices  long term sales contract prices  price trends and related factors  production levels  capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projections 
the company disclosed in its quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  that a continuation of palladium prices  at then low levels  would lead to asset impairment writedowns and a reduction of ore reserves which could be material 
the company disclosed that the timing of such writedown or reduction in ore reserves would be evaluated in light of palladium prices and other matters 
ore reserves are determined on an annual basis  and concurrently  mine plans and operating budgets are updated 
the east boulder mine ore reserve at year end increased in contained ounces from that reported at year end however  the stillwater mine ore reserve at year end decreased in contained ounces from that reported at year end overall the company s estimated contained ounces declined by 
the company s ore reserve determination for calculated at december  was ultimately bounded by geologic certainty and largely unaffected by price 
instead  the changes were adjustments for material mined  additions for extension of mine workings and drilling during and changes in mine plans and estimates 
the year end change in ore reserves at the stillwater mine prompted an impairment review of the carrying values of the company s mine properties 
the review determined that company investments in property  plant and equipment at the stillwater mine and east boulder mine were impaired 
consequently  the company performed a fair market value assessment of the assets and recorded an asset impairment charge of million reducing the carrying value of the properties to their fair market value  as required 
the impairment charge consists of million at the stillwater mine  million at the east boulder mine and million at the processing and other facilities  reducing the carrying value of stillwater mine to million  east boulder mine to million and the processing and other facilities to million 
the company engaged an independent appraiser  behre dolbear  who utilized traditional mine valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis for purposes of determining fair market value 

table of contents the resulting net carrying value of the company s mining assets as of december  and is as follows before impairment impairment in thousands charge charge net book value net book value stillwater mine east boulder mine processing assets other assets the reduction in carrying value of these mining assets is not expected to impact the company s employees  mine operations  smelting and refinery operations  delivery of pgms to customers or compliance with the covenants of the company s bank credit facility 
assumptions underlying future cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties 
any differences between significant assumptions and market conditions such as pgm prices  lower than expected recoverable ounces  and or the company s operating performance could have a material effect on the company s determination of ore reserves  or its ability to recover the carrying amounts of its long lived assets resulting in potential additional impairment charges 
income taxes 
the company reported an income tax benefit of million or of pre tax loss for the year ended december  compared to an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  the tax benefit is comprised of a million benefit offset by a million provision for a valuation allowance of the amount of the company s net deferred tax assets 
the tax benefit is further offset by a reduction of deferred tax asset of million resulting from a limitation on the company s net operating loss carry forwards attributed to the ownership change resulting from the norilsk nickel transaction see note 
this compares to an income tax provision of million  or of pre tax earnings for the year ended december  the change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in taxable income from mining that limits the company s statutory depletion for tax purposes  the reversal of timing differences resulting from the asset impairment charges and the valuation allowance provided for the net deferred tax assets see note 
other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
for the year of  other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  included a decline in the market value of commodity instruments of million and of the interest rate swaps of million offset by reclassification adjustments to interest expense of million 
for the same period of  other comprehensive loss of million net of tax  included a decline in the market value on commodity instruments of million and a decline in the market value of the interest rate swaps of million 
other comprehensive loss in also includes reclassification adjustments to earnings of million associated with deferred gains on commodity instruments offset by million associated with losses on interest rate swaps 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  pgm production 
during  the company produced approximately  ounces of palladium and approximately  ounces of platinum  respectively  compared with approximately  ounces of palladium and approximately  ounces of platinum during  which excludes the development ounces recovered from the east boulder mine in of approximately  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum 
the increase was primarily due to the east boulder mine  which commenced commercial production in and produced  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum in this was partially offset by a decrease in production at the stillwater mine primarily due to the lower mill head grade as a result of an increased emphasis in mining the upper west area  which produced  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum in the company s pgm production increased  ounces from  or  but was  ounces  or below the company s september  revised forecast pgm production for at the stillwater mine  the production shortfall was a result of an industrial relations problem experienced during the third quarter of  interruptions arising from increased msha enforcement activity during the fourth quarter of and a lower ore grade than plan as a result of mining in the upper west area 
at the east boulder mine  production was affected by ore grade  which was below the company s target 
revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december   compared with million in  a decrease  and were the result of a decrease in combined realized pgm prices of  offset by a increase in the quantity of metal sold 

table of contents palladium sales increased to approximately  ounces in from approximately  ounces in platinum sales increased to approximately  ounces in from approximately  ounces in as a result  the total quantity of metal sold increased to approximately  ounces in from approximately  ounces in the company has long term contracts with its customers for the majority of the production of the mines 
these contracts have floor and ceiling prices which mitigate somewhat the volatility evident in pgm markets 
the company s combined average realized price per ounce of palladium and platinum sold in decreased to per ounce  compared to per ounce in the combined average market price  as determined in the pgm markets  decreased to per ounce in  compared with per ounce in the company s average realized price per ounce of palladium was per ounce in  compared to per ounce for  while the average market price decreased to per ounce in from per ounce in the company s average realized price per ounce of platinum sold was per ounce in  compared with per ounce in the platinum average market price was per ounce in compared to per ounce in production costs 
total consolidated cash costs per ounce produced in the year ended december  increased  or  to per ounce from per ounce in the year ended december  the increase in total consolidated cash costs per ounce is attributed to a per ounce increase in total cash cost primarily related to placing the east boulder mine into commercial production in and lower production ounces at the stillwater mine due to lower grade 
total consolidated production costs per ounce in the year ended december  increased  or  to per ounce from per ounce in the year ended december  the increase is due to the increase in total cash costs per ounce and an increase in depreciation and amortization costs of per ounce  due to lower production ounces at the stillwater mine and the impact of placing the east boulder mine assets into commercial production during  combined with changes in ore reserve estimates used in calculating depreciation 
expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  during the year ended december   primarily as a result of  i lower costs of million related to reduced project management and recruiting activities associated with the company s previous expansion plan and ii during the year ended december   the company incurred million of severance costs attributable to a management realignment and consulting fees of million 
during the year ended december  the company incurred million related to a settlement of a legal dispute with a terminated refining contract 
during the year ended december   the company revised its estimate of accrued restructuring costs as a result of negotiations of certain termination clauses of construction contracts cancelled 
the company made adjustments to reduce the accrual by million during also  during  the company made an addition to its restructuring accrual of million to reflect the decision to eliminate six management positions  which resulted in a net adjustment to increase pre tax income by million 
interest expense increased million as a result of placing the east boulder mine into production in  which resulted in interest being expensed rather than capitalized 
income taxes 
the company has provided for income taxes of million  or of pretax income  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of pretax income  for the year ended december  other comprehensive loss 
for the year ended december   other comprehensive loss of million  net of tax  includes a decline in the market value of the interest rate swaps of million and a decline in the market value of commodity instruments of million 
other comprehensive loss also includes reclassification adjustments to earnings of million associated with deferred gains on commodity instruments and million associated with losses on interest rate swaps 
for  the company recorded other comprehensive income of million  net of tax  due to the increase in the market value of commodity derivative instruments of million  off set by reclassification adjustments to earnings of million associated with the gains realized on commodity instruments 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to at december  the improved ratio is attributable to the norilsk nickel transaction which resulted in the company receiving cash proceeds  after debt reduction  of million and palladium inventory valued at million 

table of contents for the year ended december   net cash provided by operations was million compared to million for the decrease of million was primarily a result of decreased net income of million  an increase in non cash expenses of million  a decrease in the payments on the restructuring accrual of million and an increase in net operating assets and liabilities of million 
a net total of million of cash was used in investing activities in  compared to a net total of million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease of million is primarily due to a reduction of capital expenditures attributed to the company s focus on reducing its capital expenditures 
the company expects to invest approximately million in capital items in the increase in is primarily due to increased production levels at the east boulder mine from  tons per day  to approximately  tons per day  additional capital investment of metallurgical facilities related to east boulder s increased production levels and the capital expenditures related to smelter furnace re brick 
for the year ended december   cash flow from financing activities was million compared to million for the year ended december  the cash provided by financing activities in were primarily attributed to net proceeds of million from the norilsk nickel stock purchase transaction  offset by payments of million on the company s credit facility and payments for debt issuances costs of million 
for the same period of  cash flow from financing activities of million was primarily attributed to net proceeds of million from the stock purchase transaction  offset by payments of million on the company s credit facility

letters of credit of million were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
during  the company will be required to make total payments of approximately million in principal reductions to its debt which includes million in scheduled principal payments on the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
the company will also be required to pay approximately million in total interest payments 
at december   the company owned  ounces of palladium inventory received on june  in the norilsk nickel stock transaction 
the inventory is carried on the balance sheet at per ounce  which results in a carrying value million 
at december  the palladium market price was per ounce 
in the first quarter of  the company announced that it had entered into contracts or had reached understandings  under which all of the palladium will be sold at close to market prices at the time of sale 
the company is required to offer of the proceeds from the sale of the inventory to repay loans under the company s credit agreement

additional information regarding factors which could cause results to differ materially from management s expectations is found in the section entitled risk factors above 
critical accounting policies mine development expenditures capitalization and amortization mining operations are inherently capital intensive  generally requiring substantial capital investment for the initial and concurrent development and preparation of the mine 
many of these expenditures are necessarily incurred well in advance of actual extraction of ore 
underground mining operations such as those conducted by the company require driving tunnels and sinking shafts that provide access to the underground orebody and construction and development of infrastructure  including electrical and ventilation systems  rail and other forms of transportation  shop facilities  material handling areas and hoisting systems 
ore mining and removal operations require significant underground facilities used to conduct mining operations and to transport the ore out of the mine to processing facilities located above ground 
contemporaneously  as ore is mined  additional ongoing development is undertaken to provide access to the extension of the orebody  allowing additional ore to be produced 
in addition to the development costs that have been previously incurred  these ongoing development expenditures are necessary to access all ore that is expected to be mined 
the company s proven ore reserves are based on interpolation between closely spaced diamond drill holes which intersect the j m reef and reflect the information required for detailed mine planning 
probable ore reserves are based on interpolation between sample points where sample spacing is greater than that for proven reserves or extrapolation from sample points 
a significant portion of the probable ore reserves are based on extrapolation 
the probable ore reserve areas are expected to be converted to proven ore reserves as the mine is developed 
the factors used for determining the amount of probable ore reserves are estimated based on statistical analysis of the diamond drilling adjacent to these areas 
the actual results for specific reserve blocks may be different than that estimated in the determination of probable ore reserves 
any changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the estimates of probable ore reserves to be recovered over the life of the mine resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuation of the related assets 
mine development expenditures incurred to date to increase existing production  develop new orebodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized and amortized using a units of production method based upon the proven and probable reserves 
mine development expenditures consist of a vertical shaft  multiple surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
many such facilities are required not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
accordingly  these costs are generally amortized based upon the company s estimated proven and probable ore reserves 
through december   the company calculated amortization of capitalized mine development by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate is based upon un amortized expenditures  net of impairment charges  and proven and probable ore reserves 
capital expenditures are added to un amortized capitalized cost as the assets are placed into service 
changes in proven and probable ore reserves are accounted for  in the calculation of the amortization rate  as a prospective change in estimate 
proven and probable ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development expenditures are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan  a change in estimates of proven and probable reserves or a change in economic assumptions could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations the of related assets 
the company s proven reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company s estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 

table of contents expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and access specific reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time and  accordingly  are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
as a result of the asset impairment recorded in  the company reviewed its amortization rate 
beginning in  costs incurred for the development of footwall laterals and ramps will be amortized using the units of production method based upon proven and probable ore reserves within an immediate and relevant vicinity of these additional infrastructure developments resulting in such costs then being amortized over only a portion of the proven and probable reserves 
the change is expected to result in amortization of these costs over a period of to years as compared to amortization based on total proven and probable ore reserves 
while these infrastructure developments have continuing value for the life of the mine  this change is believed to more closely reflects the economics of these development expenditures incurred to access specific reserves 
asset impairment the company follows statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of its assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than carrying amount of the asset 
future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces  pgm prices considering current and historical prices  long term sales contracts prices  price trends and related factors  production levels and capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projection 
if the assets are impaired  a calculation of fair market value is performed  and if fair market value is lower than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are reduced to their fair market value 
assumptions underlying future cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties 
any differences between significant assumptions and market conditions such as pgm prices  lower than expected recoverable ounces  and or the company s operating performance could have a material effect on the company s determination of ore reserves  or its ability to recover the carrying amounts of its long lived assets resulting in potential additional impairment charges 
see note income taxes income taxes are determined using the asset and liability approach in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax rates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance has been provided at december  for the portion of the company s net deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that they will not be realized see note 
reclamation and environmental costs effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 

table of contents the company s current bonding requirements total approximately million at december  the current bond amount is an estimate of reclamation and closure costs 
the regulatory agencies review the bonding requirements and reclamation estimates on a year rotation or anytime a major amendment to the operating permits is approved 
the company expects that the stillwater mine bond will be reviewed and adjusted by the regulatory agencies during any differences between the estimated amounts and actual post closure reclamation and site restoration costs could have a material effect on the company s estimated liability resulting in a change in the recorded amount 
the accrued reclamation liability was approximately million at december  see note 
hedging program from time to time  the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including fixed forwards  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forwards to manage the effect of changes in the prices of palladium and platinum on the company s revenue 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these instruments were accounted for as hedges when the instrument is designated as a hedge of the related production and there exists a high degree of correlation between the fair value of the instrument and the fair value of the hedged production 
the degree of correlation is assessed periodically for effectiveness or ineffectiveness 
in the event that an instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge designation  any subsequent gain or loss on the instrument is recognized immediately in earnings 
otherwise  gains or losses related to hedging transactions are recognized as adjustments to the revenue recorded for the related production 
if an instrument is settled early  any gains or losses are deferred and recognized as adjustments to the revenue recorded for the related hedged production 
costs associated with the purchase of certain hedging instruments are deferred and amortized against revenue related to the hedged production 
the company accounts for its derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
which requires that derivatives be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value must be recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the company primarily uses derivatives to hedge metal prices and manage interest rate risk 
as of december  the outstanding derivatives associated with commodity instruments are valued at an unrealized loss of million million  net of tax  and are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december   the outstanding interest rate swaps are valued at an unrealized loss of million  net of tax  and are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income see note 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in metal prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells palladium  platinum and associated by product metals directly to its customers and also through third parties 
as a result  financial risks are materially affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
in order to manage commodity price risk and to reduce the impact of negative fluctuation in prices  the company enters into long term contracts and uses various derivative financial instruments 
because the company hedges only with instruments that have a high correlation with the value of the hedged transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are expected to be offset by changes in the value of the hedged transaction 
the company has entered into long term sales contracts with general motors corporation  ford motor company and mitsubishi corporation 
the contracts apply to the portions of the company s production over the period through december and provide for a floor and ceiling price structure 
in the first quarter of the company also entered new sales contracts or had reached understandings  under which all of the  ounces of palladium will be sold  at close to market prices at the time of sale  over a period of two years primarily for use in automobile catalytic converters 
see business and properties pgm sales and hedging activities see note during  the company entered in fixed forwards that were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
these sales of metals from processing secondary materials are sold forward at the time of receipt and delivered against the cash flow hedges when the ounces are recovered 
the company expects these transactions to settle in the first three months of the unrealized loss on these instruments due to changes in metal prices at december  was million million net of tax 
there was no recognized gain or loss on commodity instruments during the company utilizes financially settled forwards and cashless put and call 
table of contents option collars 
under financially settled forwards  at each settlement date  the company receives the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is below the forward price and the company pays the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is above the forward price 
the company s financially settled forwards are settled at maturity 
under cashless put and call option collars  at each settlement  the company receives the difference between the put price and the market price if the market price is below the put price and the company pays the difference between the call price and the market price of the market price is above the call price 
a period of continuous low commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on the calculation of the company s ore reserves 
interest rate risk as of december   the company had million outstanding under the term b facility  bearing interest at a variable rate of based on a libor rate of plus a spread of see note 
during the first quarter of  the company entered into two identical interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps fixed the interest rate on million of the company s debt 
the interest rate swap agreements were effective march  and mature on march  the agreements require the company to pay interest at a fixed rate of and receive interest at a rate based on london interbank offered rate libor  which is adjusted on a quarterly basis 
the adjusted quarterly rate at december  was 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on the portion of its credit facility in excess of million  since the credit facility carries a variable interest rate based upon libor
