overview we provide cross platform systems and security management software  web analytics software and related services 
our systems and security management solutions enable organizations to monitor  and proactively manage their it infrastructure to assure the performance  availability  security  and more efficient utilization of their it environments 
while our business initially was focused on management of systems and applications running on the microsoft windows operating system  we have expanded our business to include cross platform systems management solutions and security management solutions for the windows  unix  linux and ibm iseries operating systems  as well as offering web analytics software solutions 
our strategy broadened after entering into an agreement with microsoft in september pursuant to this agreement we granted to microsoft a non exclusive perpetual license to our operations manager product and technology in exchange for million in license revenue  payable in scheduled installments over three years  plus payment of an additional million in marketing funds over three years 
microsoft has further developed this technology and offers basic systems management functionality for some versions of its windows operating systems and some microsoft applications 
following entry into the agreement with microsoft  we began a broad diversification program to develop additional revenue streams and to extend our principal systems management product suite  appmanager 
revenue from customers other than microsoft grew from fiscal to fiscal but declined from fiscal to appmanager license revenue  which represented approximately of all non microsoft license revenue in fiscal  has remained relatively flat since fiscal excluding the fees from microsoft  total revenue growth from fiscal through fiscal has been derived principally from increases in revenue from the provision of maintenance and other services 
since fiscal  to maintain the appmanager license revenue stream  we expanded its capabilities to provide support for other operating systems  principally unix and linux  and increased support of non microsoft applications 
to extend beyond systems management  we acquired webtrends corporation in march  adding software solutions for tracking  reporting and analyzing web site traffic and usage to our product portfolio  and we have further expanded these product solutions since that time 
we also focused our expansion strategy on developing and acquiring security management products due to the anticipated convergence of systems and security management technologies and our perception of customer needs 
we used an existing technology to develop products to manage security events 
we acquired security firewall monitoring technology as part of the webtrends acquisition and in december we acquired pentasafe security 
table of contents technologies  inc and marshal software  ltd  both companies with security management technologies 
during the balance of fiscal and in fiscal we integrated and further developed these products and technologies  releasing a focused set of security management products in the fourth quarter of fiscal from fiscal through fiscal  our revenue benefited substantially from license fees from the microsoft agreement  million of total revenue in fiscal  million of total revenue in fiscal  and million of total revenue in fiscal the last payment of million of total revenue was received in the first quarter of fiscal our operating margin also benefited from the license fees from the microsoft agreement as costs related to this revenue stream were insignificant 
however  as part of our expansion strategy we increased spending  particularly in research and development  in fiscal and fiscal  to develop and refine our products and those acquired through our acquisitions 
through the development and acquisition of a comprehensive security management product portfolio  and the convergence of systems and security management markets  we have positioned netiq to benefit from growth of the security management market 
prior to fiscal  we focused on marketing our systems management products principally to system or network administrators  and customer purchase approval levels were generally below the level of the chief information officer 
as we expanded our product offerings and focused on broader solutions  it became increasingly important to develop broad based relationships with our customers and to cultivate relationships at higher levels in our customers information technology it organization 
beginning in july we refocused our sales strategy from territory based to a named account based approach to better address the needs of customers and to focus our sales efforts more on product suites rather than individual products 
as a result of the reorganization of our sales team following our acquisition of pentasafe  the changing focus of our sales organization and the soft spending environment for it products generally  we had high turnover of sales personnel and the productivity of our sales force did not meet our expectations during the second half of fiscal and through fiscal during fiscal  we implemented expanded product  solution and process training 
as our sales strategy matured throughout fiscal  turnover of sales personnel abated significantly 
as a result of the decreasing revenue received under the microsoft agreement  integration and restructuring costs related to our acquisitions and low sales force productivity  our operating margins were under heavy pressure during the and fiscal years 
also  because our growth strategy was dominated by acquisitions  some of which were consummated at high valuations prior to the decline in stock prices after fiscal  our financial results were subjected to revaluation charges and impairments of goodwill 
upon our adoption  in july  of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluated the fair value of goodwill and took a transitional impairment charge of million  characterized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during fiscal and fiscal  we incurred further impairment charges of million and million  respectively  leaving a balance of million in goodwill at june  in connection with our acquisition of pentasafe in december and the resizing of the combined businesses  we adopted a plan to eliminate redundant positions in both the netiq and pentasafe workforces and to vacate excess facilities 
we terminated the employment of employees of pentasafe and accrued million related to severance benefits which we accounted for as part of the acquisition of pentasafe 
we also terminated the employment of netiq employees and vacated certain of our leased facilities  resulting in a charge of million  reflected as a restructuring charge in the second quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced a further reduction in force designed to lower operating costs and to better support the convergence of the systems management and security management markets  by combining our systems and security management business units and streamlining our organizational structure 
as a result  we terminated the employment of employees  including four senior executives 
total severance costs of million relating to this reduction in force were recorded as sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses in fiscal 
table of contents in october we announced a more sharply focused strategy for fiscal and identified five key priorities refine and narrow our focus to five major product lines in our systems and security management business  renew contact with and re sell appmanager to our existing customers  sell to our current appmanager customers our other major product lines  revise our marketing and sales strategy for windows administration products  and improve sales force productivity and operating performance 
the strategic focus in fiscal was largely successful 
we refocused our systems and security management development teams  sales force and partners around five key product areas appmanager suite  vigilent security manager  security manager and vigilent log analyzer  windows administration products and our marshal family of content security solutions 
our efforts resulted in major product releases in each of these areas  the enhancement and re branding of vigilent security manager as netiq vulnerability manager  the consolidation and enhancement of security manager and vigilent log analyzer as netiq security manager and the training of sales teams  partners and customers 
recently  we further narrowed our product priority to three major systems and security management product areas  appmanager suite  netiq security manager  and netiq vulnerability manager  in addition to our webtrends products 
each of these major products has been recently upgraded 
we also sold or licensed others to further develop and distribute lower volume products such as sql tools  chariot  and some appmanager modules  freeing up development resources to focus on the major product areas 
finally  we acquired the group policy administrator and group policy guardian products within the windows administration product family and webposition gold in the web analytics product family 
our senior executives  sales personnel and product management personnel developed programs to work with our existing appmanager accounts  ensuring they understood the benefits and capabilities of the appmanager suite of products 
this resulted in increased maintenance renewals for appmanager products as well as increased sales of new licenses  including licenses for our unix linux cross platform management products 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  revenue for appmanager products was up year over year 
as a result of greater involvement with our customers and renewed success of appmanager suite  about half of our larger transactions in the third and fourth quarters also included other products  typically security management products 
in addition  by repositioning windows administration products  revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal for these products was up substantially year over year 
improving sales force productivity is continuing to receive our greatest attention 
we believe that our major account focus is appropriate and is enhancing our relationships within accounts 
as well  turnover of sales personnel declined every quarter during fiscal  and our program of significant additional product and process training appears to be improving sales capability 
the first sign of our improved sales productivity has been the rise in sales pipeline  which represents all of our sales opportunities  throughout fiscal  which we expect to result in further improvements in order rate in fiscal in june  we restructured our business in an effort to enhance our customers experience with netiq products and services by creating a more efficient business and to enable better collaboration between key functions 
our security management development activities and our systems and security technical support operations were consolidated in houston  texas 
to better align our internal information systems with our business units we also reorganized our it department 
in connection with this restructuring  we terminated the employment of employees and vacated a facility in portland oregon and a facility in auckland  new zealand  resulting in a restructuring charge of million 
in the financial statements this charge is partially offset by a  recovery of the fiscal restructuring charge 
we anticipate improving operating performance in fiscal as a result of this restructuring 
our growth strategy has become more focused on growing revenue from internally developed products and solutions since we believe we have many of the technology building blocks necessary to develop valuable solutions for our customers 
however  we intend to continue to acquire small companies  products and technologies as well as to enter into strategic alliances that complement our overall technology and solutions strategy 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses and involve management s judgment regarding significant estimates 
the critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition we primarily generate revenue from licensing software and providing related services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  as set forth in american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and aicpa sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and other related pronouncements 
in accordance with these statements  we recognize revenue upon meeting each of the following criteria existence of persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
persuasive evidence generally is a purchase order  license agreement or other contract 
delivery of product and authorization keys 
delivery has occurred when the customer is given online access to the software and the authorization keys needed to activate the software are made available to the customer 
fee is fixed or determinable 
a fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable when it is not subject to subsequent refund or adjustment 
collection is deemed probable 
vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate fees to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
we recognize software revenue using the residual method 
under the residual method revenue is recognized if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for all of the undelivered elements in an arrangement and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
vsoe is based on the price generally charged when the element is sold separately 
in situations where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for an undelivered element does not exist  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized when fair value can be established for all undelivered elements or when all elements are delivered and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
service revenue includes maintenance revenue  usage and subscription based revenue from our hosted services offerings and revenue from consulting and training services 
we defer license revenue until all of the criteria noted above are met 
we defer maintenance revenue and recognize it ratably over the maintenance term  typically one year 
we defer advance payments for hosted services and recognize such revenue based upon page views or ratably over the term of the contract 
we defer consulting and training revenues and recognize them as those services are performed 
we generally recognize revenue from sales made through distributors  resellers  and original equipment manufacturers at the time these partners report that they have sold the software or  alternatively  when we drop ship the product to the end user  in each case after all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recognize revenue from sales made to international master distributors of web analytics products when sold to the master distributor once all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
additionally  we monitor master distributor inventory levels  accounts receivable aging  and the distributor credit history and current credit rating in order to determine that collection is probable 
we also maintain an allowance for potential sales returns 

table of contents when licenses and services are sold together  we recognize license fees upon shipment  provided that the above criteria have been met  payment of the license fee is not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the services do not provide significant customization of the software and are not essential to the functionality of the software for which a license was sold 
for arrangements that do not meet the above criteria  we defer revenue recognition until all of the criteria are met 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under current circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and our best estimates and judgments may require further adjustments  therefore actual results could differ from our current estimates 
significant estimates made in the accompanying financial statements are allowance for uncollectible accounts we provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and an analysis of the remaining accounts receivable 
changes in the allowance are included as a component of general and administrative expense on the statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts was  at june   million at june  and million at june  reflecting our stronger customer base and focused improvements by our credit and collection team 
allowance for sales returns we provide an allowance for sales returns in the same period the related revenues are recorded 
the estimates are based on historical trends in product returns 
revenue is recognized net of the provision for sales returns 
the allowance for sales returns was  at june   million at june  and million at june  reflecting improved management of product returns 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the sales return allowance would be made in the period such determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
other intangible assets we record intangible assets when we acquire companies 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain identifiable intangible assets such as purchased technology and customer lists are amortized over time  while in process research and development is recorded as a charge on the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized  subject to periodic review for impairment 
accordingly  the allocation of the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
should conditions be different than management s assessment  material write downs of the fair value of intangible assets may be required 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives and capitalized value of our other intangible assets 
a reduction in the estimate of remaining useful life and capitalized value could result in accelerated amortization expense or a write down in future periods 
goodwill under the current accounting guidelines adopted on july  we ceased amortization of goodwill but periodically assess remaining value for impairment 
accordingly  goodwill recorded in business combinations may significantly affect our future operating results to the extent impaired  but the magnitude and timing of any such impairment is uncertain 
when we conduct our annual evaluation of goodwill  as of april  or in the interim if impairment indicators are identified with respect to goodwill  the fair value of goodwill is re assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment 
should conditions be different than management s last assessment  significant write downs of goodwill may be required 
goodwill as of june  was million 
restructuring liabilities and facility reserves we regularly evaluate the utilization of our facilities and when future use of a specific facility is no longer required and no longer occupied  we record a charge for the 
table of contents remaining costs  net of any sublease or other recoveries anticipated 
in connection with our significant acquisitions and from time to time in an effort to better respond to customer needs  to reduce operating costs or to facilitate better collaboration between organizations  we also restructure our operating activities and organizations  eliminating redundancies in personnel and facilities 
establishing reserves for unoccupied facilities typically involved greater judgment than for personnel as sublease rental income or other recoveries are more difficult to estimate than severance benefits or salary continuation payments 
at june   we had million reserved for unoccupied facilities and  reserved for employee severance benefits 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes includes taxes currently payable and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are principally the result of the tax benefit of disqualifying dispositions of stock options  which will be credited to equity when realized 
we have established a valuation allowance to fully reserve deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty regarding their realization 
results of operations total revenue 
total revenue and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except percentages percentage change to to software license revenue software license revenue under microsoft agreement total software license revenue service revenue total revenue revenue as of total revenue inclusive of microsoft revenue revenue as of total revenue exclusive of microsoft revenue software license revenue software license revenue under microsoft agreement n a n a n a total software license revenue service revenue total revenue total revenue decreased by million or  from fiscal to and increased by million or from fiscal to software license revenue 
total software license revenue decreased by million or from fiscal to  primarily due to a million decrease in revenue under the microsoft agreement during fiscal software license revenue  excluding revenue from the microsoft agreement  decreased million or from fiscal to this decrease was primarily a result of low productivity of the sales organization  confusing product positioning regarding some of our security management products  lack of integration of our security management products  a delay in releasing a new version of our webtrends software and the continued challenging economic environment 
in addition  an increasing percentage of our webtrends customers are using our hosted service rather than buying our software  resulting in a shift from license revenues to service revenues 

table of contents the decrease in license revenue from to together with improved maintenance revenue and other service revenue resulted in a decline of license revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
total software license revenue decreased by million or from fiscal to  primarily due to a million decrease in revenue under the microsoft agreement during fiscal this decrease was partially offset by inclusion of license revenue from our acquisitions of pentasafe and marshal and growth in our non microsoft revenue for a total increase in non microsoft revenue of million  or during the same period 
software license revenue  excluding revenue from the microsoft agreement  as a percentage of total revenue has declined from fiscal to the decrease in the percentage of software license revenue to total revenue resulted in part due to the inclusion of a full year of webtrends hosted service revenue and an increase in maintenance revenue 
pursuant to the schedule of payments set forth in the agreement with microsoft  software license revenue from microsoft began a sequential decline in the quarter ended december  with the final payment received during the first quarter of fiscal service revenue 
service revenue consists of revenue from the sale of maintenance service agreements  consulting services and training services  as well as the sale of hosted web analytics services 
maintenance revenue represented  and of total service revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the declining percentage of maintenance revenue is due to increases in hosted services revenue and consulting and training revenue 
service revenue increased by million and million  or and  from fiscal to and from fiscal to  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to additional maintenance fees associated with new software licenses  renewals by our existing customers  and the inclusion of the operations of pentasafe and marshal from december onwards 
service revenue increased in absolute terms due to the compounding effect of our base of installed licenses  a significant majority of our customers renewing their maintenance service agreements and increases in revenue from our hosted web analytics service 
service revenue grew more rapidly in fiscal over  than in fiscal over due to the inclusion in fiscal of the existing service agreements from pentasafe and marshal compared to the overall slower license revenue growth in fiscal we expect our service revenue to continue to grow as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal as the license revenue from microsoft ceased in august  our installed base increases  and existing customers renew maintenance contracts 
total cost of revenue 
total cost of revenue and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except percentages cost of software license revenue as percentage of license revenue cost of service revenue as percentage of service revenue amortization of purchased technology impairment of purchased technology total cost of revenue as percentage of total revenue total cost of revenue decreased by million or from fiscal to and increased by million or  from fiscal to cost of software license revenue 
cost of software license revenue includes royalties paid to third parties personnel costs and costs associated with software packaging  documentation such as user manuals and cds  and 
table of contents production  as well as shipping 
cost of software license revenue as a percentage of related license revenue increased from during fiscal and during fiscal to during fiscal the increase primarily is due to the decline in revenue from microsoft  which did not have any costs associated with it and to increases in royalty expense and fulfillment costs from fiscal to fiscal cost of software license revenue decreased by  from fiscal to fiscal due to a net decrease in royalty expense as a result of our acquisition of technology that was previously subject to a royalty agreement 
although the purchased technology is being amortized  other technology became fully amortized during the period as an offset 
we expect cost of software license revenue to decrease as revenue associated with purchased technology increases while amortization of the cost remains fixed 
we also expect to realize increased costs savings associated with the broader implementation of electronic software delivery which was completed in the fourth quarter of  which significantly reduces the need for packaging and delivery 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of personnel costs and expenses incurred in providing telephonic support  on site consulting services  training services  and costs associated with our hosted service 
cost of service revenue as a percentage of related service revenue decreased from during fiscal to during fiscal and to during fiscal the improvement in our services gross margin in fiscal and fiscal is primarily attributable to greater efficiencies in providing technical support services and to increased maintenance revenue as a significant majority of our customers renewed their maintenance agreements 
we expect service revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our installed license base grows and  as a consequence  our cost of service revenue to increase in absolute dollars 
we also intend to increase the number of consulting service employees and to sell additional services to better enable our customers to take greater advantage of the new features and functionality of our products 
amortization and impairment of purchased technology 
purchased technology consists of developed software capitalized in our acquisitions and is amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  generally three years 
amortization increased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal due to additional amounts capitalized in acquisitions and decreased to million during fiscal due to amounts capitalized in prior acquisitions becoming fully amortized 
additionally  we recorded a charge of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to discontinuance of the vigilent user manager technology purchased as part of the pentasafe acquisition 
we expect to amortize approximately million of purchased technology during fiscal  absent further acquisitions or impairments 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including salaries and employee commissions  and expenses relating to travel  advertising  public relations  seminars  marketing programs  trade shows  lead generation activities and proportionately allocated facilities and information technology costs  net of payments from microsoft for product promotions 
sales and marketing expenses and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except percentages and headcount sales and marketing expenses percentage change from previous year as a percentage of total revenue headcount at june sales and marketing expense decreased by million or  from fiscal to the decrease in absolute dollars resulted principally from our lower revenue during the current period  resulting in the payment 
table of contents of lower commissions and bonuses  combined with our implementation of cost savings measures 
sales and marketing expense increased by million or  from fiscal to the increase in absolute dollars resulted principally from our acquisitions of pentasafe and marshal during fiscal  and from hiring additional field sales and support  inside sales and marketing personnel  expanding our sales infrastructure  increasing the number of third party channel partners  and higher sales commissions 
sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal from and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the percentages was principally the result of the reduction of revenue from microsoft in each fiscal year  which revenue did not require significant sales or marketing expenditures 
during fiscal  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase and to remain at about the same percentage of total revenue as in fiscal research and development 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  consulting fees  depreciation and proportionately allocated facilities and information technology costs 
to date  we have expensed all research and development costs as incurred in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  as technological feasibility is established at the time our software development process is completed 
research and development expenses and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except percentages and headcount research and development percentage change from previous year as a percentage of total revenue headcount at june research and development expenses decreased by million or from fiscal to this decrease in absolute dollars resulted principally from lower overall headcount and payment of lower bonuses partially offset by the effect of annual base salary increases that took place in november research and development expense increased million from fiscal to or 
this increase resulted principally from increases in headcount  including personnel from our acquisitions of pentasafe and marshal 
our strategy since signing the license agreement with microsoft in september was to increase spending in research and development through fiscal as a result  we have brought to market a number of new products 
during fiscal  we expect research and development expenses to remain relatively unchanged from spending levels reported in fiscal resulting in a small decrease as a percentage of total revenue as total revenue is expected to increase from fiscal over the consolidation of research and development for security management products in fiscal  together with the release of major updates for the large majority of our products in fiscal is expected to allow us to focus a greater number of existing personnel on new product areas 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance and administration  as well as directors and officers insurance  professional services expenses  such as legal and accounting fees  and proportionately allocated facilities and information technology costs 
general and administrative expense and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except percentages and headcount general and administrative percentage increase from previous year as a percentage of total revenue headcount at june 
table of contents general and administrative expenses increased by million and million  or and  from fiscal to and from fiscal to  respectively 
the increase in fiscal is primarily due to an increase in legal expense  additional costs associated with sarbanes oxley legislation compliance  increased premiums associated with directors and officers insurance  increased fees paid to board members and an overall increase in other professional fees required to manage and support our business 
in fiscal  we also incurred higher legal expense than in fiscal  as well as higher premiums for directors and officers insurance 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses included million associated with a warrant issued to an executive search firm in march for recruiting services in connection with recruiting our chief executive officer 
during fiscal  we expect our general and administrative expenses to remain at approximately the same absolute spending levels as reported in fiscal employee stock based compensation 
deferred employee stock based compensation represents the intrinsic value of unvested options assumed in acquisitions and the charges associated with the grant of options at less than fair market value 
the deferred amount is being amortized over the vesting periods of the assumed and granted options  generally four years 
during fiscal  and  we recognized employee stock based compensation expense of   and million  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal and is due to the decrease in amortization of deferred employee stock based compensation related to the assumption of webtrends options  which has decreased over time in accordance with the vesting periods 
during fiscal  we expect to amortize approximately million of deferred employee stock based compensation 
amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets includes amortization of capitalized values relating to customer contracts  customer lists  patents  and trade name intangibles from our acquisitions 
other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life  generally three years 
amortization decreased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal and to million during fiscal the decrease in the amortization during fiscal and fiscal resulted from the full amortization of amounts capitalized in previous acquisitions  partially offset by intangible assets capitalized in connection with our acquisitions in december and march and april of during fiscal  we expect to amortize approximately million of other intangible assets  absent further acquisitions 
impairment and amortization of goodwill 
during fiscal we amortized million of goodwill recognized in our acquisitions 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on july  and accordingly stopped amortizing goodwill on that date 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded a one time  non cash transitional impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill from previous acquisitions 
the charge is reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
there was no income tax effect resulting from the change in accounting principle 
we conducted our first annual review for impairment of goodwill as of april  and recorded a non cash charge of million 
the impairment charge is attributable to our revised forecast for operating profits and cash flows 
revenue for the three months ended september  was significantly lower than we anticipated 
because a significant portion of our revenues historically has been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter  the actual drop off in revenue compared with plan was not evident until the end of the quarter 
accordingly  as of september  we reduced our forecasted future operating profits and cash flows 
this significant change in estimated future results required us to perform an interim review of goodwill for impairment  as prescribed by sfas no 
this resulted in a further non cash impairment charge of million during the three months ended september  we completed our annual test of impairment as of april  and noted no further impairment 

table of contents in assessing the carrying amount of goodwill as of july   april   september  and april  the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using a combination of the discounted cash flows and comparable transactions methodologies 
write off of acquired in process research and development costs 
during fiscal and we expensed  and million  respectively  for in process research and development costs related to acquisitions 
these values were established by applying the income approach  which considers the present value of the projected free cash flows expected to be generated by the products 
these costs were charged to operations at the date of the acquisition as the uncompleted development projects had not reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses at those dates 
no such charges were recorded during fiscal restructuring charge 
during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to an effort to enhance our customers experience with netiq products and services  to create a more efficient business structure and to better enable collaboration between key functions 
during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to a plan to terminate employment of employees and vacate certain of our facilities that will no longer be used due to resizing the combined business after the acquisition of pentasafe 
no such charge was recorded during fiscal the million charge in fiscal was offset by a recovery of  related to the expected recovery of personnel and facility reserves related to the fiscal restructuring charge 
total other income  net interest income foreign exchange gains losses impairment of long term investment other income expense total for fiscal  and  total other income  net was  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest income is primarily the result of lower interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  due to the continuing decline in the yield on new investments as earlier investments mature  as well as lower cash and investment balances due to our use of cash 
foreign exchange gains and losses have fluctuated as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates affecting the remeasurement of us dollar denominated monetary accounts held in foreign subsidiaries with local functional currencies  particularly euro 
impairments of long term investments included in fiscal a charge of million from a write down of an investment and in fiscal a charge of million resulting from a write down of an investment in an affiliate  based on management s assessments that the declines in value were other than temporary 
income taxes 
we recorded income tax expense of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in income tax expense in fiscal compared to is primarily due to an increase in foreign taxes payable 
the decrease in the income tax expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is a result of the decrease in taxable income and a reduction in our effective tax rate from during fiscal to in fiscal the tax benefit associated with dispositions from employee stock plans reduced federal and certain state income taxes payable other than federal alternative minimum tax to zero  in fiscal  and recent accounting pronouncements in december  the emerging issue task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
in some 
table of contents arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  in january  and a revised interpretation of fin no 
fin r in december fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the adoption of fin no 
r did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as we have no variable interest entities 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of sfas no 
on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
in particular  this statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative 
it also clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which requires that certain financial instruments be presented as liabilities that were previously presented as equity or as temporary equity

in november  the eitf reached an interim consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  to require additional disclosure requirements for securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity for fiscal years ending after december  those additional disclosures have been incorporated into the accompanying footnotes 
in march  the eitf reached a final consensus on this issue to provide additional guidance which companies must follow in determining whether investment securities have an impairment which should be considered other than temporary 
the guidance is applicable for reporting periods beginning after june  the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments  for a total of million compared to a total of million as of june  a decrease of million 
the primary reasons for the decline during fiscal were the use of approximately 
table of contents million in our stock repurchase program  net of proceeds from the sale of common stock  and the use of million in investing activities 
these uses were partially offset by million of cash flows provided by operations 
cash flows from operations have been positive in each year presented even though we have sustained net losses as reflected on the statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
net losses of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  have been largely the result of non cash charges relating to depreciation and amortization and impairments of goodwill and long term investments 
depreciation and amortization represents depreciation and amortization of costs related to physical assets such as our headquarters building  leasehold improvements in leased facilities and computer and other equipment  as well as amortization of goodwill in fiscal and amortization of purchased technology and other intangible assets in each of the three fiscal years presented 
amortization of goodwill in fiscal was million 
upon the adoption of sfas effective july   we ceased amortization of goodwill and recorded a transitional impairment of million reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in fiscal and  we recorded additional impairments of goodwill of million and million  respectively  as we re evaluated our business prospects and future cash flows 
goodwill remaining on the balance sheet at june  was million 
our investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the principal uses of cash during fiscal were the acquisition of product and technology previously licensed and the acquisition of a small business for a combined amount of million 
other principal uses of cash during fiscal  and  were acquisitions of property and equipment of million  million and million  respectively 
the larger amounts spent in fiscal and included purchases related to major new programs for sales force automation and enterprise resource planning 
cash outflows also included purchases of short term investments of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  and long term investments of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the principal sources of cash from investing activities during fiscal  and were proceeds from the sales and maturities of short term investments of million  million and million  respectively 
our financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  and a net cash inflow of million in fiscal during and  we used cash of million and million to repurchase our common stock in open market transactions 
in september our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common stock in open market transactions during the succeeding months 
sources of cash during these periods were principally from exercises of stock options and issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
long term obligations and commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of june  and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands  including lease payments accrued as part of our restructuring liability  facility reserve  and goodwill payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases future minimum royalty payments total long term obligations and commitments also  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long term obligations 

table of contents we believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances  short term investments  and cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements  or for other purposes  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financings or from other sources  however  we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
we have no current plans  agreements  or commitments  and are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect to such material or significant transactions 
employee stock options our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests 
we consider our option program critical to our operation and productivity and substantially all of our employees participate in our option program 
during fiscal  of the options granted  were granted to employees other than our five mostly highly compensated executive officers 
options granted under the plans expire no later than years from the grant date and generally vest within years 
since august  employee options granted were for a term of not more than seven years 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan under which employees are entitled to purchase a limited number of shares at of fair market value

warrant not approved by stockholders 
in march we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to an executive search firm in connection with the search for our chief executive officer 
the warrant was immediately vested and exercisable 
the warrant was valued at million using the black scholes pricing model with the following assumptions contractual life of months  risk free interest rate of  volatility of  and no dividends paid during the contractual term 
the fair value of the warrant was expensed in march and is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
no shares were issued pursuant to the warrant and the warrant expired unexercised on july factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant also may impair our business operations 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may not be able to achieve or sustain the revenue growth rates sufficient to achieve targeted operating profit levels 
in fiscal  our total revenue  which consists of software license revenue and services revenue  declined compared to fiscal revenue 
software license revenue in fiscal was lower than in fiscal although services revenue increased by in compared to  the percentage increase was less than the growth in services revenue in compared to 
table of contents in part  the decrease in total revenue and software license revenue is attributable to the scheduled decline in license payments made to us under our september agreement with microsoft to license our operations manager technology 
the agreement provided for a total license fee of million to be paid in installments during fiscal  and the size of the installment payments made under the agreement decreased starting in the second quarter of fiscal and the final payment was made by microsoft in august to date  we have not fully replaced the revenue from microsoft with other revenue sources 
in addition  our non microsoft revenue declined by in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
we may not be able to sustain or increase our revenue in future periods due to one or more of the factors discussed in the next risk factor 
in particular  continued weakness in it spending  increased competition and pricing pressures could contribute to such a result 
we expect our revenue to fluctuate for a number of reasons  and therefore it is difficult to predict our future operating results 
our revenue and operating results have varied substantially from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including general economic conditions and the discretionary nature of our customers purchasing practices  it budgets and budget cycles  the timing of new product introductions or enhancements by us  our competitors and our platform vendors  which may result in purchase deferrals by our customers in anticipation of new products  competitive conditions in our industry  including new products  product announcements and special pricing offered by our competitors  our ability to introduce new products and enhancements and the timing of their release  our ability to complete specific sales transactions in a given quarter or fiscal year  fluctuation in the number and size of orders in a quarter  and our ability to recognize revenues from the fees we charge to our customers 
we have experienced seasonality in our license bookings  with the second and fourth quarter of our fiscal year typically having the largest volume in new license bookings 
we believe that this seasonality results from the budgeting  procurement and work cycles of our customers  and from the structure of our direct sales incentive and compensation program 
we expect this seasonality to continue in the future 
in addition  the effect of quarterly fluctuations relative to our expectations is increased by the fact that a significant portion of our revenues has historically been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter  with a substantial portion of sales occurring in the last week and on the last day of the fiscal quarter 
our reliance on a large portion of revenue occurring at the end of the quarter results in uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues  and our forecasts may not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us 
we may not learn of shortfalls in revenue or earnings until late in a particular quarter  leaving us unable to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter 
these factors increase the chances that our results could diverge from the expectations of investors and securities analysts 
given the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter financial comparisons may not necessarily be meaningful  and should not be relied upon as single indicators of our future operating results and performance 

table of contents our investments in products and companies  including through internal development and acquisition  present many risks  and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of the investment 
we have made substantial investments in developing and acquiring new products  services and technologies  and have made investments in  and acquisitions of  other companies 
we intend to continue to make investments in products  services and technologies  and may in the future acquire or make investments in companies we perceive to be complementary or to have synergies with our business 
the risks we may encounter in connection with such investments include the investment may not further our business strategy  we may pay more than the investment proves to be worth  the technology may not be feasible or may fail to be popular with customers  or economic conditions may change  all of which may diminish the value of the investment to us  we may fail to anticipate new technology development  customer requirements or industry standards  or may be unable to develop or purchase new products  services and technologies that adequately address these developments  requirements or standards in a timely manner  we may have difficulty integrating the investment with our business  marketing and sales strategies  we may have difficulty integrating any acquired technologies  operations or personnel into our existing business and product lines  and our ongoing business may be disrupted by transition or integration issues arising from the investment 
the failure of our investments to produce anticipated benefits may also adversely affect our operating results  as a consequence of amortization of purchased technology and other intangible assets  other acquisition or investment related charges  and impairment charges associated with goodwill 
during fiscal  we amortized million of goodwill related to our acquisitions and in accordance with sfas no 
had no goodwill amortization in fiscal and we may be required to record charges for impairment if a product or technology is discontinued  if we pay more than an investment is worth  or if an investment subsequently declines in value 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 on july   we recorded a transitional impairment charge of million and have subsequently recorded impairment charges of million on april   and million on september  these impairment charges are attributable to our revised forecasts for future operating profits and cash flows from our investments  and reflect the decline in our market capitalization 
if in future periods we discontinue additional products  or determine that our remaining goodwill from acquisitions has become further impaired or that our investments have further declined in value  we will be required to record additional charges 
goodwill as of june  was million 
the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our immediate operating results and financial condition 
to the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock  such as options  the stock holdings of existing stockholders will be diluted and earnings per share may decrease 
to the extent we pay cash for future investments or acquisitions our cash reserves will be further reduced and interest income may decline 
we expect to face increasing competition in the future  which could result in loss of market share  decreased prices  reduced gross margins and diminished profits 
the market for systems and security management software solutions and our web analytics software solutions is intensely competitive  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
while there are few substantial barriers to entry at the low end  we expect to see increasing consolidation in the software industry  including among our competitors  which could increase the resources available to our competitors and the scope of their product offerings 
our competitors and potential competitors may have more name and brand recognition  develop more advanced technology  undertake more extensive sales and marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and sales terms  and be able to leverage more extensive financial  customer and partner resources 

table of contents we also expect future product consolidation to be an important competitive factor  and that competitors may bundle their products with products similar to ours  or incorporate functionality into existing products that could render certain of our products unmarketable or obsolete 
for instance  microsoft is a competitor for certain of our products and has an established business practice of adding functionality to new versions of windows in ways that can impair the success of formerly complementary products 
customer perception of this pattern could also adversely affect or delay sales of our products 
in addition  our ability to sell our products depends  in part  on the compatibility of our products with other third party products  such as operating systems and messaging  internet and database applications 
some of these third party software developers may change their products so that they compete with our products or are no longer compatible with our products 
in particular  our business continues to be largely focused on the microsoft windows environment and microsoft has typically provided to us pre release notification of feature enhancements to its products and necessary development tools and information 
if microsoft stops this practice  we may be unable to coordinate our product offerings with microsoft or to otherwise capitalize on new microsoft product releases and feature enhancements 
our inability to rapidly respond to changes in our revenue and to adopt appropriate expense levels may result in operating continued losses or a shortfall in operating profits 
as a consequence of our acquisitions and in response to the changing business environment  we have adopted a number of measures to better align our expenses with anticipated revenues  including various reductions in force and the closure of several facilities 
in addition  at the beginning of fiscal  we re aligned our sales force from a territory orientation to a named account orientation to better focus on our existing customer base  and we realigned our products into solution sets 
the focus on specific customers and product solution sets  together with our recent implementation of a value based sales approach  was intended to enable us to meet customer needs more quickly and achieve more cost effective sales operations 
however  these measures have not been wholly successful 
we believe that the disruption caused by our sales realignment significantly contributed to increased turnover of personnel and reduced sales force productivity in fiscal we base our operating expenses on our expectations regarding future revenues 
however  because most of our revenue is generated at the end of the quarter  we may not learn of shortfalls in revenue or earnings until late in a particular quarter  leaving us unable to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter 
as a consequence  we may experience an operating loss  a shortfall in our operating profit or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations 
in april we announced a restructuring of our business  consolidating our security management development activities in houston 
we adopted a plan to eliminate redundant positions in both the new zealand and the us workforces and to vacate excess facilities  and terminated the employment of employees and vacated certain of our leased facilities 
to better align our internal information systems with our business units we also reorganized our it department 
in april  we announced a reduction in force designed to lower operating costs and to better support the convergence of the systems management and security management markets  by combining our systems and security business units and streamlining our organizational structure 
to the extent we engage in these and other organizational or operational changes in the future  we may incur additional costs and expenses and suffer lost revenue 
these measures  and any future steps we may adopt  may result in distraction of management  operational disruption or negative impact on customer service and satisfaction 
similarly  other organizational or operational changes in the future may not result in the intended operational improvements and cost reductions  and may adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we have a history of losses and may experience losses in the future 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses 
during fiscal  and  we reported net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
these losses principally resulted 
table of contents from amortization and impairment of goodwill  amortization of purchased technology and other intangible assets  and other acquisition related charges 
during fiscal year we expect amortization of purchased technology and other intangible assets to be million 
we could incur additional impairment charges in future periods 
errors in our products could result in significant costs to us and could impair our ability to sell our products 
because our software products are complex  they may contain errors  or bugs  that could be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
these errors could materially and adversely affect our business reputation  result in significant costs to us  and impair our ability to sell our products in the future 
the costs incurred in correcting any product errors may be substantial and could decrease our profit margins 
while we expect to continually test our products for errors and work with customers through our customer support services organization to identify and correct bugs  errors in our products may be found in the future 
because it is difficult to simulate the highly complex computing environments in which our customers use our products and because of the increasing functionality of our product offerings  testing may be complicated and fail to identify all errors 
moreover  because our products support and interoperate with third party operating systems and applications  any errors or bugs in that software may result in errors in the performance of our products and may require cooperation from the third party to resolve 
detection of any significant errors may result in  among other things  lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  and increased service and warranty costs 
errors in our software may also result in expensive and time consuming litigation  and the potential award of substantial damages 
while our software license agreements typically contain limitations and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages resulting from errors in our software  there is no assurance that such limitations and disclaimers will be enforced by a court or other tribunal or will otherwise effectively protect us from such claims 
this is particularly true with respect to those of our products licensed under shrink wrap or clickwrap license agreements that are not signed by licensees  but also may apply to negotiated license agreements 
we presently carry errors and omissions insurance against such claims  but there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any losses as a result of bugs or errors or will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
our business requires the creation of technology and the effective protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights in that technology 
our success is heavily dependent on our ability to create proprietary technology and to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in that technology  as well as our ability to defend against adverse claims of third parties with respect to our technology and intellectual property 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights in our products and services 
these laws and procedures provide only limited protection 
we presently have issued or allowed patents in the united states  pending patent applications in the united states  issued or allowed foreign patents  and pending patent applications in certain foreign jurisdictions 
however  these patents may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers 
in addition  despite precautions that we take  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our current or future products or to independently develop similar or superior technology or design around the patents we own 
policing unauthorized use and transfer of our software is difficult and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in licensing our products  other than in enterprise license transactions  we typically rely on shrink wrap or clickwrap licenses that are not signed by licensees 
such licenses may be unenforceable  in whole or in part  under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
it may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights through the process of litigation  arbitration or other adversarial proceedings 
such proceedings could be costly and potentially distracting to management  and there is no assurance that we would be successful in such proceeding 

table of contents third parties could assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their intellectual property rights  and these claims  whether they have merit or not  could harm our business by increasing our costs  reducing our revenue or by creating customer concerns that result in reduced sales 
this is particularly true in the patent area  as an increasing number of us patents covering computer software have been issued during the past few years 
patent owners may claim that one or more of our products infringes a patent held by the claimant 
for example  in january  one of our competitors  bmc software  inc  initiated a lawsuit alleging that one or more of our products infringed a bmc patent 
these claims were subsequently submitted to arbitration 
although we believe these claims to be without merit  claims such as these could affect our relationships with existing customers and may discourage future customers from purchasing our products 
the intensely competitive nature of our industry and the importance of technology to our competitors businesses may enhance the likelihood of being subject to third party claims of this nature 
any such claims  even if without merit  could be time consuming  result in potentially significant litigation costs or damages  cause product shipment delays and require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 
such claims could also force us either to stop selling  incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the allegedly infringing intellectual property or to redesign those products or services that incorporate such technology 
we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows  the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps  and the number of issued software patents increases 
we face challenges in the retention of key management  technical and sales personnel 
we depend on certain key management  technical and sales personnel and on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
given recent competitive pressures  we anticipate that our ability to retain key personnel will become more difficult should the economy improve and make more positions available  thus enhancing employee mobility 
as well  our ability to attract and retain personnel may be made more difficult by anticipated changes in the accounting treatment of stock based compensation  which may limit our ability to use broad based stock option grants as a means to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the volatility or lack of improvement in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel  who may expect to realize value from our stock options 
our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain the services of our key personnel 
we do not have employment contracts for a defined term with our employees  including our key personnel 
if we lose the services of one or more of our key personnel  including if one or more of our key employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could harm our business and affect our ability to successfully implement our business objectives 
failure to improve our business processes and infrastructure  and satisfactorily implement new information and fulfillment systems  may adversely affect our business 
our prior growth  including through acquisitions  as well as recent business and regulatory requirements  has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for our management personnel  a need to upgrade our operational  financial  and management information systems  and the need to develop and implement cost effective systems  standards  controls  procedures and policies  including documentation of the internal controls procedures required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of in particular  we have been required to improve our accounting and financial reporting systems in order to accommodate our growth on a global basis and to meet the requirements of a changing regulatory environment 
we are continuing the process of modifying and refining our customer relationship management system and enterprise resource planning system to better meet our needs and to provide the enhanced reporting required by increased competitive pressures and regulatory requirements 
most recently  we have implemented eservices technology that provides self service support capabilities to our customers as well as electronic fulfillment systems that reduce the cost and time required to fulfill customer orders 
the failure  poor performance or errors of any of these systems 
table of contents could impact our ability to sell and deliver our products or could result in our inability to maintain our internal controls to the standards required by applicable law  any of which could in turn materially and adversely impact our business  including our ability to meet our revenue and expense targets 
we rely on our network and data center infrastructure for internal communications  communications with customers and partners  direct sales of our software products  sales lead generation and direct provision of fee based services 
that infrastructure and our other facilities are vulnerable to damage from human error  physical or electronic security breaches  power loss and other utility failures  fire  earthquake  flood  sabotage  vandalism and similar events 
in addition  continued attempts to exploit security vulnerabilities in infrastructure products pose a threat to the stability of our it infrastructure 
despite precautions  a natural disaster or other incident could result in interruptions in our service or significant damage  and affect our provision of services and fulfillment of product orders  our ability to process product orders and invoices  and our ability otherwise to timely conduct our business operations 
our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial and increasing portion of our revenues from customers outside the united states and are continuing to expand our international operations 
we have support and administrative services operations in galway  ireland  tokyo  japan and staines  united kingdom  as well as a number of other foreign locations  to provide sales and sales support 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including the overlap of different tax regimes  the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices  differing regulatory and legal requirements and employment schemes  including with respect to separation and redundancies  and our ability to identify and timely comply with such requirements and schemes  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries  the need to localize and internationalize our products and licensing programs  significant reliance on our distributors and other resellers who do not offer our products exclusively  import and export licensing requirements  including export controls on encryption technology  political and economic instability in some countries  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other regions  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  and increased travel and infrastructure costs associated with multiple international locations 
to date  a substantial portion of our sales have been denominated in us dollars  and we have not used risk management techniques or hedged the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in fiscal we recorded a loss of approximately  and in fiscal we recorded a gain of million resulting principally from the remeasurement of us dollar denominated monetary accounts held in subsidiaries with local functional currencies  in particular euro 
in the future  if we do not engage in hedging these balances or otherwise reduce our exposure to the remeasurement of us dollar denominated assets  our results of operations could be subject to further fluctuations 
in addition  to the extent that we continue to sell and pay expenses in foreign currencies  the us dollar values reported in revenue and expenses could vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our global operations  especially those outside of the united states  also subject us to laws relating to the use and transfer of personally identifiable information about our customers  employees and other individuals 

table of contents violation of these laws  which in many cases apply not only to third party transfers  but also to transfers of information between our subsidiaries and ourselves  and between and among ourselves  our subsidiaries and our commercial partners  could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity 
we are increasingly relying on indirect distribution channels to generate revenue 
to further increase our revenues  we have increasingly relied on indirect distribution channels as a means of growing product sales  including with respect to international sales 
these relationships  both domestically and internationally  are typically non exclusive and can be terminated upon short notice 
this strategy presents a number of risks and uncertainties including the ability of resellers or integrators to cease marketing or integrating our products with little or no notice  the ability of our resellers or integrators to market or use competitive products or services from third parties and to promote such third party products or services in preference to ours  the effectiveness of our resellers and integrators in marketing our products  the difficulty in attracting and replacing high quality resellers and integrators  the potential for conflicts between our direct and indirect sales channels resulting in lost sales and customer confusion or dissatisfaction  and risk associated with accurately reporting revenue arising from these indirect distribution channels

kahan  senior vice president of marketing  resigned on december   and was replaced by olivier j 
thierry  who was promoted to senior vice president  worldwide marketing and alliances on january  our success will depend to a certain extent on our ability to assimilate these changes in our leadership team 
we incorporate software licensed from third parties into some of our products and any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could reduce the demand for  or prevent the sale or use of  our products 
certain of our software products contain components developed and maintained by commercial third party software vendors or available through the open source software community 
we also expect that we may incorporate software from commercial third party vendors and open source software in our future products 
software obtained from commercial third party vendors is typically made available for a specific term  with no guaranty of renewal 
our business would be disrupted if this software  or functional equivalents of this software  were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in either case  we would be required to either redesign our software to function with alternate third party software or open source software  or develop these components ourselves  which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in our software shipments 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future software offerings 
we presently are developing products for use on the linux platform 
the sco group sco has filed and threatened to file lawsuits against companies that operate linux for commercial 
table of contents purposes  alleging that such use of linux infringes sco s intellectual property rights 
the threat of such litigation and the cost of the licensing scheme presently proposed by sco may adversely affect the demand for the linux platform and  consequently  the sales of our linux based products 
changes in accounting regulations could negatively affect market perception of our results and the way we do business 
the accounting rules applicable to our business have undergone significant changes in recent years  and future changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to expensing of employee stock options  could cause us to account for our business in ways that may adversely affect our operating results and investor perception of those results 
as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  currently we apply accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock based compensation 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recognized for options granted to employees where the exercise price equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
a change in accounting rules that would require us to change the way we account for such options to include a deferred compensation liability on our balance sheet and to include the deemed expense associated with such options in our statement of operations may  if adopted  reduce our operating income or increase operating losses as a result of these non cash expenses 
in such an event  investor perception of our results of operations may be adversely affected and our stock price may fall 
changes in our market may affect our operating results by changing the manner in which we are required to account for sales 
there have been various changes in the enterprise software market that may affect the manner in which we do business 
we currently sell most of our software licenses on a perpetual basis  which enables us to recognize the majority of revenue received in connection with the sale promptly upon consummation of the sale 
however  certain software vendors are moving towards a subscription based model in which periodic fees are charged for use of the software 
if customers increasingly demand that we sell licenses to our software on a subscription basis  or otherwise charge a periodic fee for its use  it will delay our recognition of revenue for that sale and will decrease the revenues attributable to such sales during the reporting period in which the sale is made although the deferred revenue will be recognized in subsequent periods 
if substantial portions of our license sales are converted to a subscription basis  this could materially affect our revenues during the initial quarters in which the change is implemented 
we have various mechanisms in place that may discourage takeover attempts 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of delaware law could delay or make difficult a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock that may have rights preferences and privileges superior to our common stock without any action by our stockholders 
our bylaws limit the ability of a stockholder to call a special meeting 
we have a classified board of directors  with staggered  three year terms  that may lengthen the time required to gain control of the board of directors 
in addition  certain of our officers are parties to a change of control agreement or other agreements with us that provide for the acceleration of stock option vesting and the payment of certain compensation in the event such officer s employment is terminated within a specified period after a change of control 
in addition  our and stock plans provide for acceleration of stock option vesting in the event an employee s employment is terminated within a specified period after a change of control 
any of these provisions could dissuade a potential acquirer from seeking to acquire control of netiq  which in turn could result in our stockholders not being able to participate in premiums that may otherwise have been offered in a potential acquisition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts  and accounts payable 
we consider investments in highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments  thus  fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
our business is transacted principally in us dollars 
during the nine months ended june   of the total amount of our invoices was in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to local currency denominated revenue and operating expenses in australia  belgium  canada  denmark  france  germany  ireland  italy  japan  new zealand  singapore  south korea  spain  sweden  switzerland  and the united kingdom 
we believe that a natural hedge exists in some local currencies  as local currency denominated revenue offsets some of the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
however  as of june   we had no hedging contracts outstanding 
at june  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
based on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at june  a change in interest rates would change our annual interest income and cash flows by approximately
