item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and ciena s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview in early  the telecommunications industry began a severe decline  and our dominant historical customer base  communications carriers  responded by curtailing network build outs and reducing their overall capital expenses 
as a result  the market for our core networking products and our revenue declined sharply 
while we expect that most major carriers will hold their aggregate capital spending flat for the next several years  we believe that communications service providers  cable operators  governments and enterprises will make significant investments in next generation equipment  particularly equipment that resides at the edge of communications networks and enables the creation and delivery of new high bandwidth data services 
during the past three years  we have undertaken a number of significant efforts to position ciena to realize these market opportunities and leverage our historical focus and expertise in core networking 
through acquisitions  strategic relationships with equipment suppliers and internal development  we have sought to expand our addressable market  diversify our customer base and broaden our networking solutions portfolio 
during fiscal  we acquired oni systems corp  which provided our customers with a broader and more comprehensive set of optical transport and access products for metropolitan networks and enterprises 
through our acquisitions of wavesmith networks and akara corporation during fiscal  we bolstered our presence in the telco and enterprise markets and added multi service switching and extended storage solutions 
in may  we completed our acquisitions of catena networks and internet photonics 
through the catena acquisition  we added broadband access solutions that enable the delivery of traditional plain old telephone service pots  dsl  video services  and voip from a single  integrated platform 
through the internet photonics acquisition  we added carrier grade optical ethernet transport and switching solutions for deployment of ethernet private line services by cable operators and carriers 
we believe the broadband access market is positioned to benefit as service providers shift spending to target the access portions of their networks to enable increased residential access to high bandwidth services such as dsl  video on demand and hdtv 
we have taken steps to expand our sales channels beyond direct sales to service providers  developing a growing number of distribution arrangements and other strategic relationships that target enterprise and government customers 
one of the results of the expansion of our product portfolio and increase in our sales channels has been the diversification of our customer base 
during fiscal  at t and sprint each represented more than of ciena s total revenue 
during fiscal  at t and qwest each represented more than of ciena s total revenue 
during fiscal  saic was the only customer that represented more than of ciena s total revenue 
we are focused on reducing our ongoing operating expenses and realigning our resources to better reflect our market opportunities and changing product mix 
as part of this strategy we have reduced staff from  employed on october  to  employed on october  to  employed as of october  to  employed as october  and closed several facilities  including the closure of our san jose  california facility on september  while our operating expenses have fluctuated due to acquisitions  restructuring and asset impairments  we have taken significant steps to reduce on going operating expenses 
consistent with our overall strategy  we plan to continue to seek a reduction in operating expenses in fiscal  in order to strike an appropriate balance between ongoing strategic investment in our business  careful expense control and prudent cash management 
during  we reorganized the internal structure of our sales and engineering functions to better align these operations with our expanded product portfolio and to better support our new markets 
we reorganized our operations effective as of the second quarter of fiscal into multiple operating segments for the purpose of making operating decisions and assessing performance 
those operating segments were the following core networking group cng  metro and enterprise solutions group mesg  data networking group dng  and global network services gns 
during the third quarter of fiscal the broadband access group bbg was organized from the operations of catena 
in october  in order improve operational efficiencies  operating decisions and assess performance  we combined the operations of cng and mesg and formed the transport and switching group tsg 
the decline and shift in our customers spending patterns  and our efforts to reposition ciena  including the acquisitions we made  have had a number of significant effects on our business during the last three fiscal years including the following we have begun to see results of our efforts to expand and diversify our products  markets and customer base 
the percentage of revenue from transport and switching products declined from in fiscal to in fiscal to in fiscal the percentage of revenue from data networking products and broadband access products increased from in fiscal to in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of our acquisitions we have incurred charges for in process research and development of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and have also incurred intangible asset amortization expense of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
the sharp decline in demand for our long distance optical transport equipment products caused us to incur million of costs related to obsolete inventory and excess purchase commitments during fiscal the need to reduce the size of our operations  in response to the shrinking demand for our products  caused us to incur restructuring charges of million  million  and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as a result of the decline in the forecasted demand for our products  along with the reduction in valuations of comparable businesses  we incurred goodwill impairments of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as a result of this decline we also incurred long lived asset impairments of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal respectively 
uncertainties relating to our customers financial conditions resulted in charges of bad debt expense of million in fiscal  the recovery of doubtful accounts of million in fiscal and the recovery of sale  export  use tax liabilities and payments of million in fiscal we made several investments in privately held technology companies 
the decline in the value of these investments resulted in the loss of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
as a result of net losses during fiscal and projected future net losses  ciena recorded a net income tax charge of million to establish a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
ciena s net losses of  million  million and million  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  were primarily attributable to the factors listed above 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenue  cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  training costs  royalties  license fees  direct technical support costs  cost of excess and obsolete inventory and overhead related to manufacturing  technical support and engineering  furnishing and installation operations

in fiscal  million and million of the recorded ipr d were from our akara and wavesmith acquisitions  respectively 
in fiscal we recorded million and million of ipr d from our catena and internet photonics acquisitions  respectively 
restructuring costs increased from fiscal to fiscal due to additional workforce reductions and excess facility charges largely related to the closure of our san jose  ca facility 
the charges that resulted from these actions were taken as part of an effort to reduce our fixed operating costs 
goodwill impairment increased from fiscal to fiscal due to the decline in the forecasted demand for our products  along with the reduction in valuations of comparable businesses  which implied that the fair value of three reporting units was below their carrying value

long lived assets impairment charges for fiscal were million of impaired research and development equipment  which was classified as held for sale 
these charges in fiscal were largely attributable to the closure of our san jose  ca facility

our operating activities consumed net cash of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal respectively 
cash used in operating activities during fiscal was primarily attributable to the net loss  offset by non cash charges related to goodwill impairment  amortization of other intangibles  deferred stock compensation and debt issuance costs  the non cash portion of restructuring charges  depreciation expense  provision for inventory excess and obsolescence  a decrease in deferred income tax asset and a decrease in accounts receivable

contractual obligations the following is a summary of our future minimum payments under contractual obligations as of october  in thousands less than one to three to total one year three years five years thereafter convertible notes operating leases purchase obligations total the terms of our convertible notes with a principal value of million include interest at payable on a semi annual basis on february and august of each year  the notes are due february  purchase commitments related to amounts we are obligated to pay to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for inventory 
some of our commercial commitments  including some of the future minimum payments set forth above  are secured by standby letters of credit 
the following is a summary of our commercial commitments secured by standby letters of credit by commitment expiration date as of october  in thousands less than one to three to total one year three years five years thereafter standby letters of credit off balance sheet arrangements ciena does not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  we do not have any interest in so called limited purpose entities  which include special purpose entities spes and structured finance entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires ciena to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
ciena bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assts and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
during fiscal  re evaluation of certain estimates led to the effects described below 
revenue recognition ciena s products and services include hardware  software  and professional services 
ciena recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
the third and fourth criteria may require ciena to make significant judgments or estimates 
reserve for inventory obsolescence ciena writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
during fiscal  we recorded a benefit for inventory reserves of million primarily related to the realization of sales from previously reserved excess inventory 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million primarily related to excess inventory due to a change in forecasted sales for certain products 
if actual market conditions differ from those we have projected  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs or benefits 
restructuring as part of its restructuring costs  ciena provides for the estimated cost of the net lease expense for facilities that are no longer being used 
the provision is equal to the fair value of the minimum future lease payments offset by the fair value of the estimated sublease payments 
due to the continued excess supply of commercial properties in certain markets where our unused facilities are located  we have reduced our estimate of the total future sublease payments we will receive 
as a result  we recorded an additional restructuring cost of million in fiscal as of the end of fiscal  ciena s accrued restructuring liability related to net lease expense and other related charges was million 
the total minimum lease payments for these restructured facilities are million 
these lease payments will be made over the lives of our leases  which range from seven months to fifteen years 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  we may be required to recognize additional restructuring costs associated with these facilities 
goodwill due to ciena s reorganization into operating segments  sfas requires that we assign goodwill to ciena s reporting units 
ciena has determined its operating segments and reporting units are the same 
in accordance with sfas ciena will test each reporting unit s goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
based on the operating results  forecasts  and business factors with the segments  ciena recorded an impairment loss of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal if actual market conditions differ or projected forecasts change at the time of our annual assessment in fiscal or in periods prior to our annual assessment  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges 
deferred tax valuation allowance as of october   ciena has recorded a valuation allowance of billion against our gross deferred tax assets of billion 
we calculated the valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
positive evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight when due to our current lack of visibility  there is a greater degree of uncertainty that the level of future profitability needed to record the deferred assets will be achieved 
our results over the most recent three year period were heavily affected by our recent business restructuring activities 
our cumulative loss in the most recent three year period represents sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on ciena s financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatory redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities 
the fasb has defined implementation of sfas indefinitely for certain non controlling interests  the provisions of which are currently not applicable to ciena 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on ciena s financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued a proposed statement  share based payment  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally would require instead that such transaction be accounted for using a fair value based method 
in october  the fasb delayed the effective date of the proposed statement from periods ending after january  until periods ending after june  ciena continues to monitor the potential impact of the proposed statement on its financial condition and results of operations 
in march  the fasb approved emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the objective of this issue is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf no 
also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued eitf no 
 which delayed the effective date of eitf no 
 with the exception of certain disclosure requirements 
ciena does not believe that eitf no 
will have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that 


under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal to require treatment as a current period charges 


this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement will be effective for inventory costs during the fiscal years beginning after june  ciena does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
quarterly results of operations the tables below in thousands  except per share data set forth the operating results and percentage of revenue represented by certain items in ciena s statements of operations for each of the eight quarters in the period ended october  this information is unaudited  but in our opinion reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

in addition to the other information contained in this report  you should consider the following factors before investing in our securities 
our business and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable and uncertain conditions in the communications industry 
the last three years have seen substantial changes in the communications industry 
many of our customers and potential customers  including communications service providers that have historically provided a significant portion of our sales  have confronted static or declining revenue 
many have experienced significant financial distress  and some have gone out of business 
others have announced their withdrawal from segments of the business 
this has resulted in significant changes in the structure of the communications networking industry  with greater concentration of purchasing power in a small number of large services providers  cable operators and government agencies  combined with a substantial reduction in the number of potential customers and overall demand 
together these factors have adversely affected our revenue and operating results 
in addition  most of our customers have become more conservative and uncertain about their future purchases  which has made managing our business difficult 
we expect the factors described above to continue to affect our business and results of operations for an indeterminate period  in several significant ways capital expenditures by many of our customers may be flat or reduced  we will continue to have only limited ability to forecast the volume and product mix of our sales  managing our expenditures will be difficult in light of the uncertainties surrounding our business  increased competition will enable customers to insist on more favorable terms and conditions for sales  including extended payment terms or other financing assistance  as a condition of procuring their business  and the bankruptcies or weakened financial condition of some of our customers may require us to write off amounts due to us from prior sales 
the result of any one or a combination of these factors could have a material adverse impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face intense competition from larger and smaller companies that could hurt our sales and profitability 
the markets in which we compete for sales of networking equipment  software and services are extremely competitive 
competition in these markets is based on price  functionality  manufacturing capability  installation  services  existing business and customer relationships  scalability and the ability of products and services to meet customers immediate and future network requirements 
competition in the market for sales to communications service providers is particularly intense 
a small number of very large companies have historically dominated the communications networking equipment industry 
we sell systems  software and services that compete directly with product offerings of these companies 
these competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater manufacturing capacity and better established relationships with incumbent carriers and other potential customers than ciena 
we also compete with a growing number of smaller companies that provide significant competition 
these emerging competitors often base their products on the latest available technologies  which may result in improved performance or cost reductions 
they may achieve commercial availability of their products more quickly due to the narrower focus of their efforts 
our inability to compete successfully against these companies would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
increased competitive tactics among providers of communications networking equipment and services could make it difficult to maintain our gross profit margins and could harm our results of operations 
greater concentration of purchasing power and decreased demand for communications networking products in recent years have resulted in increased competitive pressures 
we expect aggressive competitive tactics to continue  and perhaps become more severe 
these tactics include intense price competition in sales of new equipment  resulting in lower profit margins  discounting resulting from sales of used equipment or inventory that a competitor has written down or written off  early announcements of competing products and other extensive marketing efforts  one stop shopping options  competitors offering to repurchase ciena equipment from existing customers  customer financing assistance  marketing and advertising assistance  and intellectual property disputes 
tactics such as those described above can be particularly effective in a concentrated base of potential customers such as communications service providers 
our service provider customers are under increasing competitive pressure to deliver their services at the lowest possible cost 
this pressure may result in the pricing of communications networking systems becoming a more important factor in customer decisions 
this may favor larger competitors that can spread the effect of price discounts across a larger array of products and services and across a larger customer base than ours 
if we are unable to offset any reductions in the average sales price for our products by a reduction in the cost of our products  our gross profit margins will be adversely affected 
our inability to compete successfully and maintain our gross profit margins would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenue and operating results can fluctuate unpredictably from quarter to quarter 
purchases by customers in the markets that we serve can be unpredictable  sporadic and subject to unanticipated changes 
our results  in turn  can fluctuate unpredictably from quarter to quarter 
current economic and market conditions have made it even more difficult to make reliable estimates of future revenue 
fluctuations in our revenue can lead to even greater fluctuations in our operating results 
our budgeted expense levels depend in part on our expectations of long term future revenue 
any substantial adjustment to expenses to account for lower levels of revenue is difficult and takes time 
consequently  if our revenue does decline  our levels of inventory  operating expenses and general overhead would be high relative to our revenue  resulting in additional operating losses 
other factors can also contribute to fluctuations in our revenue and operating results  including variations and the mix between higher and lower margin products and services  fluctuations in demand for our products  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  the timing and size of orders from customers  including the impact of  and our ability to recognize revenue from  a significant customer contract  changes in customers requirements  including changes or cancellations to orders from customers  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  changes in the price or availability of components for our products  readiness of customer sites for installation  satisfaction of contractual customer acceptance criteria and related revenue recognition issues  manufacturing and shipment delays and deferrals  increased service  installation  warranty or repair costs  the timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on employee gains on stock options exercised  and changes in general economic conditions as well as those specific to our market segments 
we may not be successful in selling our products into new markets and developing and managing new sales channels 
we believe that  in order to grow our revenues and business  we must successfully penetrate new markets and build a larger and more diverse customer base 
as we have expanded our product portfolio through acquisitions  strategic relationships and internal development  we have entered and begun to sell our products in new markets  including enterprises  cable operators and federal  state and local governments 
we do not have as much experience in selling to these markets and have only recently realigned our internal sales resources to reflect the size of our addressable markets 
to succeed in these new markets  we believe we must develop and manage new sales channels through resellers  distributors and systems integrators 
since we have only limited experience in developing and managing such channels  it is uncertain to what extent we will be successful 
in addition  we have only recently formed ciena government solutions  inc for purposes of facilitating our government contracts activity 
sales to federal  state and local governments often require compliance with complex procurement rules and regulations with which we have little experience 
we may be unable to increase our sales to government contractors if we determine that we cannot comply with applicable rules and regulations 
in addition  failure to comply with rules and regulations for existing contracts could result in civil  criminal or administrative proceedings involving fines and suspension or debarment from federal government contracts 
failure to succeed in the cable  government and enterprise markets will adversely affect our ability to grow our customer base and revenues  which would adversely affect our profitability 
if we do not succeed in increasing our sales to large domestic and international service providers and adding additional service providers as customers  our business and revenues will suffer 
our future success will depend on our ability to increase our sales to large domestic and international service providers 
we have limited experience in selling to large service providers relative to many of our larger competitors 
many of our competitors have long standing relationships with such customers  which presents additional challenges to the sales process 
the sales cycle for these larger customers is often substantially longer than for sales to smaller customers and large service providers often require extensive testing of products before deciding to purchase them 
even after a product has been selected for a service provider s network and a contract has been signed  we are unable to recognize revenue until final network certification tests are completed satisfactorily  a process that is often lengthy and difficult 
complying with these certification requirements may involve unanticipated delays that could adversely affect our ability to sell to larger service providers or the timing of recognition of revenue 
if we do not succeed in increasing our sales to large service provider customers and adding additional service providers as customers  our business and revenues will suffer 
our strategy of pursuing strategic acquisitions and investments may expose us to increased costs and unexpected liabilities 
our business strategy includes acquiring or making strategic investments in other companies to increase our portfolio of products and services  expand the markets we address  diversify our customer base and to acquire or accelerate the development of new or improved products 
to do so  we may use cash  issue equity that would dilute our current stockholders ownership  incur debt or assume indebtedness 
in addition  we may incur significant amortization expenses related to intangible assets and charges associated with impairment of goodwill 
strategic investments and acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention  potential difficulties in completing projects of the acquired company and costs related to in process research and development  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  dependence on unfamiliar or relatively small supply partners  and exposure to unanticipated liabilities  including intellectual property infringement claims 
acquisitions and strategic investments may also involve risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience and competitors have stronger market positions 
as a result of these and other risks  any acquisitions or strategic investments may not reap the intended benefits and may ultimately have a negative impact on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
product performance problems  including difficulties arising as a result of our increasing reliance on direct order fulfillment for manufacturing  could damage our business reputation and limit our sales prospects 
the development and production of new products with high technology content is complicated and often involves problems with software  components and manufacturing methods 
we outsource the manufacturing of certain of our products to ems providers 
in addition  we expect to increasingly rely upon direct order fulfillment  through which our manufacturing providers will test our products on our behalf and deliver them directly to customers 
there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or enable us to realize the cost reductions and other intended benefits of these changes 
if significant reliability  quality  or network monitoring problems develop  including those due to defects in software or faulty components  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including costs associated with fixing software or hardware defects  high service and warranty expenses  payment of liquidated damages for performance failures  high inventory obsolescence expense  high levels of product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers 
although we maintain accruals for product warranties  actual costs could exceed these amounts 
from time to time  we encounter interruptions or delays in the activation of our products at a customer s site 
these interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from issues with installation and activation  some of which are outside our control 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that we cannot promptly resolve  confidence in our products could be undermined  which could cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business 
the steps that we are taking to restructure and reduce the size of our operations could disrupt our business 
since november  we have taken several steps  including reductions in force  dispositions of assets and office closures  and internally reorganizing our sales and engineering functions to reduce the size and cost of our operations and to better match our resources with our market opportunities 
during the next six to twelve months we expect to continue to take steps to reduce our operating expenses 
these efforts could cause disruption to our business in a number of ways that could result in lost revenue and increased expenses 
for example  if we do not effectively manage any effort to restructure our sales force and other customer facing operations  our relationships with our customers could be disturbed 
in addition to potential business disruption  our cost reduction efforts could result in accounting charges during the period of such restructuring 
restructuring costs  accelerated amortization of leasehold costs and asset impairment costs of million were incurred during our fiscal year  primarily associated with the september  closing of our san jose  california facility 
if we cannot manage our restructuring and cost reduction and restructuring efforts effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
we must continue to make substantial investments in product development in order to keep pace with technological advances and succeed in existing and new markets for our products 
in order to be successful  we must balance our initiatives to reduce our operating costs against the need to keep pace with technological advances 
the market for communications networking equipment  software and services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent introductions of new products  and recurring changes in customer requirements 
to succeed  we must continue to develop new products and new features for existing products 
in addition  we must be able to identify and gain access to new technologies as our market segments evolve 
we also believe that we must continue to invest research and development resources in our continuing effort to reduce our manufacturing costs for new and existing products 
managing these efforts to keep pace with new technologies and reduce manufacturing costs is difficult and there is no assurance that we will be successful 
we are investing substantial resources in developing and delivering products that reside toward the edge of large communications networks 
we have also undertaken a number of efforts to expand our addressable markets and the range of products and services we are able to offer existing and potential customers across the telecommunications  cable  government and enterprise markets 
we are implementing this strategy through a combination of internal development  acquisitions of smaller companies  and strategic alliances with other vendors 
at the same time  we are continuing to make the necessary investments to maintain our technology leadership in our core networking products 
if we do not execute this strategy effectively  our solutions could become less attractive to customers in one or more markets where we sell our products 
as a result  we could lose existing market share for core networking products to our competitors  and fail to succeed in the new markets that we are entering 
selling our products often involves a long sales cycle and requires substantial investments of our resources that may not produce anticipated benefits 
in order to sell our products to both potential and existing customers  we must invest in financial  engineering  manufacturing and logistics support resources  even though we are unsure of the volume  duration or timing of customer purchases 
our customers are generally technically sophisticated and demanding and the sales cycle for certain of our products is often lengthy 
because of lengthy sales cycles  ciena is increasingly subject to the impact of competitive threats and tactics that could result in ciena being unable to consummate a sale 
consequently  we may incur substantial expenses and devote time and resources to potential relationships that never materialize or fulfill our expectations  in which event our investment may largely be lost 
if we are required to further write down a significant portion of the approximately million of goodwill on our balance sheet at october   the related charge could result in a net loss for the period in which the write down occurs 
as of october   we had million of goodwill on our balance sheet 
this amount primarily represents the remaining excess of the total purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
at october   goodwill represented percent of our total assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of november  sfas no 
requires that we review and test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them 
prior to the reorganization of ciena into operating segments  the fair value of our goodwill was tested annually for impairment  and between annual tests if an event occurred or circumstances changed that would  more likely than not  have reduced the fair value of ciena on an enterprise entity level  rather than a segment level  below its carrying value 
due to our reorganization into operating segments  sfas requires that we assign goodwill to our reporting units 
we have determined that our operating segments and reporting units are the same 
in accordance with sfas we are required to annually test each segment reporting unit s goodwill for impairment  and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the segment reporting unit below its carrying value 
in connection with our annual test for impairment  we determined that the carrying value  including goodwill  of cng  mesg and bbg exceeded their respective fair value during the fourth quarter of as a result we assessed the fair value of the assets of these segments  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities and derived and implied fair value for each reporting unit s goodwill 
since the carrying amount of the goodwill assigned to cng  mesg and bbg was greater than the implied fair value  an impairment loss of million  million and million  respectively  was recognized in fiscal if we are required to further record impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets  such charges would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period 
if we are required to take a substantial impairment charge  our earnings per share or net loss per share would be adversely impacted in such period 
we may not be successful in enhancing and upgrading our products 
since our products are based on complex technology  we can experience unanticipated delays in developing  improving  manufacturing or deploying them 
modifying our products to enable customers to integrate them into a new type of network architecture entails similar development risks 
at any given time  various enhancements to our products are in the development phase and are not yet ready for commercial manufacturing or deployment 
the maturing process from laboratory prototype to customer trials  and subsequently to general availability  involves a number of steps  including completion of product development  the qualification and multiple sourcing of critical components  validation of manufacturing methods and processes  extensive quality assurance and reliability testing  and staffing of testing infrastructure  validation of software  and establishment of systems integration and systems test validation requirements 
each of these steps  in turn  presents serious risks of failure  rework or delay  any one of which could decrease the speed and scope of product introduction and marketplace acceptance of the product 
specialized application specific integrated circuits asics and intensive software testing and validation are key to the timely introduction of enhancements to several of our products  and schedule delays are common in the final validation phase  as well as in the manufacture of specialized asics 
in addition  unexpected intellectual property disputes  failure of critical design elements  and a host of other execution risks may delay or even prevent the introduction of these products 
if we do not develop and successfully introduce products in a timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
we may incur significant costs and our competitive position may suffer as a result of our efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or respond to claims of infringement from others 
despite efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
this is likely to become an increasingly important issue as we expand our operations and sales into countries that provide a lower level of protection for intellectual property 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
we have filed a patent infringement lawsuit to enforce our intellectual property rights  and may become involved with additional disputes in the future 
such lawsuits can be costly and may significantly divert the time and attention of our personnel 
we have also been subject to several claims of patent infringement  which in some cases have required us to pay the patent holders substantial sums or enter into license agreements requiring ongoing royalty payments 
the frequency of assertions of patent infringement is increasing as patent holders use such actions as a competitive tactic as well as to seek alternative sources of revenue 
there is a possibility that we may again find ourselves required to take patent licenses or to redesign or stop selling products that allegedly infringe patents belonging to others 
if we are sued for infringement and are unsuccessful in defending the suit  we could be subject to significant damages  and our business and customer relationships could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel  we may be unable to manage our business effectively 
if we are unable to retain and motivate our existing employees and attract qualified personnel to fill key positions  we may be unable to effectively develop our existing products  make timely product introductions and increase sales 
since we generally do not have employment contracts with our employees  we must rely upon providing competitive compensation packages and a dynamic work environment to retain and motivate employees 
in response to the decline in our revenue and weakness in the communications networking equipment market  we have not increased salaries for most of our employees since the end of fiscal in addition  we have paid our employees significantly reduced or no bonuses under our bonus program since the end of fiscal since our compensation packages include equity based incentives  pressure on our stock price could affect our ability to continue to offer competitive compensation packages to our employees 
in addition to these compensation issues  we must continue to motivate employees to execute our strategies and achieve our goals  which may be difficult due to morale challenges posed by the workforce reductions and uncertainty in our industry 
if we lose members of our management team or other key personnel  it may be difficult to replace them 
it may also be difficult to effectively execute our strategy of positioning ciena to benefit from opportunities in new markets 
competition for highly skilled technical and other personnel with experience our industry can be intense 
as a result  we may not be successful in identifying  recruiting and hiring qualified engineers and other key personnel 
we must appropriately manage our relationships with electronic manufacturing service ems providers responsible for the manufacturing of our products in order to ensure that our product requirements are met timely and effectively 
we rely on ems providers to perform the majority of the manufacturing operations for our products 
the qualification of these providers is an expensive and time consuming process  and these contract manufacturers build product for other companies  including our competitors 
in addition  we do not have contracts in place with some of these providers 
we may not be able to effectively manage our relationships with our ems providers  and we cannot be certain that they will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner 
if we underestimate our future product requirements  the ems providers may not have enough product to meet our customer requirements  and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products which could harm our business 
if we overestimate product requirements  we may have to write off excess inventory 
we are constantly reviewing our manufacturing capability  including the work of our ems providers  to ensure that our production requirements are met in terms of cost  capacity and quality 
periodically  we may decide to transfer the manufacturing of a product from one ems provider to another  to better meet our production needs 
it is possible that we may not effectively manage this transition or the new contract manufacturer may not perform as well as expected and  as a result  we may not be able to fill orders in a timely manner  which could harm our business 
our failure to manage our service delivery partners effectively could adversely impact our financial results and relationship with customers 
we rely on a number of service delivery partners  both domestic and international  to complement ciena s global service and support resources 
the certification of these partners incurs costs and is time consuming  and these partners service products for other companies  including our competitors 
we may not be able to effectively manage our relationships with our partners and we cannot be certain that they will be able to deliver our services in the manner or time required 
if our service partners are unsuccessful in delivering services our services revenue may be adversely affected  our relationship with customers could suffer  and we may suffer delays in recognizing product revenues in cases where revenue recognition is dependent upon product installation  testing and acceptance 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers  and for some items we do not have a substitute supplier 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components of our products  as well as for equipment used to manufacture and test our products 
our products include several high performance components for which reliable  high volume suppliers are particularly limited 
furthermore  some key optical and electronic components we use in our products are currently available only from sole or limited sources  and in some cases  that source also is a competitor 
any delay in component availability for any of our products could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenue 
these delays could also harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
furthermore  the market for optical components has recently been consolidated resulting in reduced competition  which could lead to higher prices 
in addition  the loss of a source of supply of key components could require us to re engineer products that use those components  which would increase our costs 
on occasion  we have experienced delays in receipt of components and have received components that do not perform according to their specifications 
any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments  which  in turn  could harm our business 
any delays in component availability for any of our products or test equipment could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenue from them 
these delays could also harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
risks associated with our international operations could make these operations more costly 
we market  sell and service our products globally 
we have established offices around the world  including in north america  europe  latin america and the asia pacific region 
we expect that our international activities will be dynamic over the foreseeable future as we enter some new markets and withdraw from or reduce operations in others in order to match our resources with revenue opportunities 
these changes to our international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources 
in some countries  our success will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local partners 
our inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements for international sales of our products could impact our ability to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
international operations are subject to inherent risks  and our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors 
these include greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  certification requirements  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  political and economic instability  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  effects of changes in currency exchange rates  service provider and government spending patterns  and natural disasters and epidemics 
such factors could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we may be required to assume warranty  service and other unexpected obligations in connection with our resale of complementary products of other companies 
we have entered into agreements with strategic partners that permit us to distribute the products of other companies 
as part of our strategy to diversify our customer base in the markets that we serve  we may enter into additional resale agreements in the future 
to the extent we succeed in reselling the products of these companies  we may be required by customers to assume warranty and service obligations 
while our suppliers have agreed to support us with respect to those obligations  they are relatively small companies with limited financial resources 
if they should be unable  for any reason  to provide the required support  we may have to expend our own resources on doing so 
this risk is amplified by the fact that the equipment has been designed and manufactured by others  and is thus subject to warranty claims whose magnitude we are currently unable to evaluate fully 
our exposure to the credit risks of our customers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
industry and economic conditions have weakened the financial position of some of our customers 
to sell to some of these customers  we may be required to take risks of uncollectible accounts 
while we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves  it is possible that we may have to write down or write off doubtful accounts 
such write downs or write offs  if large  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and stock price 
beginning with our annual report for our fiscal year ended october   section of the sarbanes oxley act of will require ciena to include a report by our management on our internal controls over financial reporting 
such report must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year and a statement as to whether or not such internal controls are effective 
such report must also contain a statement that our independent auditors have issued an attestation report on management s assessment of such internal controls 
in order to achieve timely compliance with section  in fiscal we began a process to document and evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting 
our efforts to comply with section have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  significant costs  the commitment of time and operational resources and the diversion of management s attention 
if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  we will be unable to assert such internal controls are effective 
if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective as of october  or if our independent auditors are unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on our management s evaluation or on the effectiveness of our internal controls  our business may be harmed 
market perception of our financial condition and the trading price of our stock may be adversely affected and customer perception of our business may suffer 
our stock price is volatile 
our common stock price has experienced substantial volatility in the past  and is likely to remain volatile in the future 
volatility can arise as a result of a number of the factors discussed in this risk factors section  as well as divergence between our actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts  and announcements that we  our competitors  or our customers may make 
forward looking statements some of the statements contained  or incorporated by reference  in this annual report discuss future expectations  contain projections of results of operations or financial condition or state other forward looking information 
those statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements 
the forward looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions 
in some cases  you can identify these so called forward looking statements by words like may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential or continue or the negative of those words and other comparable words 
you should be aware that those statements only reflect our predictions 
actual events or results may differ substantially 
important factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the forward looking statements are disclosed throughout this report  particularly under the heading risk factors above 
we do not undertake a duty to update any of our forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about ciena s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
ciena is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
ciena does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
ciena maintains a short term and long term investment portfolio 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at october   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  ciena faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and if our exposure increases  adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on ciena s financial results 
ciena s primary exposures are related to non dollar denominated operating expenses in canada  latin america  europe and asia where ciena sells primarily in us dollars 
ciena is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency if this exposure becomes material 
as of october   the assets and liabilities of ciena related to non dollar denominated currencies were not material 
therefore we do not expect an increase or decrease of in the foreign exchange rate would have a material impact on ciena s financial position
