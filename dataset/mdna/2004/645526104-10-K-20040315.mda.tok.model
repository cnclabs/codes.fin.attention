item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company operates and franchises computer training centers 
the company has two reporting units  company owned training centers and franchising operations 
the company owned training centers reporting unit operates wholly owned computer training centers in metropolitan cities within the continental united states and generates revenue through the sale and delivery of pc applications  technical software training courses and business skills courses 
the franchising operations reporting unit earns revenue through the sale of new horizons master and unit franchises within the united states and abroad  on going royalties in return for providing franchises systems of instruction  sales  and management concepts concerning computer training  and the sale of courseware materials and elearning products to franchises 
the franchising operations reporting unit has places of business in anaheim  california  amsterdam  netherlands  and singapore 
each reporting unit operates within the it training industry 
overview the it training industry is highly fragmented 
customers are serviced by multi national conglomerates that specialize in hardware and software implementations and provide initial training to support these products  electronics merchandisers that offer supplementary applications training  independent training providers such as the company  and accredited public and private institutions 
from to  the it training industry exhibited significant growth as a result of the advent of the internet and the number of pcs owned by households and used in the workplace 
additionally  the strength of the domestic capital markets during this time period fueled commercial growth and expansion that resulted in significant hardware and software implementations at commercial entities and a strong demand for it professionals and computer savvy employees 
since  the it training industry has experienced a decline from previous levels 
the decline in the it training industry mirrored the decline in domestic capital markets and has yet to recover similar to the domestic capital market s recovery in corporate it spending for hardware  software implementations  and employee training declined consistently with corporate earnings and stock valuations 
during this period corporations have been able to rely on existing it resources due to fiscal constraints and the lack of a revolutionary application which drives immediate business efficiencies 
in reaction to the aforementioned industry trends  the company has made significant reductions in its cost structure  identified additional sources of revenue  segmented its sales force  and continued to create products for increasingly complex customer needs 
reductions in cost structure although many of the company s costs are fixed in nature  such as facility lease costs and minimum staffing requirements  the company made significant reductions in its cost structure as a direct response to decreases in sales opportunities and student attendance 
the company has reduced headcount  maintained class delivery efficiency metrics  and benefited from a shift in sales mix favoring consumer sales 
additionally  the company has continued to reduce excess capacity through facility subleases 
the company has significantly reduced employee compensation expense during the past two years 
beginning in mid  the company performed three significant layoffs that resulted in the consolidation and restructuring of franchise support operations and reductions in both sales and non sales positions 
further  the company effected a salary and hiring freeze for all of its employees beginning in october the company monitors its exposure to compensation expense in terms of selling  instructor  and other non selling headcount 
the following table illustrates the company s selling and non selling headcount company owned training centers selling headcount instructor headcount other non selling headcount company owned training centers franchising operations total   the company has focused on maintaining minimum class delivery efficiency metrics in an attempt to scale down operations consistent with decreases in student attendance 
these metrics include number of students  number of training events  students per event  instructor utilization  and average price per class day 
instructor utilization represents the ratio of class days taught to the number of available instructor days 
the average price per day metric approximates the dollar value  per student class day  of products sold during a period 
maintaining minimum levels of instructor utilization and students per class performance metrics have allowed the company to consolidate course schedules 
schedule consolidation has reduced course delivery costs through a reduction in instructor headcount and the number of courses delivered 
the following table illustrates the company s class delivery efficiency metrics within the company owned training centers for the three years ended december  training events    number of students    students per event instructor utilization average price per day in addition to monitoring class delivery efficiency metrics  the company altered instructor compensation plans in to reduce instructor base compensation and increase instructor daily teaching bonuses 
these changes were made to make instructor compensation more variable in respect to number of days of instruction 
the shift in sales mix favoring consumer sales has had a positive benefit on the company s operating performance 
price points for consumer sales are typically higher due to volume purchase discounts issued to small to medium business and enterprise government customers 
the company s acquisition costs related to consumer sales have decreased dramatically due to the use of more effective marketing and advertising strategies  resulting in greater margins on consumer sales 
the company has continued to identify excess facility capacity resulting from decreases in student attendance and training events 
in  the company sublet excess capacity or executed lease termination agreements 
although these transactions resulted in of additional expense during  the company believes the actions will mitigate future expense and cash outlays with respect to these facilities 
additional sources of revenue and segmented sales force historically  the company s sales force almost exclusively targeted small to medium size businesses 
weak corporate operating performance  the perception that employee training is discretionary  and unemployment levels that find qualified it professionals without jobs have resulted in decreased sales opportunities at small to medium businesses 
as a result  the company identified additional revenue sources by dividing the it training market into three segments consumers  small to medium businesses  and governmental agencies and large corporations together known as the enterprise government segment 
each market segment has distinctly different characteristics 
consumers  or non employer sponsored individuals  need technical certifications and vendor specific skills required to gain employment in the it industry 
small to medium businesses necessitate it solutions to customer specific business problems 
enterprise government customers require it solutions to their business problems  as well as additional logistical support in the coordination of delivery of it training in multiple locations and modalities 
consumer demand has been fueled by higher unemployment rates and career minded individuals who seek to switch to an it related career 
consumer revenue growth has been exceptionally strong at the company owned centers as a result of strategic marketing campaigns and consumer oriented product offerings 
additionally  the company is often able to facilitate financing for consumer programs through third party financial institutions and or governmental agencies 
the company estimates the enterprise government segment to spend approximately billion annually on it related training 
given the number of domestic and international delivery locations within the new horizons network  the company s elearning product offerings  and the release of the integrated learning manager in july  the company believes it is now poised to effectively service this segment 
during  the company invested significantly in enterprise government segment infrastructure and sales personnel and  as a result  both enterprise government sales and requests for proposal activity have shown significant growth  primarily due to contracts executed with governmental agencies 
in order to effectively sell into the consumer  small to medium business  and enterprise government segments  the company divided its sales force accordingly 
under the segmented model  sales persons focus on an individual market segment 
additionally  the company added additional core competencies to its existing sales force 
these core competencies include more sophisticated sales techniques used in an attempt to diagnose business problems and prescribe it solutions 
the company anticipates these competencies can be leveraged across each market segment 
increasingly complex customer needs the needs of it training customers have become increasingly more complex 
during the industry s rapid growth  customers required specific software applications training to make employees more efficient in the workplace and to train their it staff on recently acquired technologies and new it standards 
currently  customers are seeking it solutions to customer specific business problems  as well as multiple delivery methods  and a high return on investment 
in reaction to the change in customer needs  the company has continued to develop relevant product offerings for each market segment  enhanced its ability to provide blended learning solutions  and committed to obtaining the highest of quality rankings available in the industry 
to address the customer specific business problems of small to medium and enterprise government  the company increased its course offerings to include a higher volume of technical courses  cross vendor platform programs and vendor neutral programs that provide students appropriate technical knowledge to solve current day business issues such as information security  network administration  project management  and fundamental business skills and written communication 
in  the company released course offerings on additional topics such as wireless networks and help desk certification 
in response to consumer needs  the company developed a multitude of programs that enable students to obtain technical certifications necessary to gain employment in the it profession 
these certification programs include microsoft certified system administrator  microsoft certified system engineer  a  network  security  and cisco certified network administrator 
additionally  the company has developed english as a second language esl courses for consumers that are popular internationally 
in the future  the company intends to increase course offerings which target consumers  namely in the field of health information management 
the company has continued to increase its capability to deliver integrated learning solutions including instructor led and elearning delivery 
through the company s online live and online anytime product offerings  the company has products which offer online access to an array of technology based training courses and content  in addition to its instructor led course offerings 
the company s elearning products have been well received  primarily because elearning products provide customers the ability for mobile and remote workers to access training through web conferencing software and self paced content libraries 
additionally  elearning products are typically less expensive than traditional  instructor led training and more cost effective 
in addition to elearning product offerings  the company has invested in excess of  in its proprietary integrated learning manager and expects to invest an additional in the integrated learning manager enables employers to create employee training plans and monitor employee performance on a real time basis 
the company has also focused on its ability to deliver the highest quality training in the industry 
to monitor the quality of instruction  the company utilizes metrics that matter scores  which are independent student satisfaction surveys conducted at each of microsoft s certified partner learning solutions centers 
at december  new horizons had more centers ranked in the top twenty in overall customer satisfaction than all other training centers combined 
successful product development materializes into customer demand for new horizons training products 
the company analyzes two key performance indicators in judging the demand for new horizons training products 
these key performance indicators include non elearning courseware sales and system wide sales comparisons 
non elearning courseware sales are comprised primarily of physical courseware and other class materials  such as kits and books  sold to the franchise network 
the company views these figures as an indicator of the sales and delivery volume occurring throughout the franchise network 
non elearning courseware sales for the years ended december    and are illustrated in the table below non elearning courseware sales    system wide revenues are defined as the revenues from company owned training centers and revenues reported to the company by its domestic and international franchises 
same center revenues represent revenues from company owned training centers and franchises open during both periods of comparison 
total system wide revenues for the years ended december   and are illustrated in the table below total system wide revenues    total system wide same center revenues are illustrated in the table below vs

system wide same center revenues    results of operations versus revenues revenues totaled  during the year ended december   an increase of  from  during the same period in the increase in revenue is the result of the net effect of a revenue increase at company owned training centers of  and a decrease in franchising revenue of  company owned training centers company owned training centers earned revenue of  in the year ended december   an increase of  or  from  during the same period in the increase in company owned training center revenue is due to increased consumer and elearning product sales  partially offset by weak demand in the small to medium business segment 
increases in consumer sales are attributable to the success of the company s consumer segment initiative  which has focused on the creation of courses of study specifically designed to enable consumers to learn skills necessary to become employable as it professionals  as well as the development and implementation of marketing strategies targeting consumers 
consumer revenue increased approximately in consumer sales comprised approximately of company owned training centers revenue in the year ended december   an increase of from in revenues associated with the company s elearning products  including online live and online anytime  increased  or  at company owned training centers during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  due to continued market penetration 
franchising operations franchising revenues totaled  during the year ended december   a decrease of  as compared to the same period in the decrease in franchising revenues resulted from decreases in franchise royalties and other courseware sales not associated with elearning products  net against increases in initial franchise fees and franchise renewal fees and elearning products 
initial franchise fees and franchise renewal fees increased  primarily due to revenues earned from the australia  taiwan  and germany master franchises or sub franchises during during  revenues earned from the india master franchise comprised the only significant revenues earned from master franchises or sub franchises 
revenues associated with the sale of the company s elearning products to franchisees  including online live and online anytime  increased 
increases in elearning product revenues are due to continued market penetration 
franchise royalties and sales of courseware unaffiliated with elearning products decreased a combined  or  resulting from decreased system wide revenues and lesser demand for it training domestically 
system wide revenues system wide revenues totaled  during the year ended december   a decrease of  or  from  during the same period in the decrease in system wide revenues resulted from significant decreases in sales opportunities from small to medium businesses and student attendance 
these decreases resulted in revenue decreases at north american franchises and franchise closures 
north american franchises have not yet replicated revenue increases in the consumer segment in similar proportion to company owned training centers  and therefore have not mitigated revenue decreases associated with the weakness in small to medium business market 
as a result  north american franchises suffered revenue decreases in excess of  or 
system wide same center sales for the year ended december  totaled  a decrease of  from  during the same period in the decrease is the result of decreased revenues in north american franchise locations  net against moderate same center revenue increases at international franchises of and company owned training centers of 
cost of revenues cost of revenues totaled  during the year ended december   a decrease of  or  from  during the same period in as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues decreased as a result of higher margins realized on elearning and consumer sales  combined with benefits from schedule consolidation and headcount reductions  and reductions in depreciation expense of  resulting from decreases in capital expenditures 
these cost benefits were partially offset by losses of recorded in connection with the sub lease and termination of excess training facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  during the year ended december   an increase of  or  from  in the same period of as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively stable as compared to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars is the result of increases in expenses incurred in the els initiative  and various legal expenses  net against costs savings in sales and marketing expenses associated with company owned training centers 
the company s els initiative is designed to facilitate the delivery of it training to large corporate customers at company owned and franchised training centers 
during  the els initiative was expanded to provide enhanced account strategy services and sales support to the franchise network 
els initiative expenses increased  during the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses at company owned training centers decreased approximately during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  resulting from headcount reduction and reduced advertising costs 
interest expense interest expense totaled for the year ended december   a decrease of  from  recorded during the same period in the decrease is the result of a lesser amount of outstanding debt in and a decrease in the effective interest rate on the company s floating rate debt facility 
results of operations versus revenues total revenues decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the company owned and franchising operating segments experienced decreases of  and  respectively 
company owned training centers company owned revenues decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  during the same time period  same center revenues decreased in excess of as a result of the continued softness of the domestic economy and adjusted revenue recognition rates 
due to the lagging domestic economy  corporations  organizations  government  and municipalities decreased their levels of spending on technology and technology related products  including it training 
reduced demand caused a significant decrease in the number of student training days delivered  and a corresponding decrease in applications and technical course revenue of  as well as decreases in other sources of revenue of  these decreases were partially offset by increased revenue from the company s elearning courses of  as a result of an update to its historical studies of student attendance patterns in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that in certain programs  primarily training vouchers and technical certification programs  students were taking longer to complete classes compared to past historical experience 
as a result  the company adjusted its revenue recognition rates for each of the programs affected 
the change in revenue recognition rates resulted in a decrease of  in revenue as compared to the decrease in revenue within the company owned segment is partially offset by a full year of revenue for the indianapolis and atlanta centers  which were acquired in early franchising operations franchising revenue decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december the decrease in franchising revenue is due to lower amounts of initial fees and royalties earned in  partially offset by increases in courseware sales to franchisees 
initial franchise fees decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the continued softness in the domestic and global economies resulted in decreased demand for new franchises and the execution of fewer new franchise agreements during the year as compared to royalty fees decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease in royalty fees is due to decreases in same center revenue at franchise locations and a net reduction of franchise centers during same center revenue decreased approximately at franchise centers 
at december   there were franchise locations in operation  a decrease of from the franchise locations in operation at december  other franchising revenues increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in other franchising revenues is due to a full year of sales of microsoft official curriculum  elearning courseware  and student learning guides 
the company began offering each of these products during system wide system wide revenues  defined as revenues from all centers  both company owned and franchised  decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ending december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues increased from in to in the increase  as a percentage of revenues  is due to increased sales of lower margin items  including courseware and elearning products  and the effect of under utilized fixed costs 
facility costs  instructor wages  and other fixed costs comprise a significant portion of the company s cost of revenue 
although the company  on an on going basis  attempts to minimize under utilized fixed costs through cost management initiatives  these initiatives have been unable to reduce fixed costs at the same rate as the reduction in revenue 
cost management initiatives include managing employee headcount  class schedule consolidation  and the sublease of under utilized facilities 
the decrease in cost of revenues  in dollar terms  is attributable to a decrease in variable costs and the effects of cost management initiatives executed throughout the year  partially offset by losses on sub leases of under utilized facilities of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ending december  upon adopting sfas no 
in january  the company ceased amortizing goodwill 
in   of goodwill amortization expense was classified within selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the remaining decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is attributable to decreases in sales commissions of  and the effect of cost management initiatives executed throughout the year 
impairment of goodwill effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are tested for impairment annually and also in the event of an impairment indicator 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the company completed a transitional impairment test based on the fair values of the company s company owned centers and franchising reporting units as of january  the transitional impairment test resulted in a pretax impairment charge of  against goodwill related to the company owned centers reporting unit 
the transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the amount of  net of tax 
the transitional impairment charge was the result of a fundamental change in the measurement of impairment losses resulting from the company s adoption of sfas no 
the company performed its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of as a result of the annual impairment test  the company recorded a pretax impairment charge of  the fourth quarter impairment charge was the result of a significant decrease in the fair value of the company s company owned centers reporting unit 
the company utilized an independent valuation consultant to assist it in determining the fair value of the company s reporting units as part of the impairment testing 
these consultants determined the fair value of the company s reporting units utilized in impairment testing 
these consultants considered both the income approach and market approach in determining fair value 
under the income approach and market approach  management s estimates of future profitability and market capitalization were used in determining fair value 
the decrease in fair value of the company owned center reporting unit was attributable to the continued softness of the domestic economy and downward revisions in management s estimates of the future profitability of company owned centers 
during the year ended december   the domestic economy was characterized by decreases in capital and technology related expenditures by corporations and organizations 
the decrease in technology related expenditures significantly affected the capital markets and resulted in decreases in the stock prices and market capitalization of publicly traded entities within the technology sector 
prior to the fourth quarter of  management believed the domestic economy and  more specifically  technology related spending would rebound in early and improve operating performance 
the variance between the company s estimated and actual operating results in the latter half of  in addition to the lack of positive indicators that the technology sector will return as quickly as previously thought  has caused management to revise its estimates as to the future profitability of the company owned centers downward 
interest income interest income for decreased or to compared with in as a percentage of revenues  interest income decreased to for from for interest expense interest expense increased to  for or compared to  in as a percentage of revenues  interest expense was in and in the increase in interest expense in absolute dollars was due to higher outstanding debt in as compared to  and the write off of unamortized bank fees related to the previous credit agreement that was replaced with a new credit agreement in february income taxes the provision for income taxes as a percentage of loss before taxes was for the decreased benefit was primarily related to foreign taxes which were not offset by federal credits and a reduction in tax benefit due to the tax treatment of the impairment of non deductible goodwill 
the provision for tax expense in was reduced to primarily due to the tax treatment of a non recurring gain 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following critical accounting policies include a accounting estimates made by management that were highly uncertain at the time of estimation  and b accounting estimates in which there were a range of potential reasonable estimates the company could have used in the current period and changes in these estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
changes in these estimates could potentially have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial position or results of operations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for training vouchers  technical tracks and programs  and club arrangements of certain durations based on estimates of how the company delivers training to customers over the service period 
these estimates differ from the straight line method 
combined  these products comprise a material amount of the company s consolidated revenues 
management has determined historical student attendance pattern rates are the best estimate of how the company will deliver training to customers in the future 
the company performs historical student attendance analyses on a quarterly basis 
in these analyses  the company reviews of the sales transactions for these products  selected randomly  to determine the number of courses delivered under each arrangement and the time period between each course date and the invoice date 
based on this data  the company is able to determine the historical rates at which customers have attended class for each product type 
in order to provide customers with adequate time to take courses  the company allows a period of one year from the date of sale before performing student attendance analyses 
historical student attendance data from the past eight analyses  or two years of trailing data  are combined to determine the estimates used in revenue recognition 
due to the use of estimated delivery rates rather than actual delivery  revenue recognition for training vouchers  technical tracks and programs  and club arrangements based on estimated delivery rates could differ materially from that of actual course delivery 
additionally  the company s estimates based on historical student attendance patterns may not accurately forecast future attendance patterns 
the continual revision of estimated student attendance rates may result in cumulative adjustments to revenue recognized for sales transactions consummated in prior periods 
generally  the student attendance analyses indicate a greater percentage of attendance in the earlier months and the last month of the time periods associated with training vouchers  club memberships  and technical certification programs 
thus  a greater percentage of revenues are recognized in these time periods than if the straight line method were applied 
deferred costs the company defers those direct and incremental costs associated with the sale of products and services for which revenue is deferred 
direct and incremental costs associated with the sale of products and services for which revenue is deferred include commissions paid to sales persons and technology and hosting costs associated with the company s elearning products 
deferred costs are recorded to earnings at the same rate that the associated product revenues are recorded to earnings 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are shown net of allowances for uncollectible accounts 
the company s management makes estimates of the collectibility of trade receivables based on historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and geographic location 
the company records an allowance for bad debt separately for its franchising and company owned training centers segments 
the franchising segment records an allowance for bad debt each period based upon specifically identified uncollectible receivables  the geographic location of the customer and historical experience of bad debts 
the company owned training centers segment records an allowance for bad debt based upon a precentage of outstanding receivables 
the percentage applied differs by each of the individual centers within the company owned training centers segment and is estimated based on each center s historical experience 
the company owned training centers segment records an allowance for bad debt based upon a percentage of outstanding receivables 
the percentage applied differs by each of the individual centers within the company owned training centers segment and is estimated based on each center s historical experience 
deferred tax asset in preparing the consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes for federal and state purposes 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established or this allowance is increased in a period  an expense must be included within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company regularly analyzes the future recovery of its deferred tax assets based on its best estimates of future taxable income 
taxable income is forecasted over the periods in which the deferred tax assets relate 
in order to realize its deferred tax asset balance of  at december   the company s future taxable income must exceed approximately  over a period of up to thirty years 
accounting for goodwill the goodwill balances attributable to the company s franchising and company owned centers reporting units are tested for impairment annually and also in the event of an impairment indicator 
impairment tests are comprised of two steps 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the reporting unit s goodwill is considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is required 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess  limited to the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill 
the company utilizes outside valuation consultants in determining the fair value of its reporting units 
the consultant utilizes both the income approach and the market approach in determining fair value 
the consultant s fair value estimates using the income approach utilize the company s best estimates of future operating performance 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of cash are comprised of sales of it training courses at company owned training centers  the sale of master and unit franchise territories  continuing royalties from franchises  courseware sales to franchises  and available credit on the company s debt facility with wells fargo bank
