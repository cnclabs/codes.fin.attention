item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the following management s discussion and analysis contains various forward looking statements which reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to those identified below  which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of their dates 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new 
table of contents information  future events or otherwise 
the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated weather  supply and demand of commodities including grains  fertilizer and other basic raw materials  market prices for grains and the potential for increased margin requirements  environmental and governmental policies  competition  economic conditions  risks associated with acquisitions  interest rates  and income taxes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and judgments are based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical  as these policies are important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and or require significant or complex judgment by management 
note of the consolidated financial statements more fully describes all of our significant accounting policies  however  following are those accounting policies that management considers most critical to the company s financial statements 
grain inventories the company marks to market all grain inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts for grain  and exchange traded futures and options contracts 
the grain inventories are freely traded  have quoted market prices  and may be sold without significant additional processing 
management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets 
changes in market value are recorded as merchandising revenues in the statement of income 
if management used different methods or factors to estimate market value  amounts reported as inventories and merchandising revenues could differ 
additionally  if market conditions change subsequent to year end  amounts reported in future periods as inventories and merchandising revenues could differ 
because the company marks inventories and sales commitments to the market  gross profit on a grain sale transaction is recognized when a contract for sale of the grain is executed 
the related revenue is recognized upon shipment of the grain  at which time title transfers and customer acceptance occurs 
grain inventories contain valuation reserves established to recognize the difference in quality and value between contractual grades and actual quality grades of inventory held by the company 
these quality reserves also require management to exercise judgment 
marketing agreement the company has negotiated a marketing agreement that covers certain of its grain facilities certain of which are leased from cargill 
under this five year amended and restated agreement ending in may  the company sells grain from these facilities to cargill at market prices 
income earned from operating the 
table of contents facilities including buying  storing and selling grain and providing grain marketing services to its producer customers over a specified threshold is shared with cargill 
measurement of this threshold is made on a cumulative basis and cash is paid to cargill if required at each contract year end 
the company recognizes its share of income to date at each month end and accrues for any payment to cargill in accordance with emerging issues task force topic d  accounting for management fees based on a formula 
the adoption of this standard  effective for periods beginning after january   resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment increase of million after tax in derivatives commodity contracts the company utilizes regulated commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its market price exposure on the grain it owns and related forward purchase and sale contracts 
these contracts are included in the balance sheet in inventory at their current market value 
realized and unrealized gains and losses in the market value of these futures and option contracts are included in the income statement as a component of sales and merchandising revenues 
while the company considers all of its commodity contracts to be effective economic hedges  the company does not designate its commodity futures and options contracts as hedges 
therefore  the company does not defer gains and losses on these same contracts as would occur for designated hedges under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
both the underlying inventory and forward purchase and sale contracts and the related futures and options contracts are marked to market on a daily basis 
impairment of long lived assets the company s various business segments are each highly capital intensive and require significant investment in facilities and or rolling stock 
in addition  the company has a limited amount of intangible assets and goodwill described more fully in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item that it acquired in various business combinations 
whenever changing conditions warrant  we review the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets that may be impacted 
we also annually review the balance of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter 
these reviews for impairment take into account estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease term  operating costs  life of the assets  potential disposition proceeds  budgets and long range plans 
while we believe the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized 
if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these cash flows  the company could recognize different amounts of expense in future periods 
employee benefit plans the company provides substantially all full time employees with pension benefits and postretirement health care benefits 
in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans  management makes several estimates and assumptions  including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities  
table of contents rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates and anticipated future healthcare cost trends 
these estimates and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience combined with management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
the company uses third party specialists to assist management in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans 
if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly and then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
certain accounting guidance  including the guidance applicable to pensions and postretirement benefits does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience or the revision of an estimate 
this approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted 
although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements  the net amount is disclosed as an unrecognized gain or loss in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item at december   we had an unrecognized loss related to our pension plans of million compared to an unrecognized loss of million at december  for the postretirement benefit plans  our december  unrecognized loss was million as compared to an unrecognized loss of million at december  a portion of the december  unrecognized loss for both pension and postretirement benefits will be amortized into earnings in the effect on years after will depend in large part on the actual experience of the plans in and beyond 
in  benefits expense included million of amortization and million of the unrecognized loss existing at december  for the pension and postretirement plans  respectively 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for the sales of its products at the time of shipment 
gross profit on sales of grain is recognized when sales contracts are entered into as the company marks its contracts to the market on a daily basis 
revenues from other merchandising activities are recognized as open grain contracts are marked to market or as related services are provided 
rental revenues on operating leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
sales returns and allowances  if required  are provided for at the time sales are recorded 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
the company sells railcars to financial intermediaries and other customers 
proceeds from railcar sales  including railcars sold in non recourse transactions  are recognized as revenue at the time of sale if there is no leaseback or the operating lease is assigned to the buyer  non recourse to the company 
revenue on operating leases where the company is the lessor and on servicing and maintenance contracts in non recourse transactions is recognized over the term of the lease or service contract 

table of contents leasing activities the company accounts for its leasing activity in accordance with fasb statement no 
 as amended  and related pronouncements 
the company s rail segment leases and manages railcars for third parties and leases railcars for internal use 
most leases to rail segment customers are structured as operating leases 
railcars leased by the company to its customers are either owned by the company  leased from financial intermediaries under operating leases or leased from financial intermediaries under capital leases 
the leases from financial intermediaries are generally structured as sale leaseback transactions 
lease income and lease expense are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the company has financed some of its railcars through a capital lease with a financial intermediary 
the terms of this lease required the company to capitalize the assets and record the net present value of the lease obligation on its balance sheet as a long term borrowing 
there was no gain or loss on this financing transaction 
this obligation is included with the company s long term debt as described in note to the consolidated annual financial statements 
the railcars under this lease are being depreciated to their residual value over the term of the lease 
the company also arranges non recourse lease transactions under which it sells railcars or locomotives to financial intermediaries and assigns the related operating lease on a non recourse basis 
the company generally provides ongoing railcar maintenance and management services for the financial intermediaries  and receives a fee for such services when earned 
on the date of sale  the company recognizes the proceeds from sales of railcars in non recourse lease transactions as revenue 
management and service fees are recognized as revenue as the underlying services are provided  which is generally spread evenly over the lease term 
taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item 

table of contents operating results the following discussion focuses on the operating results as shown in the consolidated statements of income 
following are tables in thousands highlighting sales and merchandising revenues  gross profit and operating income by segment 
additional segment information is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item sales and merchandising revenues agriculture rail processing retail total gross profit agriculture rail processing retail total operating income loss agriculture rail processing retail other total comparison of with sales and merchandising revenues for totaled billion  an increase of million  or  from sales in the agriculture group were up million  or 
increased grain sales of million included both a volume increase and an increase in the average price of bushels sold 
all grains  except oats  showed price per bushel increases and bushel volume was up for all grains except wheat 
in both and  grain expected to ship in the following calendar year was shipped in the fourth quarter 
this occurred because of increased demand and or market prices favoring sales rather than storage of grain 
fertilizer sales were up million  or  due to a increase in the average price per ton sold on a less than one percent increase in volume 
a portion of the price increase relates to increases in natural gas prices  a basic raw material in the manufacture of nitrogen and urea which are key products used by the plant nutrient division 
generally  this increase can be passed through to customers although a 
table of contents price increase may also reduce consumer demand at the producer level 
revenues in both grain and fertilizer businesses are significantly impacted by the market price of the commodities being sold 
merchandising revenues in the agriculture group were down million  or  due to decreases in space income before interest charges in the grain division 
space income is income earned on grain held for our account or for our customers and includes storage fees earned and appreciation or depreciation in the value of grain owned 
grain on hand at december  was million bushels  of which million bushels were stored for others 
total grain bushels on hand throughout averaged approximately million bushels due to the reduced harvest in this compares to million bushels on hand at december   of which million bushels were stored for others 
the results of the harvest were strong in the company s market area 
due to the strong demand  however  bushels shipped nearly matched the bushels received and resulted in no net increase in bushels 
because of this  the company anticipates another period of low space income in the first six months of wheat acres planted in for harvest in are down slightly from last year due to the wet and delayed harvest 
corn acres are expected to increase in due to the current higher corn prices 
this increase will come at the expense of bean acres 
the higher grain prices may favorably impact the fertilizer demand for the same period 
however  poor weather during the spring planting season may unfavorably impact the amount of corn and soybean acreage planted during that time 
the rail group had a million  or increase in sales 
sales of railcars and related leases made up million of this increase and the remainder of the increase resulted from a million increase in revenue generated by the leased fleet and a million increase from increased activity in the repair and fabrication shops 
there were no significant sales of railcars in railcars under management at december  were  compared to  under management at december  locomotives under management were at december  and at december  the railcar utilization railcars in lease service rate increased from at december  to at the end of december the processing group had a million  or  increase in sales and merchandising revenues resulting primarily from an overall increase in volume plus a increase in the average price per ton sold 
in the professional lawn business  serving the golf course and lawn care operator markets  volume was up and sales up  primarily due to increased market share 
in the consumer and industrial lawn businesses  where we serve as contract manufacturer for several large brand companies  a manufacturer of private label products and also manufacture our own brands  volume was up and sales up 
a portion of this increase relates to a new line of products that we began manufacturing for a major marketer in late the cob business  a much smaller 
table of contents component of the processing group  had a increase in sales primarily due to a increase in volume 
the retail group had a decrease in same store sales and revenues in as compared to individual store results were mixed  however  the columbus markets showed increases for the third straight year 
as expected  sales in the toledo market were down due to significant new competition as well as disruption in one of the three toledo area stores created when the store was completely redesigned 
four of the six stores now have a fresh meat counter 
this business is managed by a third party and the company earns commissions on sales of fresh meat  these commissions have been included in merchandising revenues 
expectations for remain cautiously optimistic given increases seen in january business  however  this business continues to be faced with competition from new stores built and planned for in its primary markets by competitors of significant size 
gross profit for totaled million  an increase of million  or less than  from the agriculture group had a million  or  decrease in gross profit  in spite of the significant increase in revenues mentioned previously 
gross profit in the grain division totaled million  a decrease of million  or  resulting primarily from the million decrease in merchandising revenues mentioned previously  partially offset by a million increase in gross profit on grain sales 
the plant nutrient division recognized an increase in gross profit of million  primarily due to the increase in volume and a increase in gross profit per ton 
gross profit in the rail group increased million  or 
a portion of this increase  million  was gross profit related to the sale of cars and lease receivables 
the railcar and fabrication shops had increased gross profit of million related to the manufacture and or installation of railcar components 
the lease fleet income was down million in spite of the increased fleet size and utilization percentage 
railcars that are coming off long term leases are renewing at market rates which may be lower than the previous lease rates 
the multi year low lease rate environment has continued in the rail industry  although certain car types have seen improvements in in  the company recorded an impairment charge of million on railcars assets leased to others 
there was no impairment charge in gross profit for the processing group in increased million  or  when compared to in spite of a increase in volume  increased costs reduced the gross profit per ton by 
the consumer and industrial lawn businesses had increased gross profit  but the professional lawn business and cob business both realized decreases 
a portion of this increased cost represents the increasing cost of nitrogen and other raw materials that aren t easily passed on to customers during an annual program 

table of contents gross profit in the retail group decreased million  or  from this was due to the decrease in sales discussed previously  partially offset by a modest increase in margins  as a result of changes in the mix of products sold 
the company recorded a gain of million in related to an insurance recovery 
operating  administrative and general expenses for totaled million  a million increase from full time employees were approximately equal to  however  labor expense increased million  or 
benefit costs rose due to the increased cost of providing pension and health care benefits to current and former employees 
other significant increases were realized in utilities  reflecting the high cost of natural gas and the need to dry a wet corn crop and professional and contract services  reflecting additional expense relating to external legal fees  accounting and audit services and corporate governance expenses 
some of the professional and contract services increase was related to acquisition activity 
with the recently announced growth in our agriculture and rail groups  we expect incremental increases in the cost to manage these additional assets 
interest expense for was million  a million  or  decrease from average daily short term borrowings for were up when compared to while the average short term interest rate decreased from for to for long term interest expense decreased for the same period 
as a result of the above  pretax income of million for was higher than the pretax income of million in income tax expense of million was recorded in at an effective rate of 
in  income tax expense of million was recorded at an effective rate of 
the increase in effective tax rates between and resulted primarily from an increase in state income taxes 
in future years  we anticipate potential increases in state effective tax rates resulting from state tax reform initiatives 
in fiscal  the world trade organization determined that the extraterritorial income regime  or eti  as provided for in the us internal revenue code  is an illegal export subsidy 
accordingly  the company anticipates that the united states will repeal the eti during fiscal various proposals before the us congress may replace the eti  but even if adopted  would likely not result in the same level of income tax benefit to the company as the eti 
therefore  it is possible that the company s tax rate will increase in fiscal and beyond  pending the outcome of these potential changes in the law 
the eti benefit reduced the company s tax rate by percentage points 
the company is presently unable to determine the effect of the potential tax law changes and there can be no assurance that such changes will not adversely affect its results of operations in future years 

table of contents in  the company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment upon the adoption of eitf topic d million after tax

the industrial lawn business where the group is responsible only for the contract manufacturing of product and does no marketing continues to grow in relative size  due  in part  to the movement of a large consumer customer to an industrial relationship 
the company receives less margin for industrial tons  as compared to consumer tons  because it is acting primarily as a contract manufacturer and not incurring certain sales and 
table of contents marketing costs 
further  the company is no longer required to accept returns from the customer

financing for the acquisition was provided by million in non recourse notes 

table of contents certain of the company s long term borrowings include provisions that impose minimum levels of working capital and equity  impose limitations on additional debt and require that grain inventory positions be substantially hedged 
the company was in compliance with all of these provisions at december  in addition  certain of the company s long term borrowings are secured by first mortgages on various facilities or are collateralized by railcar assets 
because the company is a significant consumer of short term debt in peak seasons and the majority of this is variable rate debt  increases in interest rates could have a significant impact on the profitability of the company 
in addition  periods of high grain prices and or unfavorable market conditions could require the company to make additional margin deposits on its cbot futures contracts 
the marketability of the company s grain inventories and the availability of short term lines of credit enhance the company s liquidity 
in the opinion of management  the company s liquidity is adequate to meet short term and long term needs

future years can be assumed to approximate this same range of funding 
included in long term debt are acquisition liabilities that include minimum royalty payments 
there are additional contingent sales based royalty payments that have not triggered to date and which are not expected to be material to the company if they trigger in the future 
the royalty period ends may the company had standby letters of credit outstanding of million at december  of which million are credit enhancements for industrial revenue bonds included in the contractual obligations table above 
approximately of the operating lease commitments above relate to  railcars that the company leases from financial intermediaries 
see the following section on off balance sheet transactions 
the company is subject to various loan covenants as highlighted previously 
although the company is and has been in compliance with its covenants  noncompliance could result in default and acceleration of long term debt payments 
the company does not anticipate noncompliance with its covenants 
off balance sheet transactions the company s rail group utilizes leasing arrangements that provide off balance sheet financing for its activities 
the company leases railcars from financial intermediaries under operating leases through sale leaseback transactions  the majority of which involve operating leasebacks 
railcars owned by the company  or leased by the company from a financial intermediary  are generally leased to a customer under an operating lease 
the company also arranges non recourse lease transactions under which it sells railcars or locomotives to a financial intermediary  and assigns the related operating lease to the financial intermediary on a non recourse basis 
in such arrangements  the company generally provides ongoing railcar maintenance and management services for the financial intermediary  and receives a fee for such services 
on most of the railcars and locomotives  the company holds an option to purchase these assets at the end of the lease 

table of contents the following table describes the railcar and locomotive positions at december  method of control financial statement number owned railcars available for sale on balance sheet current owned railcar assets leased to others on balance sheet non current  railcars leased from financial institutions off balance sheet  railcars non recourse arrangements off balance sheet  total railcars  locomotives leased from financial intermediaries under limited recourse arrangements off balance sheet locomotives non recourse arrangements off balance sheet total locomotives additionally  the company manages  railcars for a third party customer for which it receives a fee 
the company has future lease payment commitments aggregating million for the railcars leased by the company from financial intermediaries under various operating leases 
remaining lease terms vary with none exceeding years 
the majority of these railcars have been leased to customers at december  over similar terms 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item for more detail about future lease income 
the segment manages risk by matching lease commitments with funding which means matching terms between the lease to the customer and the funding arrangement with the financial intermediary where possible and ongoing evaluation of lessee credit worthiness 
in addition  the company prefers non recourse lease transactions  whenever possible  in order to minimize its credit risk 
as noted previously  the company s acquisition of railroad rolling stock and leasing assets in february added approximately  railcars  locomotives and contracts to manage another  railcars to the above balances 
nearly all of the purchased assets are owned outright by subsidiaries of top cat holding company llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the andersons  inc  and will appear on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the majority of the assets are included in a debt securitization whereby financing of million was raised to fund the purchase 
this financing is non recourse to the company and looks only to the securitized assets for collateral 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 

table of contents commodity prices the availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  government domestic and foreign farm programs and policies  changes in global demand created by population growth and higher standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations  the company follows a policy of hedging its inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
the instruments used are exchange traded futures and options contracts that function as hedges 
the market value of exchange traded futures and options used for hedging has a high  but not perfect correlation  to the underlying market value of grain inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
the less correlated portion of inventory and purchase and sale contract market value known as basis is much less volatile than the overall market value of exchange traded futures and tends to follow historical patterns 
the company manages this less volatile risk using its daily grain position report to constantly monitor its position relative to the price changes in the market 
the company s accounting policy for its futures and options hedges  as well as the underlying inventory positions and purchase and sale contracts  is to mark them to the market price daily and include gains and losses in the statement of income in sales and merchandising revenues 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk of its commodity position exclusive of basis risk 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of inventories  related purchase and sale contracts and exchange traded contracts 
the fair value of the position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in such prices 
the result of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  is as follows december in thousands net short long position market risk 
table of contents interest rates the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
in addition  the company has derivative interest rate contracts recorded in its balance sheet at their fair value 
the fair value of these contracts is estimated based on quoted market termination values 
market risk  which is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one half percent decrease in interest rates  is summarized below december in thousands fair value of long term debt and interest rate contracts fair value in excess of carrying value market risk
