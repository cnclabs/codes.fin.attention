item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations outlook and overview the financial results for continued to reflect the current depressed conditions in most drilling markets 
barge drilling rig dayrates in the gulf of mexico drilling market were depressed during despite natural gas prices remaining at historically high levels during the period 
we believe this can be attributed to several factors  including operators addressing debt reduction issues  lack of acceptable well prospects for major oil companies and funding issues for independent operators 
consistent with these market conditions  barge rig utilization and dayrates declined one percent and nine percent  respectively  during when compared to we believe that the factors mentioned above have become less significant and that utilization and dayrates have improved during the first quarter of if natural gas prices remain at current levels  we expect the continuation of the current trend 
during we had two incidents that resulted in significant damage to two of our rigs in the gulf of mexico 
on september   a malfunction caused one side of jackup rig to become partially submerged in the water  resulting in significant damage to the rig and the loss of certain drilling equipment overboard 
after being towed to the shipyard  the damages were analyzed and an insurance claim submitted  which is presently under consideration 
we believe that substantially all of the loss will be covered by insurance 
our insurance is based on replacement cost and is thus expected to exceed the net book value of the rig plus costs incurred to tow it to the shipyard and evaluate the damage 
on november   we experienced a well control incident during completion operations on our workover barge rig the barge rig was declared a total loss and we received million in insurance proceeds in december  which was in excess of the loss incurred 
revenues and operating income in our rental tools business in the gulf of mexico increased during when compared to revenues increased primarily due to more deep water projects and the addition of new customers in the gulf of mexico 
in addition  contributing to the increase has been the opening of quail tools new evanston  wyoming operation that meets the market niche of quail tools as they continue to establish a solid customer base 
the commonwealth of independent states former soviet union  referred to herein as cis is our leading market of international land operations 
in addition to our established operations in kazakhstan and russia  one of our subsidiaries signed a three year  two rig contract in with calik enerji  as to provide drilling services to turkmenneft state concern in turkmenistan 
one drilling rig began operations in early november  the second rig is on site and is expected to begin drilling operations in the first quarter of our remaining international land operations showed signs of improvement during the fourth quarter of due primarily to new contracts in our asia pacific operation 
we have two new contracts in new zealand and a new contract in bangladesh 
the new contracts in new zealand and bangladesh are anticipated to last from nine to twelve months 
we continue to experience increased bidding activity in new zealand 
our international barge drilling operations were negatively impacted during by continued community unrest in nigeria 
one incident has resulted in the shutdown and evacuation of barge rig since march we have been unable to access the barge rig due to the ongoing community unrest 
based on a very preliminary high fly over assessment by our customer in july  we recorded a charge of approximately million in june  to account for the portion of the estimated repair costs that will not be covered by insurance 
although the rig is still not accessible  indirect reports that are not verifiable indicate that the rig has sustained significant damage that is not quantifiable at this time 
we believe that the damage to this rig will be covered by insurance 
in the caspian sea  our arctic class barge rig completed its initial four year contract in november as of the end of  barge rig was stacked and we are currently in discussions with potential customers  however  we do not anticipate that this rig will resume operations until late or early considering the current unrest in nigeria and the status of rig  we expect international barge drilling operations to remain flat or decline in 
table of contents outlook and overview continued in  our board of directors approved a plan to sell our non core assets to generate funds to enhance our debt reduction capabilities 
as of december   our fleet of rigs held for sale consisted of six shallow water jackup rigs and four offshore platform rigs located in the gulf of mexico and land rigs and related inventory and spare parts located in latin america 
we identified these assets for sale based on the relatively low utilization rates of the land rigs and platform rigs and the wide fluctuations in the dayrates for the jackup rigs 
the operations that constitute this plan of disposition meet the requirements of discontinued operations under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and have been reclassified to present our latin america operations and our us jackup and platform drilling operations as discontinued operations 
the assets held for sale have been written down to their estimated fair value  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million recognized in the second quarter of we will continue to report separately the results of operations of these discontinued operations until the closing of the actual sales 
although no asset sales were consummated during  we used some of our existing cash and cash flows to repay million as a first step toward our goal of a debt reduction of million 
since december   we have further reduced our debt an additional million by purchasing million of our convertible subordinated notes and paying off the remaining boeing capital corporation note which had a balance of million 
during october  we completed a refinancing of a portion of our debt 
the total refinancing package was for million comprised of million of senior notes due and the replacement of our senior credit facility with a million delayed draw term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
proceeds from the refinancing were used to retire in full the outstanding million of our senior notes due we believe these transactions have provided adequate financial flexibility to pursue asset sales in a very determined but conservative fashion 
the transactions have neither reduced our resolve to successfully complete asset sales nor modified our january goal to reduce debt by million 
we continue to be vigilant in our efforts to conserve cash by reducing our general and administrative expenses and limiting our capital expenditures 
we reduced our general and administrative expenses in to million from million in by reducing our corporate workforce in and by limiting administrative costs 
we will continue to make adjustments as appropriate for the level of our operations 
our capital expenditure program calls for limiting expenditures to scheduled ongoing maintenance projects  our preventive maintenance program and capital projects that we believe have the potential to yield an attractive rate of return 
as a result  our capital expenditures for were million 
during our fourth quarter conference call with investors  management confirmed its previously released earnings guidance 
based on current prices for natural gas and oil  management is anticipating that domestic dayrates will improve slightly and both international and domestic utilization will continue to increase during the combined result of the anticipated debt reduction and improved utilization is expected to result in a loss in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for of to 
we are projecting to return to profitability during the third quarter of 
table of contents results of operations continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  we recorded a loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  we recognized a change in accounting principle related to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

year ended december  dollars in thousands drilling and rental revenues us drilling international drilling rental tools total drilling and rental revenues the reduction in revenues from million to million was attributed to reduced drilling activity worldwide as a result of the economic downturn in the united states and increased inventories of oil and natural gas 
us drilling revenues from continuing operations of barge rigs decreased million in to million due primarily to lower dayrates 
the gulf of mexico market declined significantly during the fourth quarter of and continued throughout and due primarily to a reduction in drilling activity 
average dayrates declined nine percent during as compared to utilization for the barge rigs remained comparable year to year  percent in and percent in although prices for natural gas have risen  uncertainty regarding the economy and international issues caused operators to be hesitant to significantly increase drilling in international drilling revenues decreased million to million in as compared to  of which million was attributed to a decrease in international land drilling revenues 
international land drilling revenues in the cis region increased million in primarily attributed to commencement of drilling operations on sakhalin island in russia 
drilling activity began in june  on a five year contract with five one year options  contributing revenues of million 
this increase was partially offset by decreased revenues in kazakhstan 
in the karachaganak field we worked three rigs during while only one worked during the remaining rig in the karachaganak field is expected to continue drilling through in addition  in december  one tco owned rig for which we provided labor services was released  resulting in reduced revenues in this rig was reinstated and returned to active drilling in november revenues decreased in the asia pacific region by million related primarily to reduced utilization in papua new guinea and indonesia 
this decrease was partially offset by a new contract in bangladesh that began drilling during the fourth quarter of international offshore drilling revenues accounted for the remaining million decrease in international drilling revenues and were attributable entirely to nigeria 
in march  two of the three barge rigs suspended drilling and were evacuated due to community unrest 
after evacuation both barge rigs were placed on force majeure rates at approximately percent of the full dayrate 
one of the barge rigs  rig  returned to full operations while the second barge rig remains evacuated 
in april  barge rig was placed on a standby rate at approximately percent of the full dayrate 
this dayrate will terminate in march as of december   barge rigs and are operating on full dayrates and barge rig remains on the reduced standby rate 
barge rig has been stacked since the completion of its contract during the third quarter of 
table of contents results of operations continued rental tools revenues increased million in as quail tools reported revenues of million 
revenues increased million from the new iberia  louisiana operation  increased million from the victoria  texas operation  decreased million from the odessa  texas operation and generated an increase of million from its new operation in evanston  wyoming 
both the new iberia  louisiana and victoria  texas operations experienced an increase in customer demand due to increased deep water drilling in the gulf of mexico 
the odessa  texas operation was down seven percent in as compared to due to a decrease in customer activity in the region and a highly competitive pricing environment

table of contents results of operations continued drilling and rental operating income of million for the year ended december  reflected a decrease of million from decreased gross margins in the us drilling operations and international operations were partially offset by increased gross margin in the rental tools operations 
the us drilling operations gross margin decreased million during the current period 
the gross margin percentage decreased from percent to percent primarily attributed to the decrease in barge rig revenues in the current period 
international drilling gross margin decreased million in as compared to the year ended december  international land drilling gross margin decreased million to million in due primarily to the reduced revenues in our land drilling operations in kazakhstan  papua new guinea and new zealand  as previously discussed 
the gross margin percentage for the international land drilling decreased from percent to percent in the current year 
the international offshore drilling gross margin decreased million to million for the decrease is primarily attributed to reduced revenues resulting from the community unrest issues in nigeria as previously discussed 
gross margins in nigeria decreased approximately million during the current year as compared to this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in gross margin related to barge rig in the caspian sea 
the year was positively impacted by demobilization revenues that exceeded the costs to stack barge rig upon completion of the contract in the fourth quarter of the prior year was negatively impacted by an additional assessment for property taxes 
rental tools gross margin increased million to million during the current year as compared to gross margin percentage increased to percent during the current year as compared to percent for the year ended december   due to a percent increase in revenues and only a six percent increase in operating expenses during the period 
the slight increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by increased administrative costs and increased man hours worked 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million during the current period 
depreciation expense increased due to capital additions during during the first quarter of  we announced a new contract to build and operate a rig to drill extended reach wells to offshore targets from a land based location on sakhalin island  russia for an international consortium 
the revenues and expenses for the construction phase of the project are recognized as construction contract revenues and expenses  with the profit calculated on a percentage of completion basis 
we recognized profit of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to this decrease is primarily attributed to the following salaries and wages decreased million as a result of the reduction in force in june  professional and legal fees decreased million  a million decrease in property and franchise tax expense  and unscheduled maintenance of million on the former corporate headquarters in tulsa  oklahoma during the remaining decrease is a result of the ongoing cost reduction program implemented in during  we recognized a provision for reduction in carrying value of certain assets of million 
three non marketable rigs in the asia pacific region and certain spare parts and equipment in new iberia  louisiana were impaired by million to estimated salvage value 
subsequent to december   we signed an agreement to sell the new iberia  louisiana land and buildings for a net sales price of million 
this resulted in an impairment of million at december   as the net book value of the property exceeded the net sales price 

table of contents results of operations continued interest expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to during the first quarter of  we entered into three million swap agreements that resulted in million in interest savings during the swap agreements were terminated during the third quarter of effective july   interest expense increased due to the exchange of million in principal amount of new senior notes due for a like amount of senior notes due partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in interest from the purchase of million of convertible subordinated notes on the open market in may  reduced interest resulting from the principal reduction of the boeing capital corporation note and the amortization of the swap gain recognized upon liquidation of the swap agreements 
in conjunction with our refinancing of a portion of our debt  we incurred million of costs related to the retirement of our senior notes 
these costs have been recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt and include costs of the premium to call the senior notes  write off of remaining capitalized debt issuance costs offset by the write off of the remaining swap gain that was being amortized over the remaining life of the senior notes 
this amount is included in other income expense in the selected financial data 
other income expense improved million in the current year as compared to the year ended december  the year ended included million related to the debt exchange offer completed in the second quarter of and million costs incurred for an attempted acquisition 
this amount is included in other income expense in the selected financial data 
income tax expense from continuing operations consists of foreign tax expense of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  income tax expense from continuing operations included foreign tax expense of million and deferred tax benefit of million 
in the year to year comparison foreign taxes increased million 
however  this was primarily due to a realized tax benefit in from a kazakhstan tax ruling related to a prior year filing 
for the current year we incurred a net loss  however  no additional deferred tax benefit was recognized since the sum of our deferred tax assets  principally the net operating loss carryforwards  exceeds the deferred tax liabilities  principally the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation 
this additional deferred tax asset was fully reserved through a valuation allowance in the current year

table of contents results of operations continued the million reduction in revenues from the latin america region was due primarily to fewer drilling contracts and thus the region operated an average of only rigs during the current year as compared to rigs during the year ended december  the decline in utilization is primarily attributed to colombia and ecuador  partially offset by operations in peru 
in  ecuador had one rig operating  the contract was completed in late and the rig has been moved to bangladesh 
peru had one rig operating at full dayrate during as compared to a partial year for the year ended december  gross margin in the latin america region decreased million to million in the current year as compared to the year ended december  the loss of four contracts with one customer in colombia in mid and completion of one contract in ecuador contributed to the decline in gross margin 
of the four contracts cancelled in colombia  only one rig returned to work for the customer in early the other three rigs maintained approximately the same utilization in as revenues for the us jackup and platform drilling operations increased million to million in as compared to the jackup rigs contributed to the increase with higher utilization and improved dayrates 
utilization for the jackup rigs increased from percent to percent and average dayrates improved percent for as compared to the year ended december  the us jackup and platform drilling operations gross margin was million in the current period  an increase of million from the gross margin was positively impacted in the current period by higher dayrates and utilization for the jackup rigs and platform rigs as previously discussed

us barge drilling revenues decreased million in to million due primarily to decreased dayrates and reduced utilization 
the gulf of mexico market declined significantly during the fourth quarter of and continued throughout due primarily to a reduction in drilling activity by operators 
this reduction in drilling activity was in response to declining demand and prices for natural gas and the economic recession in the united states that began during mid although prices for natural gas had risen  uncertainty regarding the economy and international issues had caused operators to be hesitant to significantly increase drilling in utilization for the barge rigs decreased from percent in to percent in with a percent decrease in dayrates

additionally  we increased the number of labor contracts in kuwait from two rigs in to six rigs in resulting in additional revenues of million 
international offshore drilling revenues decreased million to million when compared to  primarily attributable to nigeria 
during the second and third quarters  two of our four barge rigs operating in nigeria incurred downtime for required american bureau of shipping abs inspections and repairs that resulted in a combined total of five months with no revenues 
shortly after returning to work the drilling contracts for these two barge rigs concluded and only one contract was subsequently renewed

the kazakhstan increase was primarily attributable to increased utilization in the tengiz field and the early termination fees received for the two rigs released that were previously operating in the karachaganak field 
the gross margin increase in russia was due to higher than anticipated mobilization and start up costs incurred in that resulted in a significant loss 
asia pacific region gross margin increased million to million during improvement in asia pacific is primarily related to increased revenues in papua new guinea that resulted in increased gross margin of million 
international offshore drilling gross margins decreased million to million during this decrease in gross margin is primarily attributed to nigeria where two of the four barge rigs incurred a combined total of five months downtime during the second and third quarters due to abs inspections and repairs

latin america revenues decreased million in as compared to the decrease primarily related to reduced utilization in colombia and bolivia 
during the fourth quarter of  colombia and bolivia had six rigs and one rig working  respectively 
at december   colombia had three rigs working and bolivia had no rig activity 
in colombia  we had four drilling rigs working for a customer when the operator terminated all drilling activity in may since then  one rig has returned to work for this particular customer 
the drilling market in bolivia  which diminished significantly in mid  showed no signs of recovery throughout  primarily due to reduced demand for natural gas from brazil 
contributing to the reduced demand in were delays in receiving the bolivian government s commitment to a new gas pipeline to the west coast of south america to enable the exporting of natural gas to mexico and the united states

table of contents liquidity and capital resources continued in october  we refinanced a portion of our existing debt by issuing million of new senior notes due and replaced our senior credit facility with a million senior credit agreement 
the senior credit agreement consists of a four year million delayed draw term loan facility and a three year million revolving credit facility that are secured by certain drilling rigs  rental tools equipment  accounts receivable and substantially all of the stock of the subsidiaries  and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants 
the proceeds of the new senior notes  plus an initial draw of million under the term loan facility  were used to retire million of the senior notes due that had been tendered pursuant to a tender offer dated september  the balance of the proceeds from the new senior notes and the initial draw down under the term loan facility were used to retire the remaining million of senior notes that were not tendered 
we redeemed the remaining bonds on november  at a call premium of percent 
the revolving credit facility portion of the senior credit agreement replaces the previous million revolving credit facility that would have expired in late october the revolving credit facility is available for working capital requirements  general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit

table of contents other matters business risks internationally  we specialize in drilling geologically challenging wells in locations that are difficult to access and or involve harsh environmental conditions 
our international services are primarily utilized by major and national oil companies in the exploration and development of reserves of oil 
in the united states  we primarily drill in the coastal and offshore waters of the gulf of mexico with barge  jackup and platform rigs for major and independent oil and gas companies 
business activity is primarily dependent on the exploration and development activities of the companies that make up our customer base 
generally  temporary fluctuations in oil and gas prices do not materially affect these companies exploration and development activities and consequently do not materially affect our operations  except for the gulf of mexico  where drilling contracts are generally for a shorter term  and oil and gas companies tend to respond more quickly to upward or downward changes in prices 
many international contracts are of longer duration and oil and gas companies have committed to longer term projects to develop reserves and thus our international operations are not as susceptible to shorter term fluctuations in prices 
however  sustained increases or decreases in oil and natural gas prices could have an impact on customers long term exploration and development activities  which in turn could materially affect our operations 
generally  a sustained change in the price of oil would have a greater impact on our international operations while a sustained change in the price of natural gas would have a greater effect on us operations 
due to the locations in which we drill  our operations are subject to interruption  prolonged suspension and possible expropriation due to political instability and local community unrest 
further  we are exposed to liability issues from pollution and to loss of revenues in the event of a blowout 
the majority of the political and environmental risks are transferred to the operator by contract or otherwise insured 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  materials and supplies obsolescence  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  workers compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that such estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 
these policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
our management periodically evaluates our property  plant and equipment to determine that the net carrying value is not in excess of the net realizable value 
we review our property  plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired 
for example  evaluations are performed when we have realized sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates and recovery is not contemplated in the near future  or when reclassifications are made between property and equipment and assets held for sale as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
our management considers a number of factors such as estimated undiscounted future cash flows  appraisals and current market value analysis in determining net realizable value 
assets are written down to fair value if they are below net carrying value 

table of contents other matters continued during the second quarter of  our board of directors approved a plan to sell our non core assets which as of december  includes our latin america assets consisting of land rigs and related inventory and spare parts and our us offshore assets consisting of six jackup rigs and four platform rigs 
we are actively marketing the assets through an independent broker 
at june   the net book value of the assets to be sold exceeded the fair value and as a result an impairment charge including estimated sales expenses was recognized in the amount of million 
in december  the salvage values on three non marketable land rigs in our asia pacific region and certain spare parts and equipment located at our new iberia  louisiana facility were impaired 
we provided a provision totaling million for this equipment 
subsequent to december   we entered into an agreement to sell our land and buildings in new iberia  louisiana 
the net sales price approximates million which resulted in a provision for impairment of million for the land and buildings 
this impairment was recognized in the december  consolidated financial statements 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets  and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets 
impairment of goodwill 
our management periodically assesses whether the excess of cost over net assets acquired is impaired based on the estimated fair value of the operation to which it relates  which value is generally determined based on estimated future cash flows of that operation 
if the estimated fair value is in excess of the carrying value of the operation  no further analysis is performed 
if the fair value of each operation  to which goodwill has been assigned  is less than the carrying value  we will deduct the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and compare the residual amount to the carrying value of the goodwill to determine if impairment should be recorded 
changes in the assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value  which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the annual review  we also test for impairment should an event occur or circumstances change that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we discontinued the amortization of million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we performed an initial impairment review of goodwill and impaired goodwill by million 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill at year end and determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying value as of december   accordingly  no impairment was recorded 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and the net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we established a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 

table of contents other matters continued revenues recognition 
we recognize revenues and expenses on dayrate contracts as the drilling progresses percentage of completion method because we do not bear the risk of completion of the well 
for meterage contracts  which are rare  we recognize the revenues and expenses upon completion of the well completed contract method 
revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months 
mobilization revenues  related costs and reimbursements for customer required rig equipment or refurbishments  if significant  are amortized over the term of the related drilling contracts 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards regarding the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
became effective for the company starting in the quarter ended september  the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
a variable interest entity vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity from financing its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii equity holders at risk either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity  b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
if an entity is deemed to be a vie  pursuant to fin  an enterprise that absorbs the majority of the expected losses of the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
the application of fin as amended by fin r is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application by public entities other than small business issuers for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  we adopted this interpretation in december and implementation of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our results of operations or our financial position 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab no 
related to multiple element revenue arrangements  which was superseded as a result of the issuance of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
while the wording of sab no 
has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf no 
 the revenue recognition principles of sab no 
remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab no 
the implementation of sab no 
is not expected to affect the company s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk from our fixed rate debt 
in january  we hedged against a portion of the risk of changes in fair value associated with our million senior notes by entering into three fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million 
we assumed no ineffectiveness as each interest rate swap agreement met the short cut method requirements under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  for fair value hedges of debt instruments 
as a result  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings 
during the year ended december   the interest rate swap agreements reduced interest expense by million 
on july   we terminated all the interest rate swap agreements and received million 
a gain totaling million was being amortized as a reduction to interest expense and was subsequently included in the loss on the debt extinguishment of the senior notes in october during  million was recognized as a reduction to interest expense and a gain of million was included in loss on extinguishment of debt
