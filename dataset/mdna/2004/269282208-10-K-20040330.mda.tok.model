the mechanical equipment segment operations in continued to decline due to the economic downturn  especially in the telecommunications area 
this was the second year of reporting a reduction of sales in spite of a strong sales effort and management s work to introduce new products acceptance 
the plastics and rubber segment operations in were little changed from the prior year 
the industry s attempts to introduce major new products into the marketplace did not materialize 
the us dollar weakness during the year along with the west coast dock strike and continuing increases in labor and other marketing costs  provided added pressure to maintain profit margins 
the small improvement in the plastics and rubber segment operations was not reflective of any industry trend  but the continuation of customers balancing their inventory levels

critical accounting policies we have prepared our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
this has required us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affected the amounts we reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements contains the significant accounting principles that we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified a few critical accounting policies that required us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time of our estimates 
had we used different estimates and assumptions  the amounts we recorded could have been significantly different 
additionally  actual results that would have a material effect on our accounting policies that were affected by the estimates  assumptions  and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are listed below 
inventories 
certain of our inventories are valued at the lower of cost  on the last in  first out lifo method  or market 
the remainder of our inventories are valued at the lower of cost  on the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we periodically assess this inventory for obsolescence and potential excess by reducing the difference between our cost and the estimated market value of the inventory based on assumptions about future demand and historical sales patterns 
if market conditions or future demand are less favorable than our current expectations  additional inventory write downs or reserves may be required  which could have an adverse effect on our reported results in the period the adjustments are made 
income taxes 
we comply with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that our future taxable income will be sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks our cash and cash equivalent investments are exclusively in short term money market investments and us treasury money market investments with maturities generally less than days 
they are subject to limited interest rate risks 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements
