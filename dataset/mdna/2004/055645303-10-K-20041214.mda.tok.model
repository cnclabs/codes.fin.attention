item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general our primary business operations involves the origination and servicing of mortgage loans 
our profitability in any year is most affected by the principal amount of loans originated during any such year  the type of loans originated and the payoff and pay down of outstanding mortgage loans during such year 
these factors determine to a significant extent the interest income and fee income earned during such year 
we cannot project the principal amount or type of loans which will be originated in any year or those loan applications submitted to us which will be approved by our loan committee or board of trustees  as is applicable  nor can we project the rate of payoff or pay down against our loan portfolio in any year 
as noted in the discussion below  the fiscal year reflects an increase in interest and fee income compared to the fiscal year and the fiscal year reflects a decrease in interest and fee income  compared to the fiscal year 
the primary components of these changes is a result of loan originations  including the type of loans originated  and loan payoffs and pay downs 
we cannot project nor have we ascertained any trends in our business other than that our loan originations have been more national in scope and our loan applications and loan originations have been for larger principal amounts 
both of these factors we attribute to the increase in our advertising and marketing activities 
vs 
interest and fees on loans increased to  for the year ended september   as compared to  for the year ended september   an increase of  or 
during the current fiscal year we experienced an increase in the volume of loan originations that caused the average balance of loans outstanding to increase to  in the current fiscal year from  this resulted in an increase in interest income of  also contributing to an increase in interest income was the receipt of  of interest in excess of the stated rate on four loans that went into default during the year but have since been returned to performing 
offsetting these increases was a decline in the interest rate earned on the portfolio 
the average rate earned on the loan portfolio declined basis points from in the prior fiscal year to in the current fiscal year 
this resulted in a  decline in interest income 
also  in the prior fiscal year  we recognized  of interest income on the payoff of a loan that was previously recorded as non performing 
we recognized an increase of  in fee income in  which is consistent with the increased loan volume experienced during the period 
however this increase was offset by the collection of  in fees in the prior fiscal year that were due upon the payoff of two loans 
other  primarily investment income  declined  or  from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  during the first half of the current fiscal year and the last half of the prior fiscal year  we sold shares of entertainment properties trust and various other securities which resulted in a decline of  of dividend income 
offsetting this decline was an increase  from to  in the dividend paid on our remaining shares of epr which accounted for an increase of  the remaining  decline in investment income was the result of the sale of miscellaneous securities and reduction in the amount of funds available for investment 
interest expense on borrowed funds increased to  in the fiscal year ended september  from  in the fiscal year ended september  this increase of  or  is due to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds outstanding  which increased  from  in the prior fiscal year to  in the current fiscal year 
this caused an increase in interest expense of  this increase was offset by a decline in the average rate paid on borrowings from to 
the average interest rate includes a 
fee to maintain a margin account secured by the shares we own in entertainment properties trust and is based on the value of the assets in the account 
the fee paid to reit management corp 
the advisor s fee  which is calculated pursuant to agreement and is based on invested assets  increased  or  in the fiscal year ended september  to  from  in the fiscal year ended september  during the current fiscal year  we experienced a larger outstanding balance of invested assets  primarily loans  thereby causing an increase in the fee 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in the fiscal year ended september  from  in the fiscal year ended september  this increase of  or  was the result of several factors 
payroll and payroll related expenses increased  as a result of staff additions  increased commissions paid to loan originators and restricted stock amortization 
there was also a  increase in expenses allocated to us  primarily legal and accounting expenses  pursuant to a shared services agreement among us and related entities 
legal expenses also increased  a result of three foreclosure actions that we have pending and legal fees incurred in connection with the organization of a de novo bank as a taxable reit subsidiary 
we have decided not to pursue the banking activity at this time 
the remaining increase in expense of  was due to higher operating expenses in several categories  none of which was significant 
other taxes decreased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended september  from  in the fiscal year ended september  the decrease is the result of a  reduction in the amount of excise tax recorded 
during the current year we increased the dividend paid to shareholders 
by paying to our shareholders more of our earnings within the prescribed time frame  we reduced the excise tax payment 
the excise tax is based on taxable income that has been generated but not yet distributed 
this was offset by the payment of  in federal income taxes in the current fiscal year on earnings that were not distributed to shareholders 
the remaining decline of  is due to a reduction in the amount of state franchise taxes paid in the current fiscal year 
operating expenses relating to real estate increased  or  from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  the increase is the result of legal fees and other expenses incurred in defending a lawsuit relating to a property previously owned by us 
this lawsuit was resolved in june equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased  or  from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  this decrease resulted from the sale in the prior year of a cooperative unit by one venture and the sale of a parcel of vacant land by a second venture 
there were no similar sales in the current fiscal year 
gain on sale of available for sale securities declined  or  from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  in the current fiscal year we sold  shares of atlantic liberty financial and  shares of entertainment properties trust and other miscellaneous securities which resulted in net proceeds of  and had a cost basis of  in the prior fiscal year we sold  shares of entertainment properties trust and other miscellaneous securities which resulted in net proceeds of  and had a cost basis of  for the fiscal year ended september  gain on sale of real estate assets increased to  from  in the fiscal year ended september  in the current fiscal year the gain resulted from the sale of one condominium and four cooperative apartment units 
in the prior fiscal year the gain was the result of the sale of two cooperative apartment units 
vs 
interest and fees on loans decreased to  for the year ended september  as compared to  for the year ended september  this decrease of  or  was the result of several factors 
in the current fiscal year  the average balance of loans declined  to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
this caused a decrease of  in interest income 
the average rate earned on the loan portfolio declined basis points to as compared to earned on the portfolio in the fiscal year ended september  this decline caused interest income to decline by  in the prior fiscal year  four participating loans were paid off resulting in additional income and fees of  in the fiscal year ended september  offsetting these declines was the collection of interest income in the amount of  in the current fiscal year from a loan that was previously recorded as non performing 
fee income also increased  in the current fiscal year  primarily because of the collection of fees that were due upon the payoff of two loans 
the fiscal year ended september  was favorably affected by  recognized from the recovery of a previously provided allowance related to a loan that was previously impaired and was paid off in full in there was no comparable revenue item in the current fiscal year 
other  primarily investment income  declined  or  from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  the decline was primarily caused by a decrease in the amount of dividends received on our reit securities caused by our sale of reit securities during the fiscal year 
interest expense on borrowed funds increased to  in the fiscal year ended september  from  in the fiscal year ended september  this increase of  or  is due to an increase in the average rate paid for borrowings from in the fiscal year to in the fiscal year 
the average interest rate includes a fee to maintain a margin account secured by the shares we own in entertainment properties trust and is based on the value of the assets in the account  which appreciated in value during the fiscal year 
the advisor s fee  which is calculated pursuant to agreement and is based on invested assets  decreased  or  in the fiscal year ended september  to  from  in the fiscal year ended september  during this period  we experienced a lower outstanding balance of invested assets thereby causing a decrease in the fee 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in the fiscal year ended september   from  in the fiscal year ended september  this increase of  or  is primarily the result of increases in payroll and payroll related expenses which increased  from the prior year 
in addition professional fees increased by approximately  from the fiscal year 
other taxes increased by to  for the fiscal year ended september  from  in the fiscal year ended september  the increase of  in the current fiscal year is the result of an increase in the federal excise tax  which is based on taxable income that was generated but not yet distributed 
operating expenses relating to real estate increased  or  from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  in the current fiscal year we experienced higher legal expenses relating to a property that we acquired in foreclosure in a prior fiscal year  increased insurance expense and increased common area maintenance charges 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures declined  or  to  in the fiscal year ended september  from  in the fiscal year ended september  in the current fiscal year one of our joint ventures wrote off expenses relating to a terminated development project 
additionally  several of our joint ventures have seen modest declines in income due to declines in occupancy and rental rates 
offsetting these declines was an increase that resulted from reduced lease payments on a ground lease position held by a joint venture as ground lessee 
gain on the sale of real estate assets decreased  or  in the fiscal year ended september  in the current fiscal year we recognized gains of  from the sale of cooperative apartment units 
in the prior fiscal year we recognized gains of  from the sale of a parcel of unimproved land that we previously acquired in foreclosure and from the sale of a cooperative apartment unit 
gain on the sale of available for sale securities was  in the fiscal year ended september  this gain resulted from the sale of several real estate investment trust securities  including the sale of  shares of entertainment properties trust 
there were no securities sales in the fiscal year ended september  liquidity and capital resources we are primarily engaged in the business of originating and holding for investment senior and junior real estate mortgages secured by real property 
our investment policy emphasizes short term mortgage loans 
we also purchase senior and junior participations in short term mortgage loans and originate participating mortgage loans and loans to joint ventures in which we are an equity participant 
from time to time we participate out senior  junior or pari passu positions in mortgage loans originated by us 
repayments of real estate loans in the amount of  are due during the twelve months ending september   including  due on demand 
the availability of mortgage financing secured by real property and the market for selling real estate is cyclical 
since these are the principal sources for the generation of funds by our borrowers to repay our outstanding real estate loans  we cannot project the portion of loans maturing during the next twelve months which will be paid or the portion of loans which will be extended for a fixed term or on a month to month basis 
we maintain a revolving credit facility with north fork bank 
the facility provides for borrowings up to  but no greater than of qualified first mortgage loans pledged to north fork bank 
we had  outstanding under this line as of september  and  of unused availability under this line as of september  we also have the ability to borrow on margin  using the shares we own in entertainment properties trust  or epr  as collateral 
at september   there was  outstanding of the approximately  available under this facility 
if the value of the epr shares were to decline  the available funds under the margin credit line might decline and we could be required to repay a portion or all of the margin loan 
during the twelve months ended september   we generated cash of  from operating activities   from the sale of securities   from collections from real estate loans and  from the sale of participations in loans originated by us 
these funds  in addition to cash on hand and funds borrowed under our revolving credit facility and our margin line of credit  were used primarily to fund real estate loan originations of  and to pay cash distributions to shareholders in the amount of  we will satisfy our liquidity needs in the year ending september  from cash and cash investments on hand  the credit facility with north fork bank  the availability in our margin account collateralized by the epr shares  interest and principal payments received on outstanding real estate loans  and net cash flow generated from the operation and sale of real estate assets 
disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth as of september  our known contractual obligations payment due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations      capital lease obligations operating lease obligation      purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on company balance sheet under gaap total      outlook the real estate business is cyclical and to a large extent depends upon  among other factors  national and local business and economic conditions  government economic policies and the level and volatility of interest rates 
a difficult or declining real estate market in the new york metropolitan area or in other parts of the country and a recessionary economy could potentially have the following adverse effects on our business i an increase in loan defaults which will result in decreased interest and fees on our outstanding real estate loans  an increase in loan loss reserves and an increase in expenses incurred in foreclosures and restructurings  ii a decrease in loan originations  and iii a decrease in rental income from properties owned by us or joint ventures in which we are a venture participant and an increase in operating expenses related to real estate properties 
however  a declining real estate market could also provide us with opportunities since  in a declining market  other lenders  particularly institutional lenders  become more conservative in their lending activities 
if such a lending environment should occur the amount of potential business for us could increase 
we are aware of the difficulties which could be encountered in a declining real estate environment 
we therefore monitor our mortgage portfolio for compliance by our borrowers 
since almost all of our loan portfolio provides for stated minimum or fixed interest rates  the current low interest rate environment  although negatively affecting our revenues and net income  has not had and should not have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 
cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code since our organization 
to qualify as a real estate investment trust  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently to our shareholders at least of our adjusted ordinary taxable income 
it is the current intention of our management to comply with these requirements and maintain our real estate investment trust status 
as a real estate investment trust  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a real estate investment trust for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a real estate investment trust  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income  ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder 
for tax purposes  we report on a calendar year basis as distinguished from financial reporting purposes for which we are on a september th fiscal year 
we distributed substantially all of our taxable income for calendar by october we estimate taxable income for calendar will be  of which approximately  is expected to represent capital gain income 
to comply with the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and the applicable regulations thereunder at least of the ordinary taxable income is required to be declared by september  and  assuming we continue to pay the quarterly dividends on or about the st day of each calendar quarter january st  april st  july st and october st distributed by october  it is our intention to pay to our shareholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code substantially all of our annual taxable income  including gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on sale of available for sale securities 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgments and estimates by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these significant accounting policies include allowance for possible losses we review our mortgage portfolio  real estate assets underlying our mortgage portfolio and owned by us and the real estate assets owned by joint ventures in which we are a venture partner on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there has been any impairment in the value of the real estate assets underlying our loans or any impairment in the value of any of such real estate assets in order to determine if there is a need for a provision for an allowance for possible losses against our real estate loans or an impairment allowance against real estate assets 
in reviewing the value of the collateral underlying our loan portfolio  our real estate assets  and the real estate assets owned by joint ventures  we seek to arrive at the fair value of the underlying collateral or such real estate on an individual basis by taking into account numerous factors including market evaluations of the underlying collateral or the real estate  estimated operating cash flow from the property during a projected holding period and an estimated sales value computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net operating income of the specific property  less selling costs  discounted at market discount rates 
each of these factors entails significant judgments and estimates 
real estate assets held for use and real estate assets owned by joint ventures are evaluated for indicators of impairment using an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
if that analysis suggests that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property will be insufficient to recover our investment  an impairment provision will be calculated based upon the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its fair value 
real estate assets which are held for sale are valued at the lower of the recorded cost or estimated fair value  less the cost to sell 
we do not obtain any independent appraisals of either the real property underlying our loans or the real estate assets which are held by us and by our joint ventures  but we rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any valuation allowances taken with respect to our loan portfolio or real estate assets will reduce our net income  assets and shareholders equity to the extent of the amount of the valuation allowance  but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold 
no additional valuation allowance was recorded against our mortgage portfolio in the fiscal year ended september  there was no valuation adjustment recorded in fiscal against real estate assets 
revenue recognition we recognize interest income and rental income on an accrual basis  unless we make a judgment that impairment of a loan or loans or of real estate owned renders doubtful collection of interest or rent in accordance with the applicable loan documents or leases 
in making a judgment as to the collectibility of interest or rent  we consider  among other factors  the status of the loan or property  the borrower s or tenant s financial condition  payment history and anticipated events in the future 
income recognition is suspended for loans when in the opinion of management a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful 
income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and continued performance is demonstrated 
accordingly  management must make a significant judgment as to whether to treat a loan or real estate owned as impaired 
if we make a decision to treat a problem loan or real estate asset as unimpaired and therefore continue to recognize the interest and rent as income on an accrual basis  we could overstate income by recognizing income that will not be collected and the uncollectible amount will ultimately have to be written off 
the period in which the uncollectible amount is written off could adversely affect taxable income for a specific year and our ability to pay cash distributions 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary component of market risk is interest rate sensitivity 
our interest income and to a lesser extent our interest expense are subject to changes in interest rates 
we seek to minimize these risks by originating loans that are indexed to the prime rate  with a stated minimum interest rate  and borrowing  when necessary  from our available credit line which is also indexed to the prime rate 
at september   approximately of our portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans tied primarily to the prime rate 
changes in the prime interest rate would affect our net interest income accordingly 
when determining interest rate sensitivity  we assume that any change in interest rates is immediate and that the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of the period remain constant over the period being measured 
we assessed the market risk for our variable rate mortgage receivables and variable rate debt and believe that a one percent increase in interest rates would cause an increase of income before taxes of  and a one percent decline in interest rates would cause an increase of income before taxes of approximately  in addition  we originate loans with short maturities and maintain a strong capital position 
as of september   a majority of our loan portfolio was secured primarily by properties located in the new york metropolitan area  including new jersey and connecticut  in tennessee  and in florida and it is therefore subject to risks associated with the economies of these localities
