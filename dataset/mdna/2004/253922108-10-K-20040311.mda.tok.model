item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the holding company s primary business is the operation of the bank 
the company s consolidated results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank additionally generates non interest income such as service charges and other fees and income associated with the bank s purchase of bank owned life insurance boli 
non interest expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  federal deposit insurance premiums  data processing fees  marketing expenses and other operating expenses 
the company s consolidated results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions particularly fluct uations in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies 
the bank s primary strategy is to increase its household and deposit market shares in the communities that it serves  either through direct marketing  acquisitions or purchases of deposits 
the bank also seeks to increase its product and service utilization for each individual depositor 
in addition  the bank s primary strategy includes the origination of  and investment in  mortgage loans  with an emphasis on multi family residential loans secured by mixed use properties that are classified as either multi family residential or commercial real estate loans based upon the income characteristics of the underlying collateral property 
multi family residential lending is a significant business of the bank  reflecting the fact that much of the housing in its primary lending area is multi family 
recently we have had success in increasing our portfolio of loans secured by mixed use properties that are classified as commercial real estate loans  typified by commercial units on ground level and residential apartment units on upper floors 
we believe that multi family residential and commercial real estate loans provide advantages as investment assets 
initially  they offer a higher yield than one to four family loans or investment securities of comparable maturities or terms to repricing 
origination and processing costs for the bank s multi family residential and commercial real estate loans are lower per thousand dollars of originations than comparable one to four family loan costs 
in addition  the bank s market area generally has provided a stable flow of new and refinanced multi family residential and commercial real estate loan originations 
in order to address the higher credit risk associated with multi family residential and commercial real estate lending  the bank has developed underwriting standards that it believes are reliable in order to maintain consistent credit quality for its loans 
the bank also strives to provide a stable source of liquidity and earnings through the purchase of investment grade securities  seeks to maintain the asset quality of its loans and other investments  and uses appropriate portfolio and asset liability management techniques in an effort to manage the effects of interest rate volatility on its profitability and capital 
in  we experienced modest growth in assets  primarily in mbs available for sale and commercial real estate loans secured by mixed use properties 
increases in real estate loan origination levels were driven by the continuation of the low interest rate environment during this environment also resulted in an increase in principal repayments on loans and mbs resulting from increased customer refinance activities 
deposits grew in due to the success of various sales and marketing activities during the period  primarily for money ma rket accounts  while we continued to manage our cost of funds by prepaying higher cost repos 
during we experienced an increase in net interest income attributable to a decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities as a result of a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities away from higher cost borrowings towards lower cost cds  money market and other deposit accounts  and a decline in the average cost of borrowed funds due to general declines in interest rates during the period 
the decline in interest rates  particularly long term rates between october and june  also reduced the average yield on real estate loans and mbs as these assets repriced in the lower rate environment that prevailed throughout the year 
the bank s general policy has been to emphasize growth in real estate loans as its primary interest earning asset  and de emphasize its investment and mbs portfolios while loan origination demand is strong 
however  as part of a specific investment strategy to achieve a desirable balance of yield and liquidity on short term investments in the prevailing interest rate environment  the bank purchased mbs during resulting in an increase in the average balance of the portfolio which helped to partially offset the impact of the lower yields in the prevailing environment 
we also benefited from increased prepayment fee income  as a result of prepayments related to the low interest rate environment 
we have positioned ourselves for a potential turn in interest rates by not fully deploying our strong capital position in the historically low interest rate environment of we would expect a controlled deployment of our capital should interest rates rise steadily  though we could experience some pressure on our net interest income should rates rise rapidly

critical accounting policies note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the company 
various elements of the company s accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
the company s policies with respect to the methodologies it uses to determine the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and asset impairment judgments including the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and other than temporary declines in the value of securities  and loan income recognition are the company s most critical accounting policies because they are important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and involve a high degree of complexity and require managemen t to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the following is a description of the company s critical accounting policies and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying their application 
these critical policies and their application are reviewed periodically and at least annually with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
allowance for loan losses 
the loan loss reserve methodology consists of several key components  including a review of the two elements of the bank s loan portfolio  classified loans ie non performing loans  troubled debt restructuring and impaired loans under amended sfas and performing loans 
at december   the majority of the allowance for loan losses was allocated to performing loans  which represented the overwhelming majority of the bank s loan portfolio 
performing loans are reviewed at least quarterly based upon the premise that there are losses inherent within the loan portfolio that have not been identified as of the balance sheet date 
as a result  the bank calculates an allowance for loan losses related to its performing loans by deriving an expected loan loss percentage and applying it to its performing loans 
in deriving the expected loan loss percentage  the bank considers the following criteria the bank s historical loss experience  the age and payment history of the loans commonly referred to as their seasoned quality  the type of loan ie  one to four family  multi family residential  commercial real estate  cooperative apartment or consumer  the underwriting history of the loan ie  whether it was underwritten by the bank or a predecessor institution acquired subsequently by the bank and  therefore  originally subjected to different underwriting criteria  both the current condition and recent history of the overall local real estate market in order to determine the accuracy of utilizing recent historical charge off data in order to derive the expected loan loss percentages  the level of and trend in non performing loans  the level and composition of new loan activity  and the existence of geographic loan concentrations as the overwhelming majority of the bank s loans are secured by real estate properties located in the new york city metropolitan area or specific industry conditions within the portfolio segments 
since these criteria effect the expected loan loss percentages that are applied to performing loans  changes in any one or more of these criteria will effect the amount of the allowance and the provision for loan losses 
the bank applied the process of determining the allowance for loan losses consistently throughout the year ended december   the six months ended december  and the t welve months ended june  and loans classified as special mention  substandard or doubtful are reviewed individually on a quarterly basis by the loan loss reserve committee to determine if specific reserves are appropriate 
under the guidance established by amended sfas  loans determined to be impaired are evaluated in order to establish whether the estimated value of the underlying collateral determined from independent appraisals is sufficient to satisfy the existing debt 
for each loan that the bank determines to be impaired  impairment is measured by the amount that the carrying balance of the loan  including all accrued interest  exceeds the estimate of its fair value 
a specific reserve is established on all impaired loans to the extent of impairment and comprises a portion of the allowance for loan losses 
generally  the bank considers non performing and troubled debt restructured multi family residential and commercial real estate loans  along with non performing one to four family loans exceeding  to be impaired 
non performing one to four family loans of  or less are considered homogeneous loan pools and are not required to be evaluated for impairment 
there were no impaired loans at december  the recorded investment in loans deemed impaired was approximately  consisting of one loan  at december  the average total balance of impaired loans was approximately  during the year ended december    during the six months ended december   and million and million during the years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease in both the current and average balance of impaired loans resulted primarily from the repayment in june of an impaired million troubled debt restructured loan 
at both december  and  there were no reserves allocated within the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans 
if approved by the board of directors  the bank will additionally increase its valuation allowance in an amount recommended by the loan loss reserve committee to appropriately reflect the anticipated loss from any other loss classification category 
typically  the bank s policy is to charge off immediately all balances classified loss and all charge offs are recorded as a reduction of the allowance for loan losses 
the bank applied this process consistently throughout the year ended december   the six months ended december  and the twelve months ended june  and the loan loss reserve committee s determination of the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral is subject to assumptions and judgments made by the committee 
a specific valuation allowance could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments 
although management believes that the bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels  subsequent adjustments may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current operating environment 
although the bank utilizes the most reliable information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate subject to significant judgment and short term change 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses  its valuation of oreo  and the level of loans both in  and pending  foreclosure 
based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  the regulators may require the bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance 
these evaluations are inherently subjective because  even though they are based upon objective data  it is management s interpretation of that data that determines the amount of the appropriate allowance 
therefore  the company periodically reviews the actual performance and charge off of its portfolio and compares that to the previously determined allowance coverage percentages 
in doing so  the company evaluates the impact that the previously mentioned variables may have on the portfolio to determine which changes  if any  should be made to the assumptions and analyses 
as indicated above  actual results could differ from the company s estimates as a result of changes in economic or market conditions 
changes in estimates could result in a material change in the allowance for loan losses 
while the company believes that the allowance for loan losses has been established and maintained at levels adequate to reflect the risks inherent in its loan portfolio  future increases may be necessary if the economic or market conditions decline substantially from the conditions that existed at the time of the initial determination 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights msr 
the estimated origination and servicing cost of mortgage loans sold in which servicing rights are retained  is allocated between the loans and the servicing rights based on their estimated fair values at the time of loan sale 
servicing assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  net servicing income 
the estimated fair value of loan servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows  using assumptions of prepayments  defaults  servicing costs and discount rates that the company believes market participants would use for similar assets 
capitalized loan servicing assets are stratified based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans for the purpose of evaluating impairment 
a valuation allowance is then established in the event the recorded value of an individual stratum exceeds fair value 
all estimates and assumptions utilized in the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights are derived based upon actual historical results for either the bank or its industry peers 
the fair value of the msr is sensitive to changes in assumptions 
fluctuations in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of the msr 
in the event that loan prepayment activities increase due to increased loan refinancing  the fair value of the msr would likely decline 
in the event that loan prepayment activities decrease due to a decline in loan refinancing  the fair value of the msr would likely increase 
any measurement of the msr is limited by the existing conditions and assumptions utilized at a particular point in time  and would not necessarily be appropriate if they were applied at a different point in time 
asset impairment adjustments including valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and other than temporary declines in value of securities 
certain of the company s assets are carried in its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets 
management of the company periodically performs analyses to test for impairment of these assets 
in addition to these impairment analyses related to loans and msr discussed above  two other significant impairment analyses relate to the value of goodwill and other than temporary declines in the value of the company s securities 
goodwill is accounted for in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which was adopted on july  sfas eliminated amortization of goodwill and instead requires that an annual impairment test be performed annually at the reporting unit level 
as of the date of adoption of sfas  and as of december   the company had goodwill totaling million 
prior to adoption of sfas  annual goodwill amortization expense totaled million 
for purposes of its goodwill impairment testing  the company identified a single reporting unit 
the impairment test is therefore performed on a consolidated basis and compares the company s market capitalization reporting unit fair value to its outstanding equity reporting unit carrying value 
in accordance with the recommended provisions of sfas  the company utilizes its closing stock price as reported on the nasdaq national market on the date of the impairment test in order to compute market capitalization 
the company has designated the last day of its fiscal year as the annual date for impairment testing 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december  and concluded that no potential impairment of goodwill existed since the fair value of the company s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
no events have occurred  nor circumstances changed subsequent to december   that would reduce the fair value of the company s reporting unit below its carrying value 
such events or changes in circumstances would require an immediate impairment test to be performed in accordance with sfas differences in the identification of reporting units and the use of valuation techniques can result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
debt and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value unless they are held to maturity 
estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values 
debt securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost only if the company has a positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
if not classified as held to maturity  such securities are classified as securities available for sale or as trading securities 
unrealized holding gains or losses on securities available for sale are excluded from net income and reported net of income taxes as other comprehensive income 
the company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of its securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other than temporary 
if such decline is dee med other than temporary  the carrying amount of the security is adjusted through a valuation allowance 
for the periods ended december   december   june  and june   there were no other than temporary impairments in the securities portfolio 
loan income recognition 
interest income on loans is recorded using the level yield method 
under this method  discount accretion and premium amortization are included in interest income 
loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized as a yield adjustment over the contractual loan terms 
accrual of interest is discontinued when its receipt is in doubt  which typically occurs when a loan becomes days past due as to principal or interest 
when interest accruals are discontinued  any interest accrued to income in the current year is reversed 
payments on nonaccrual loans are generally applied to principal 
management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when a loan is in the process of collection and the estimated fair value of the collateral is sufficient to cover the principal balance and accrued interest 
loans are returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectibility has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated performance in accordance with the loan terms and conditions 
liquidity and capital resources the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  mbs and investments  borrowings  and proceeds from the sale of multi family residential loans to fnma  and fixed rate  one to four family mortgage loans to the secondary mortgage market 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investments are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and prepayments on mortgage loans and mbs are influenced by interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank gathers deposits in direct competition with commercial banks  savings banks and brokerage firms  many among the largest in the nation 
in addition  it must also compete for deposit monies against the stock markets and mutual funds  especially during periods of strong performance in the us equity markets 
the bank s deposit flows are affected primarily by the pricing and marketing of its deposit products compared to its competitors  as well as the market performance of depositor investment alternatives such as the us bond or equity markets 
to the extent that the bank is responsive to general increases or declines in interest rates  the company s deposit flows should not be materially impacted 
the successful performance of the us equity markets could adversely impact the company s deposit flows 
deposits increased million during the year ended december   million during the six months ended december   million during the year ended june   and million during the year ended june  the increase in deposits during each of these periods reflected increased marketing efforts that helped generate additional deposit balances in cds and core deposit accounts 
the increase was also partially attributable to a consumer trend to move monies out of the equity markets and into deposit accounts during the period 
during the six months ended december   a successful campaign that attracted longer term cds resulted in growth in cds of million 
otherwise  money market accounts realized the greatest growth during these periods  increasing million during the year ended december   million during the six months ended december   million during the year ended june   and million during the year ended june  the additional level of deposit growth during the year ended june  reflected an extension of the successful promotional deposit activities engaged in during the twelve months ended june   particularly money market deposit promotions 
in addition  the twelve months ended june  saw the establishment of two de novo branch offices  which gathered approximately million in deposits as of june  cds scheduled to mature in one year or less from december  totaled million 
based upon the bank s current pricing strategy and deposit retention experience  management believes that the bank will retain a significant portion of such deposits 
during the year ended december   principal repayments on real estate loans totaled million and principal repayments on mbs totaled million 
during the year ended december   principal repayments on real estate loans totaled million and principal repayments on mbs totaled million 
the increase in principal repayments on loans and mbs resulted from added customer refinance activities associated with the continued level of low  long term interest rates during the period january  through december   as well as a decline in long term interest rates during the period october through june maturities and calls of investment securities totaled million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  during the period january  through december   the company and bank experienced a n increased level of call activity on their investment securities due to the reduction in market interest rates 
increases in long term rates during the second half of did not significantly impact the level of prepayments or origination levels that previously existed during the bank implemented a program in december to originate and sell multi family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to fnma while retaining servicing 
the bank underwrites these loans using its customary underwriting standards  funds the loans  and sells them to fnma at agreed upon pricing 
typically  the bank seeks to sell loans with terms to maturity or repricing in excess of five years from the origination date 
during the years ended december  and  respectively  the bank sold million and million of loans pursuant to this program 
under the terms of the sales program  the bank retains a portion of the associated credit risk 
once established  such amount would continue to increase as long as the bank continues to sell loans under this program to fnma 
the bank retains this level of exposure until the portfolio of loans are paid in entirety or the bank funds cla ims by fnma for the maximum loss exposure 
during the years ended december  and  repos declined million and million  respectively on a net basis and fhlbny advances declined million and million on a net basis 
during the years ended december  and  management elected to prepay million and million of short and medium term repos and fhlbny advances 
during the year ended december   a portion of these prepaid borrowings were replaced with longer term fhlbny advances possessing a lower average interest cost 
during the year ended december   none of the prepaid borrowings were replaced 
as of december   there were million in borrowings due to mature or reprice within one year  the majority of which are obligations of the bank 
the bank s primary uses of liquidity and capital resources are the origination of real estate loans and the purchase of mortgage backed and other securities 
during the years ended december  and  real estate loan originations totaled billion and million  respectively 
a continued level of low  long term interest rates during the period january through december contributed to an increase in origination activity during the year ended december  purchases of investment securities and mbs  which were million during the year ended december   totaled million for the year ended december  the increase in purchase activity during the year ended december  reflected both the replacement of mbs amortization during the period and the acquisition of a greater volume of short term and medium term securities that will likely be re invested in real estate loans in the event that long term interest rates rise 
during the year ended december   the holding company purchased  shares of its common stock into treasury 
all shares were recorded at their respective acquisition cost  which totaled million during the year ended december  as of december   up to  shares remained available for purchase under authorized share purchase programs 
based upon the closing price of its common stock of per share as of december   the holding company would utilize million in funds in order to purchase all of these remaining authorized shares 
for the holding company to complete these share purchases  it will likely require dividend distributions from the bank 
the levels of the bank s short term liquid assets are dependent on its operating  financing and investing activities during any given period 
the bank monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis 
during the year ended december   the bank experienced increased liquidity resulting from deposit growth  as well as higher levels of real estate loan and mbs prepayments and the sale of loans to fnma 
as of december   a portion of these funds had not been used to fund loan originations or other investment activities 
temporary excess liquidity is invested in overnight federal funds sales and various money market investments 
in the event that the bank should require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available through use of its borrowing line at the fhlbny 
at december   the bank had an additional potential borrowing capacity of million available should it purchase the minimum required level of fhlbny common stock of th of its outstanding fhlbny borrowings 
the bank is subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by the ots  which requirements are  as a general matter  based on the amount and composition of an institution s assets 
at december   the bank was in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements 
in addition  at december   the bank was considered well capitalized for all regulatory purposes see item business regulation regulation of federal savings associations capital requirements 
the company s ratio of stockholders equity to total assets was and  respectively  ay december  and contractual obligations the bank has outstanding at any time  a significant number of borrowings in the form of fhlbny advances or repos 
the holding company also has an outstanding non callable subordinated note payable of million due to mature in the bank is obligated under leases for certain rental payments due on its branches and equipment 
a summary of borrowings and lease obligations at december  is as follows less than one year one year to three years over three years to five years over five years total at december  dollars in thousands borrowings including subordinated note payable operating lease obligations off balance sheet arrangements the bank has outstanding commitments to extend credit to third parties  which are subject to strict credit control assessments 
since many of these loan commitments expire without being funded in whole or part  the contract amounts are not estimates of future cash flows 
less than one year one year to three years over three years to five years over five years total at december  dollars in thousands credit commitments available lines of credit other loan commitments total credit commitments analysis of net interest income the company s profitability  like that of most financial institutions  is dependent to a significant extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earnings assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits or borrowings 
net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following tables set forth certain information relating to the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and the unaudited year ended december   the six months ended december  and the unaudited six months ended december   and the years ended june  and  and reflect the average yield on interest earning assets and average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing interest income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods indicated

assets totaled billion at december   an increase of million from total assets of billion at december  the growth in assets was experienced primarily in mbs available for sale and real estate loans  which increased million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   the bank purchased million of mbs available for sale 
these purchases were intended to provide both current additional yield over short term investments as well as liquidity to the bank in future quarters when it may seek to deploy funds into higher yielding investments 
partially offsetting these purchases were mbs principal repayments of million and sales of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the bank experienced above average levels of principal repayments on mbs availabl e for sale 
these repayments were driven by above average mortgage refinancing activity during the period  which resulted from the continued low level of interest rates during the period january through december in addition to growth in mbs available for sale  real estate loans increased million during the year ended december  the majority of this growth was achieved in mixed use properties that are classified as commercial real estate loans 
during the period  total real estate loan originations totaled billion  of which billion were multi family residential and commercial real estate loans 
the majority of the bank s multi family originations were retained in its portfolio 
real estate loan origination levels were driven by the continuation of the low interest rate environment during the period january through december offsetting the growth in real estate loan originations were increases in principal prepayment levels during the year ended december  attributable to the low level of long term interest rates during principal repayments  which include both regular amortization and prepayments  totaled million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  investment securities available for sale declined million during the year ended december  due to maturities and calls of these securities during the period resulting from the continued low interest rate environment 
purchases of investment securities available for sale were immaterial during the year ended december  liabilities 
total liabilities increased million during the year ended december  deposits grew million due to the success of various sales and marketing activities during the period  primarily for money market accounts 
during the year ended december   successful promotional campaigns resulted in growth in money markets of million  which was partially offset by a decline of million in cd s  as higher rate promotional cd s that were maturing were not renewed during the year 
during the year ended december   repos declined million  while fhlbny advances declined million 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million during the year ended december   due to the addition of net income of million  the increase to equity of million related to the issuance of stock for the exercise of stock options and tax benefits associated with the company s stock option plans and the recognition and retention plan rrp  and the increase to equity of million related to the amortization of the employee stock ownership plan of dime community bancshares  inc and affiliates esop and rrp 
both the esop and rrp have investments in the holding company s common stock that are recorded as reductions in stockholders equity contra equity balances 
as compensation expense is recognized on the esop and rrp  the contra equity balances are reduced  resulting in an increase to their respective equity balances 
t his increase to equity offsets the decline in the company s retained earnings related to the periodic esop and rrp expenses that are recorded 
all of the aforementioned increases to equity during the year ended december  were substantially offset by treasury stock purchases of million  cash dividends of million paid to shareholders and purchases of stock by the benefit maintenance plan of dime community bancshares  inc bmp and rrp of million during the same period  and a decline in the unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities component of other comprehensive income of million reflecting the general low level of interest rates 
comparison of financial condition at december  and june  assets 
assets totaled billion at december   an increase of million from total assets of billion at june  the growth in assets was experienced primarily in mbs available for sale and real estate loans  which increased million and million  respectively 
during the six months ended december   the bank purchased million of mbs available for sale 
these purchases were intended to provide additional yield currently over short term investments while providing liquidity to the bank in future quarters when it may seek to deploy funds into higher yielding investments 
partially offsetting these purchases were principal repayments of million during the six months ended december  during the six months ended december   the bank experienced above average levels of principal repayments on mbs available for sale 
nb sp  these repayments were driven by above average mortgage refinancing activity during the period  which resulted from the continued low level of interest rates during the period july through december in addition to growth in mbs available for sale  real estate loans increased million during the six months ended december  during the six months ended december   real estate loan originations totaled million  of which million were multi family residential and commercial real estate loans 
approximately of these multi family originations were retained in the bank s portfolio 
real estate loan origination levels were driven by the continuation of the low interest rate environment during the period july through december offsetting the growth in real estate loans from originations were increases in principal prepayment levels during the six months ended december  that resulted from the continued low level of long term interest rates during principal repayments  which include both regular amortization and prepayments  totaled million during the six months ended december  as compared to million during the six months ended december   and remained strong during the period january through december as a result of increased loan refinance activity driven by low interest rates 
federal funds sold and other short term investments increased million during the six months ended december   due to increased liquidity resulting from higher levels of real estate loan and mbs prepayments  as well as deposit growth during the period 
as of december   this increased liquidity had not been used to fund loan originations or other investment activities 
other assets increased million during the six months ended december   due primarily to an increase of million of prepaid pension benefits  as the bank satisfied all funding obligations for its employee pension plan during the period 
liabilities 
total liabilities increased million during the six months ended december  deposits grew million due to the success of various sales and marketing activities during the period  as well as an apparent consumer trend to move monies out of the equity markets and into deposit accounts 
cds increased million during the six months ended december  due to successful promotional campaigns 
in addition  escrow and other deposits decreased million during the period due to increased funding for real estate taxes 
during the six months ended december   repos declined million  and fhlbny advances declined million 
see liquidity and capital resources 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million during the six months ended december   due to the addition of net income of million  the increase to equity of million related to exercises and tax benefits associated with the company s stock option plans and rrp  and the increase to equity of million related to the amortization of the esop and rrp 
both the esop and rrp have investments in the holding company s common stock that are recorded as reductions in stockholders equity contra equity balances 
as compensation expense is recognized on the esop and rrp  the contra equity balances are reduced  resulting in an increase to total equity 
all of the aforementioned increases to equity during the six months ended december  were partially offset by treasury stock purchases of million and cash dividends of million paid to shareholders during the same period 
comparison of the operating results for the year ended december  and the unaudited year ended december  general 
net income was million during the year ended december   an increase of million over net income of million during the year ended december  during this comparative period  net interest income increased million  non interest income increased million and non interest expense increased million  resulting in increased pre tax income of million 
income tax expense increased million as a result of the increased pre tax income 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  increased million  to million  from million during the year ended december  the increase was attributable to a decline of million in interest expense that was partially offset by a decline of million in interest income during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net interest spread increased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   and the net interest margin increased basis points from to during the same period 
the increase in both the net interest spread and net interest margin reflected a basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities as a result of a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities away from higher cost borrowings towards lower cost cds  money market and other deposit accounts  and a decline of basis points in the average cost of borrowed funds basis points excluding prepayment expenses of million and million  respectively  incurred during the years ended december  and 
borrowing costs declined during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to declines in short term and medium term interest rates during and during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the average balance of deposits  including non interest bearing checking accounts  increased as a result of ongoing deposit marketing promotions and customer sales activities 
in addition  the average balance of real estate loans increased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and the average rate on real estate loans was typically less susceptible to reductions in interest rates than other interest earning assets since real estate loans possess a longer average term to their maturity or next interest rate reset 
interest income 
interest income was million during the year ended december   a decrease of million from million during the year ended december  interest income on real estate loans and investment securities declined million and million  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these declines were partially offset by an increase in interest income on mbs of million during the same period 
the decline in interest income on real estate loans during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was attributable to a decrease of basis points in average yield during the period that resulted from the reduction in long term interest rates from october to june this decline in interest rates stimulated the refinancing and prepayment of higher rate loans in the bank s portfolio  while also resulting in reduced rates on existing portfolio loans that repriced during the period october  to december  partially offsetting the decline in interest income on real estate loans resulting from reductions in yield was an increase in interest income resulting from the increased average balance of real estate loans of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   re al estate loan originations totaled billion  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of declines in long term interest rates experienced during the period which stimulated a wave of mortgage refinancing activities and contributed to higher property values and average loan origination amounts 
the bank s general policy has been to emphasize growth in real estate loans as its primary interest earning asset  and de emphasize its investment and mbs portfolios while loan origination demand is strong 
however  as part of a specific investment strategy to achieve a desirable balance of yield and liquidity on short term investments in the prevailing interest rate environment  the bank purchased million of mbs during the year ended december  this purchase level exceeded the level of mbs principal repayments of million and sales of million during the same period 
this resulted in an overall increase of million in the average balance of mbs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  however  due to the continuation of low interest rates during the period october  through december   the average yield on mbs declin ed from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  the combination of these factors resulted in a net increase in interest income on mbs of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest income on investment securities declined million as a result of a decline of million in average balance during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and a reduction of basis points in the average yield on these securities during the same period 
the decline in average balance reflects maturity and call activity experienced on these securities as a result of the lower interest rate environment during the period january  through december  the decline in average yield reflects the decline in interest rates during the period january  through december   as higher coupon securities were called from the portfolio 
interest income on other short term investments decreased  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decline reflects the continued low level of short term interest rates during  as well as the decision by the fhlbny not to pay a cash dividend to its shareholders during the quarter ended december   which resulted in a loss of approximately  of interest income by the company 
overall  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  the continuation of low interest rates during the period january  through december  resulted in reductions in the average yield on mbs of basis points and investment securities of basis points during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the yield on real estate loans declined by basis points during this period 
interest expense 
interest expense declined million  to million  during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the decline in interest expense resulted primarily from a reduction of million in interest expense on borrowed funds  which resulted from declines of million in the average balance of borrowed funds and basis points in the average cost of borrowed funds during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december during the twelve months ended december   the company prepaid million of borrowed funds  primarily higher cost repos  resulting in prepayment fees of million being added to interest expense during the year ended december  during the twelve months ended december   the company prepaid million of borrowed funds  primarily securities sold under agreement to repurchase borrowings  resulting in prepayment fees of million being added to interest expense during the year ended december  these prepayments of borrowings resulted in the significant reduction in both average balance and average cost of borrowings during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the average cost of cds  the next largest component of interest expense  declined by basis points  resulting in a reduction in interest expense of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the average cost of money market accounts and savings accounts declined by basis points and basis points  respectively  during the same period  resulting in a reduction in interest cost of million and million  respectively 
these declines in average cost all reflected reductions in interest rates offered by the bank as a result of the overall interest rate environment in effect during the period january through december substantially offsetting the declines in interest cost of cds  money market accounts and savings accounts that resulted from reduced average costs was increased interest expense associated with increased average balances of million in cds  million in money market accounts and million in savings accounts during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these increased average balances reflected successful deposit gathering promotions of the bank during the period january  to december  provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  during the year ended december  and  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company added  to its loan loss provision related to expected losses on real estate loans  and  to its loan loss provision related to expected losses on consumer loans see item business allowance for loan losses 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  to million  during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   a net loss on the sale of mbs and other short term investments totaled million 
during the year ended december   net gains on sales of equity investment securities totaled million 
during the years ended december  and  the bank recorded net gains of million and million  respectively  on the sale of loans  primarily from the sale of multi family residential loans to fnma 
service charges and other fees increased million due primarily to increased fees on loans and deposits that resulted from both increased loan origination and attendant servicing as a result of the low interest rate environment and growth in deposit households as a result of ongoing deposit product promotions 
other non interest income increased million due to increased prepayment fee income of million  as a result of prepayments related to the low interest rate environment 
non interest expense 
non interest expense was million during the year ended december   an increase of million over the year ended december  salary and employee benefits increased  during the period due to general salary and staffing increases during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in addition  the increase in the average price of the company s common stock during the year ended december  resulted in increased esop expense of  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by a decrease of  of expense associated with the rrp for which the final vesting of the original grant of  shares concluded during occupancy and equipment expense increased  during the comparative period due primarily to a renovation program on existing branches that was not eligible to be capitalized  as well as from a full year of expenses due to the addition of the glen oaks branch  which commenced operations near the end of the june  and the bay ridge branch  which commenced operations in march data processing costs increased  during the comparative period due to additional systems activity related to growth in the loan portfolio and additional deposit activity 
management of the company continues to remain focused upon controlling operating costs  and expects this trend to continue during income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to an increase of million in pre tax net income 
comparison of operating results for the six months ended december  and the unaudited six months ended december  general 
net income was million during the six months ended december   an increase of million over net income of million during the six months ended december  during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december   net interest income increased million  non interest income increased million and non interest expense increased million  resulting in increased pre tax income of million 
income tax expense increased million as a result of the increased pre tax income 
net interest income 
net interest income for the six months ended december  increased million to million from million during the six months ended december  this increase was attributable to a decline of million in interest expense that was partially offset by a decline of million in interest income during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  the net interest spread increased basis points from for the six months ended december  to for the six months ended december   and the net interest margin increased basis points from to during the same period 
the increase in both the net interest spread and net interest margin reflected a basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  as well as a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities away from higher cost borrowings and towards lower cost money market and other deposit accounts 
during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december   the average balance of deposits  including non interest bearing checking accounts  increased as a result of ongoing deposit marketing promotions and customer sales activities 
in addition  the average balance of real estate loans increased during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december   and the average rate on real estate loans was less susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates than other interest earning assets since real estate loans possess a long er average term to their maturity or next interest rate reset 
during the period january through december  the overnight inter bank borrowing rate declined on eleven different occasions  moving from an initial rate of to an ending rate of 
during the period january through october  the overnight inter bank borrowing rate remained constant at 
in november  the overnight inter bank borrowing rate declined to 
because the bank s liabilities generally possess a shorter average term to maturity than its assets  the net interest margin and net interest spread both benefited from the reductions in interest rates during a significant portion of the benefit of liabilities repricing to lower rates was realized during the period january through december  interest income 
interest income was million during the six months ended december   a decrease of million from million during the six months ended december  declines in interest income on mbs of million and on other short term investments of  during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  were partially offset by an increase in interest income on real estate loans of million during the same period 
the bank s general policy has been to emphasize growth in real estate loans as its primary interest earning asset  and de emphasize its investment and mbs portfolios while loan origination demand is strong 
consistent with this policy  total principal repayments on mbs exceeded net purchases of mbs by million during the period october  through june  however  as part of a specific investment strategy to achieve a desirable balance of yield and liquidity on short term investments  the bank purchased million of mbs during the six months ended december  this purchase level exceeded the level of principal repayments of million during the same period 
the combination of all activity during the period october through december resulted in an overall decline of million in the average balance of mbs during the six months ended december  compared t o the six months ended december  in addition  due to short term interest rate reductions during the period january through december  and the continuation of low short term interest rates during the period january  through december   the average yield on mbs declined from during the six months ended december  to during the six months ended december  the decline of  in interest income on short term investments resulted from a decrease of basis points in average yield on these investments  reflecting gradual reductions in interest rates during the period january through december and in late the decline in yields on these investments more than offset the increase in interest income that would have otherwise resulted from growth in their average balance of million during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  growth in average balance during the period reflected increased liquid funds generated during the period january through december from both deposit growth and higher real estate loan and mbs principal repayments 
the increase in interest income on real estate loans was attributable to an increase of million in the average balance of real estate loans resulting from real estate loan originations during the period january  through december  during the six months ended december  and  real estate loan originations totaled million and million  respectively 
loan originations increased during the six months ended december  as a result of declines in long term interest rates experienced during the period which stimulated a wave of mortgage refinancing activities and contributed to higher property values and average loan origination amounts 
overall  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points from during the six months ended december  to during the six months ended december  declines in the overnight inter bank borrowing rate brought about by the actions of the fomc during the period january through december  along with the continuation of low interest rates during the period january  through december   contributed to general decreases in interest rates  resulting in reductions in the average yield on mbs of basis points  on investment securities of basis points and on other short term investments of basis points during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  the yield on real estate loans declined by only basis points during this period 
real estate loans possess longer terms to maturity or interest rate repri cing and  therefore  reacted slower than other interest earning assets to the declines in long term interest rates during the six months ended december  interest expense 
interest expense declined million  to million during the six months ended december   from million during the six months ended december  the decline in interest expense resulted substantially from a reduction of million in interest expense on borrowed funds  which resulted from a decline of million in the average balance of borrowed funds during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  the average cost of cds  the next largest component of interest expense  declined by basis points  resulting in a reduction in interest expense of million during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  the average cost of money market accounts and savings accounts also declined by basis points and basis points  respectively  during t he same period  resulting in a reduction in interest cost of  and million  respectively 
these declines in average cost all reflected reductions in interest rates offered by the bank as a result of the overall interest rate environment in effect during the period january through december provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  during both the six months ended december  and see item business allowance for loan losses 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million to million during the six months ended december   from million during the six months ended december  the increase resulted primarily from increased prepayment fee income included in other non interest income of million  as loan prepayments increased during the period due to both declines in interest rates during the period january through december and continued low interest rates during the period january through december in addition  fee income grew  due primarily to additional loan fees of  resulting from increased origination activity  and an increase of  in deposit customer fees resulting from growth in deposit activity 
under the terms of an agreement entered into in december  the bank sold approximately million of recently originated multi family residential loans to fnma during december  recording a pre tax gain of million on these loan sales 
otherwise  gains and losses on the sale of assets were immaterial during the six months ended december  and non interest expense 
non interest expense was million during the six months ended december   an increase of million over the six months ended december  salary and employee benefits increased million during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december   as a result of increased salaries and staffing during the twelve months ended december   reflecting growth in personnel added to satisfy needs created by the increased size of the bank  as well as growth in loans and deposit balances  and added deposit products during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  the benefit cost associated with the bmp increased million during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  due to the accelerated expense accruals of month expenses over a month period 
the accelerated expense accruals resulted from a change in expense accrual methodology resulting from the company s change in fiscal year end from june th to december st 
the benefit costs associated with the esop  which are calculated based upon the average market value of the holding company s common stock  additionally increased  due to an increase in the average market value of the holding company s common stock during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  data processing costs increased  during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december   due to additional systems activity related to growth in the loan portfolio and additional deposit activity 
other expenses increased  during the period due primarily to growth in advertising expenses of  as well as an increase in administrative costs totaling approximately  associated with the change in fiscal year end and six month report period ending december  income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million during the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december   due primarily to an increase of million in pre tax net income 
comparison of operating results for the years ended june  and general 
net income was million during the year ended june   an increase of million over net income of million during the year ended june  during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   net interest income increased million  the provision for loan losses declined  non interest income increased million and non interest expense increased  resulting in increased pre tax income of million 
goodwill amortization  which was million during the year ended june   was eliminated during the year ended june  pursuant to the adoption of sfas effective july   partially offsetting an increase of million in non interest expense 
income tax expense increased million as a result of the increased pre tax income 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended june  increased million to million from million during the year ended june  this growth was attributable to both an increase of million in interest income and a decline of million in interest expense during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the net interest spread increased basis points from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   and the net interest margin increased basis points from to during the same period 
the increase in net interest spread and net interest margin both reflected a basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  as well as a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities away from higher cost borrowings and towards lower cost money market and other deposit accounts 
during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   the average balance of deposits  including non interest bearing checking accounts  increased as a result of ongoing deposit marketing promotions and customer sales activities 
in addition  the average balance of real estate loans increased during the twelve months ended june   and the average rate on real estate loans was less susceptible to changes in interest rates than other interest earning assets since real estate loans possess a longer average term to their maturity or next interest rate reset 
during the period january through december  the fomc reduced the overnight inter bank borrowing rate on eleven different occasions  moving from a beginning rate of to an ending rate of 
because the bank s liabilities generally possess a shorter average term to maturity than its assets  the net interest margin and net interest spread both benefited from these reductions in interest rates 
the increase in net interest margin additionally reflected growth in the ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities from during the year ended june  to during the year ended june   reflecting additional equity generated during the period  a portion of which was invested in interest earning assets 
interest income 
interest income was million during the year ended june   an increase of million from million during the year ended june  increased interest income on real estate loans of million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  was partially offset by declines in interest income on mbs of million  on investment securities of million and on other short term investments of  during the same period 
as part of its ongoing strategy  the bank continued to emphasize growth in real estate loans as its primary interest earning asset  and de emphasized its securities portfolio while loan origination demand was strong 
the increase in interest income on real estate loans was attributable to an increase of million in the average balance of real estate loans resulting from real estate loan origi nations during the period july  through june  as a result of lower interest rates 
during the years ended june  and  real estate loan originations totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase reflected lower interest rates 
the decline of million in interest income on mbs and million on investment securities resulted from declines in both the average interest rate and average balance of these assets 
during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   the average balance of mbs declined million and investment securities declined million  due to principal repayments  maturities and calls of these securities as a result of lower interest rates that were partially offset by purchase activity 
interest income on other short term investments declined by  due to a decline of basis points in average yield during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   reflecting declines in short term interest rates during the period january through december overall  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points from during the year ended june  to during the year ended june  declines in the overnight inter bank borrowing rate brought about by actions of the fomc during the period january through december contributed to general decreases in interest rates  resulting in a reduction in the average yield of basis points on mbs  basis points on investment securities and basis points on other short term investments during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the yield on real estate loans declined by only basis points during this period 
real estate loans possess longer terms to maturity or interest rate repricing and  therefore  reacted slower than other interest earning assets to the declines in interest rates during the twelve months ended june  interest expense 
interest expense declined million  to million during the year ended june   from million during the year ended june  the decline in interest expense resulted substantially from a reduction of million in interest expense on borrowed funds  which resulted from a decline of million in the average balance of borrowed funds during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the average cost of cds  the next largest component of interest expense  declined by basis points  resulting in a reduction in interest expense of million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the average cost of money market accounts also declined basis points during the same period 
the average cost of savings accounts declined basis points during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   resulting in a decline in interest cost of million during the period 
these declines in average cost all reflected reductions in interest rates due to actions of the fomc during the period january through december interest expense on money market accounts increased million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   despite the decline of basis points in average cost during the period  resulting from an increase of million in the average balance of these deposits during this period 
the growth in the average balance of money market accounts resulted from ongoing marketing promotions related to these accounts 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  during the year ended june   compared to  during the year ended june  during the quarter ended december   an additional provision of  was recorded related to a loan added to troubled debt restructurings 
the provision of  during the year ended june  reflected the growth in the loan portfolio during the month period ended june  due to net charge offs of  recorded during the year ended june   the allowance for loan losses declined  during the same period 
during the year ended june   overall asset quality required no additional provisions beyond the  allocated to cover loan portfolio growth during the period 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  to million  during the year ended june   from million during the year ended june  the increase resulted primarily from increased prepayment fee income included in other non interest income of million  as loan prepayments increased during the period due to declines in interest rates 
in addition  fee income increased  during the year due to increased deposit customer fees resulting from both added depositors and changes in fees charged during the period 
during the year ended june   a gain on the sale of securities and other assets of million was recorded  primarily from the sale of equity investments 
during the year ended june   a gain of million on the sale of securities and other assets was recorded which also related primarily to sales of equity investments 
the gains on sales of equity securities during the twelve months ended june  were utilized to offset a portion of expenses associated with the prepayment of fhlbny advances during the year 
non interest expense 
non interest expense was million during the year ended june    above the level during the year ended june  salary and employee benefits increased million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   as a result of growth in management and employees added to satisfy needs created by the following growth in loan portfolio balance  growth in deposit balances  added deposit products  and two new retail branches 
the employee benefit costs associated with the esop  which are calculated based upon the average market value of the holding company s common stock  increased  due to an increase in the average market value of the holding company s common stock during the period  and were offset by the reduction of  in expenses associated with the rrp  as the amortization of the initial stock awards under the rrp was completed on february  goodwill amortization expense declined million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  effective july   goodwill amortization was eliminated in accordance with the adoption of sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
increased data processing costs of  during the twelve months ended june  compared to the year ended june  resulted from additional systems activity related to growth in the loan portfolio and additional deposit activity 
other expenses increased million during the twelve months ended june  compared to the twelve months ended june   due primarily to growth in public relations expenses of  marketing expenses of  as well as various branch administrative expenses such as supplies  postage and protective services associated with increased customer activities and two new branches added during the twelve month period ended june  income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   due primarily to an increase of million in pre tax net income 
the effective tax rate decreased from to during the period  due to the implementation of certain operational and investment activities that resulted in a reduction in the company s effective tax rate 
comparison of operating results for the years ended june  and general 
net income was million during the year ended june   an increase of million over net income of million during the year ended june  during the year ended june   an increase from the year ended june  of million in non interest income was partially offset by increases of million in non interest expense   in the provision for loan losses  and  in income tax expense 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended june  increased  to million from million during the year ended june  the increase was attributable to the overall growth in interest earning assets over the corresponding increase in interest bearing liabilities due to increased equity  checking accounts and other non interest bearing liabilities 
however  the beneficial impact of this growth was offset  in part  by the decline in the net interest spread during this period 
the net interest spread declined basis points from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   and the net interest margin declined basis points from to during the same period 
the decline in net interest spread and net interest margin both reflected a basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  resulting primarily from an increase in the average cost of borrowed funds of basis points  cds of basis points and money market accounts of basis points 
these interest rate increases all reflected increases in general interest rates during the period april through december the narrowing of the interest spread and net interest margin also reflected an million increase in average borrowed funds  the highest cost interest bearing liability 
the holding company s issuance  on apri l   of million in subordinated notes with a stated annual coupon of additionally contributed to the growth in interest expense on borrowed funds  as twelve months of expense was incurred on these notes during the year ended june  compared to two and one half months of expense incurred during the twelve month period ended june  during the period january  through june   reductions in general interest rates provided some reduction in borrowing costs  which partially offset the aforementioned items 
during the three months ended march   the fomc increased its overnight borrowing rate by basis points on two different occasions  moving from a beginning rate of to an ending rate of 
this rate was subsequently increased an additional basis points during the period april through december to  which is where it stood at december  during the period january  through june   the federal reserve bank reduced its federal funds borrowing rate on six different occasions  moving from the beginning overnight borrowing rate of to as of june  because the majority of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not reprice daily  the bank experiences delays in recognizing the effects of interest rate movements 
as a result  despite the significant reductions in interest rates by the federal reserve bank  which brought the o vernight borrowing rate at june  below its level at june   the overall yield on interest earning assets and cost on interest bearing liabilities were higher during the year ended june  than the year ended june  however  since the bank s liabilities typically reprice more rapidly than its assets  it did experience significant benefits to its net interest spread and net interest margin from the interest rate decreases during the quarter ended june  see item a qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended june  was million  an increase of million from million during the year ended june  the growth in interest income was attributable to increased interest income on real estate loans of million 
the growth in interest income on real estate loans was attributable primarily to an increase of million in the average balance of real estate loans  resulting from million of real estate loans originated during the twelve month period ended june  partially offsetting the increase in interest income on real estate loans was a decline of million in income on other interest earning assets composed of federal funds sold  commercial paper  and fhlbny capital stock from million during the year ended june  to million during the year ended june  this decline resulted fr om a reduction in the average balance of these assets of million  as the bank maintained a higher than normal level of investment in these short term assets during the quarter ended december  for liquidity purposes 
interest income on mbs declined million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   reflecting a reduction of million in average balance  and interest income on investment securities declined million  from million  during the twelve months ended june  to million during the twelve months ended june   reflecting a decline in average balance of million 
these declines in average balance resulted from an ongoing strategic shift in the composition of interest earning assets towards real estate loans 
the average balance of these securities during the year ended june  was below its level during the comparable period as more securities funds were allocated to real estate loans 
overall  the average yield on interest earning assets increased basis points from during the year ended june  to during the year ended june  the increase was attributable primarily to increases in the average yield of basis points on real estate loans  basis points on mbs and basis points on other interest earning assets  resulting primarily from general market interest rate increases during the period april through december the average interest rate on real estate loan originations during the year ended june  was  compared to during the year ended june   reflecting the increase in general market interest rates during the period april through december the ongoing strategic shift in composition of interest earning assets away from investment and mbs and towards real estate loans also had a beneficial impact on the average y ield of interest earning assets during the year ended june  interest expense 
interest expense increased million  to million  during the year ended june   from million during the year ended june  this increase resulted primarily from increased interest expense of million on borrowed funds  which resulted from both growth in the average balance of borrowed funds of million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   and an increase in the average cost of borrowed funds of basis points 
the increase in the average balance of borrowed funds resulted from growth in fhlbny advances from million at june  to million at june  while much of this growth occurred during the period july  through june   when the bank s deposit generation levels were lower  the full effect of this increase was recognized in the average balance computation for the yea r ended june   and only a portion of the growth was recognized in the average balance computation for the year ended june  the growth in borrowings resulted primarily from funding that was needed to support loan origination levels in excess of deposit funding during years ended june  and average borrowings also increased during this period as a result of the million in subordinated debt added on april   at a stated annual coupon of 
the subordinated notes contributed million to interest expense during the year ended june  the increase in average cost of borrowed funds reflected both prepayment expenses of  and the overall increase in interest rates during the period april through december there was no prepayment expense on borrowed funds during the twelve months ended june  interest expense on money market accounts increased million  resulting from both an increase of m illion in the average balance and an increase of basis points in average cost of these deposits during the year ended june  compared to the same period of the prior year 
the increase in average balance and average cost of money market accounts reflected the growth of these accounts from ongoing interest rate promotions during the period july  through june  interest expense on cds also increased million  which resulted from an increase of basis points in the average cost of these deposits  reflecting the overall increase in interest rates early in the year ended june  interest expense on savings accounts declined  due to a decline in average balance in these accounts of million  with much of these funds being moved to money market accounts 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  during the year ended june   compared to  during the year ended june  during the quarter ended december   an additional provision of  was recorded related to a troubled debt restructuring loan 
otherwise  the bank s overall asset quality remained relatively stable see item business asset quality 
the remaining loan loss provision of  during the period reflected both the bank s response to continued growth in real estate loans and its recognition of slight increases in delinquent and impaired loans 
the allowance for loan losses increased  during the year ended june   as the loan loss provision of  exceeded net charge offs of  during the period 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  to million  during the year ended june   from million during the year ended june  the increase resulted primarily from an increase of on the gain resulting from the disposal of securities and other assets 
during the year ended june   a net gain on the sale of equity investments of million was recorded 
during the year ended june   net losses of million associated with the sales of investments and mbs was recorded  which were partially offset by a gain of million on the sale of deposits at the gates avenue  brooklyn branch 
additionally  the bank s investment in boli  which was instituted in may  contributed an additional million to other non interest income during the year ended june  loan prepayment fees  a component of other non interest in come  declined  to  during the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june   reflecting reduced loan refinancing activity resulting from increased interest rates early in the year ended june   but were partially offset by increased bank retail fee income a component of service charges and other fees of  during the twelve months ended june   which resulted from increased deposit activities and a new customer debit card service instituted during the twelve month period ended june  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  from million during the year ended june   to million during the year ended june  salary and employee benefits remained relatively constant during the twelve months ended june  benefit plan restructurings  which became effective on july   provided reductions of million in salaries and employee benefits expenses during the year ended june  during the year ended june   in conjunction with the restructurings  a non recurring reduction in expense of million was recorded related to the curtailment gain resulting from the freezing of benefits accrued under the retirement plan 
the restructurings additionally contributed to the decline in esop expense of million during the twelve months ended june  compared to the prior comparative period  as the amortization period associated with the esop expense was increased  thus lowering the annual esop expense 
offsetting these declines were increases in salaries and benefits of million resulting pr imarily from base pay and staff increases necessitated by loan and deposit growth  and the dime savings bank of williamsburgh k plan k plan expenses  as k plan contributions were reinstated effective july  occupancy and equipment expense increased  during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   due primarily to increased rental  utility and branch property costs on the bank s branch offices that aggregated approximately  in addition  the bank experienced increased depreciation expense of  during the year ended june   due to the accelerated depreciation of computer equipment acquired in the fibc acquisition 
this accelerated depreciation resulted from management s revised estimate of the estimated useful life of the equipment 
federal deposit insurance premiums declined  during the year ended june  compared to june   due to a reduction in the assessment rates on saif insured deposits 
data processing costs increased  during the year ended june  compared to the prior comparative period  due to an increase in loan and deposit activity during the period  and other expenses increased  due primarily to increased advertising and direct marketing expenses of  income tax expense 
income tax expense increased  during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   due to an increase in pre tax income of million 
the increase in income tax expense was partially offset by a decline in income tax expense resulting primarily from the implementation of certain operational and investment activities that resulted in a reduction in the company s effective tax rate 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the company s consolidated assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s consolidated performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily fluctuate in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services

the additional disclosures are included herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a depository financial institution  the bank s primary source of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of interest income recorded on  and the market value of  a significant portion of the bank s assets 
fluctuations in interest rates will also ultimately impact the level of interest expense recorded on  and the market value of  a significant portion of the bank s liabilities 
in addition  the bank s real estate loan portfolio  concentrated primarily within the new york city metropolitan area  is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
neither the holding company nor the bank are subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
in addition  the company owns no trading assets  nor did it engage in any hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps or embedded derivative instruments during the year ended december  that require bifurcation 
in the future  the company may  with appropriate board approval  engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments 
since a majority of the company s consolidated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are located at the bank  virtually all of the interest rate risk exposure exists at the bank level 
as a result  all of the significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank level 
the bank s interest rate risk management strategy is designed to limit the volatility of net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements and has three primary components 
assets 
the bank s largest single asset type is the adjustable rate multi family residential loan 
multi family residential loans typically carry shorter average terms to maturity than one to four family residential loans  thus significantly reducing the overall level of interest rate risk 
approximately of multi family residential loans originated during the twelve months ended december  were adjustable rate  with repricing typically occurring after five or seven years  compared to approximately during the twelve months ended december  in addition  the bank has sought to include in its portfolio various types of adjustable rate one to four family loans and adjustable and floating rate investment securities  which generally have repricing terms of three years or less 
at december   adjustable rate real estate and consumer loans totaled billion  or of total assets  and adjustable rate investment securities cmos  remics  mbs issued by gses and other securities totaled million  or of total assets 
at december   adjustable rate real estate and consumer loans totaled billion  or of total assets  and adjustable rate investment securities cmos  remics  mbs issued by gses and other securities totaled million  or of total assets 
deposit liabilities 
as a traditional community based savings bank  the bank is largely dependent upon its base of competitively priced core deposits to provide stability on the liability side of the balance sheet 
the bank has retained many loyal customers over the years through a combination of quality service  convenience  and a stable and experienced staff 
core deposits  at december   were billion  or of total deposits 
the balance of cds as of december  was million  or of total deposits  of which million  or  were to mature within one year 
the weighted average maturity of the bank s cds at december  was months compared to months at december  depending on market conditions  the bank generally prices its cds in an effort to encourage the extension of the average maturities of deposit liabili ties beyond one year 
wholesale funds 
the bank is a member of the fhlbny  which provided the bank with a borrowing line of up to million at december  the bank borrows from the fhlbny for various purposes 
at december   the bank had outstanding advances of million with the fhlbny 
in june  the bank received approval from its board to accept brokered deposits as a source of funds 
the bank had no outstanding brokered deposits at either december  or december  at both june  and june   brokered deposits totaled million 
interest sensitivity gap the bank regularly monitors its interest rate sensitivity through a calculation of an interest sensitivity gap 
the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within a specific period 
the interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within a specified time frame exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within the same period 
conversely  the interest sensitivity gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within the same period 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution w ith a positive interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yields of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus an increase in the institution s net interest income  whereas an institution with a negative interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected to experience a decline in net interest income 
conversely  in a declining interest rate environment  an institution with a positive interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater decline in the yields of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus a decrease in the institution s net interest income  whereas an institution with a negative interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected to experience an increase in interest income 
the following table page sets forth the amounts of the company s consolidated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which are anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown repricing or maturing during a particular period reflect the earlier of term to repricing or term to repayment of the asset or liability 
the table is intended to provide an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
for purposes of presentation in the following table  the bank utilized its historical deposit attrition experience deposit decay rate for savings accounts  which it believes to be the most accurate measure 
for now  super now and money market accounts  it utilized the deposit decay rates published by the ots 
all amounts calculated in the table for both loans and mbs reflect principal balances expected to reprice as a result of anticipated principal repayments inclusive of early repayments or as a result of contractual interest rate adjustments 
at december  months or less more than months to months more than months to year more than year to years more than years to years more than years non interest bearing total dollars in thousands interest earning assets mortgages and other loans investment securities mortgage backed securities other short term investments fhlbny capital stock total interest earning assets less allowance for loan losses net interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities savings accounts now and super now accounts money market accounts certificates of deposit borrowed funds subordinated notes interest bearing escrow total interest bearing liabilities checking accounts other non interest bearing liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity positive negative interest sensitivity gap per period positive negative cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets cumulative total interest earning assets as a percent of cumulative total interest bearing liabilities interest earning assets are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments  scheduled rate adjustments  and contractual maturities or calls 
based upon historical repayment experience  and  where applicable  balloon payment dates 
the company s consolidated balance sheet is composed primarily of assets that mature or reprice within five years  with a significant portion maturing or repricing within one year 
in addition  the bank s deposit base is composed primarily of savings accounts  money market accounts and cds with maturities of two years or less 
at december   interest bearing liabilities estimated to mature or reprice within one year totaled billion  while interest earning assets estimated to mature or reprice within one year totaled million  resulting in a negative one year interest sensitivity gap of million  or negative of total assets 
in comparison  at december   the company s consolidated one year interest sensitivity gap was negative million  or negative of total assets 
the increase in the magnitude of the one year negative interest sensitivity g ap resulted from a decline in the level of investment securities and mbs maturing or repricing in one year or less coupled with an increase in cds and money market deposits repricing within one year  reflecting an increase in these accounts during certain limitations are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features  like annual and lifetime rate caps  which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled payments on their adjus table rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
under interest rate scenarios other than that which existed on december   the interest sensitivity gap for assets and liabilities could differ substantially based upon different assumptions about the manner in which core deposit decay rates and loan prepayments would change 
for example  the interest rate risk management model assumes that in a rising rate scenario  by paying competitive rates on non core deposits  a portion of core deposits will transfer to cds and be retained  although at higher cost 
also  in a rising interest rate environment  loan and mbs prepayment rates would be expected to slow  as borrowers postpone loan refinancings until rates again decline 
interest rate risk exposure npv compliance under guidelines established by ots thrift bulletin a  the bank also measures its interest rate risk through analysis of the change in its net portfolio value npv under several interest rate scenarios 
npv is the difference between the present value of the expected future cash flows of the bank s assets and liabilities  plus the value of net expected cash flows from either loan origination commitments or purchases of securities 
generally  the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of interest earning assets  which could adversely affect the company s consolidated results of operations if they were to be sold  or  in the case of interest earning assets classified as available for sale  reduce the company s consolidated stockholders equity  if retained 
the changes in the value of assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of those assets and liabilities 
under gaap  changes in the unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  on securities classified as available for sale will be reflected in stockholders equity through other comprehensive income 
as of december   the company s consolidated securities portfolio included million in securities classified as available for sale  which possessed a gross unrealized loss of million 
fluctuations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the value of such securities and could produce significant fluctuations in stockholders equity through other comprehensive income 
neither the holding company nor the bank owned any trading assets as of december  or in order to measure the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates  npv is calculated under market interest rates prevailing at a given quarter end pre shock scenario  and under various other interest rate scenarios rate shock scenarios represented by immediate  permanent  parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates from the actual term structure observed at quarter end 
the changes in npv due to fluctuations in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of the assets  liabilities  and commitments to either originate or sell loans and or purchase or sell securities that comprise the npv 
the npv ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the present value of the assets in the same scenario the npv ratio 
on a quarterly basis  an interest rate risk exposure compliance report is presented to the bank s board of directors 
this report  prepared in accordance with thrift bulletin a  presents a comparison of the bank s estimated pre shock npv to the various estimated npvs calculated under the rate shock scenarios 
the calculated estimates of the resulting npv ratios are compared to current limits established by management and approved by the board of directors 
the analysis that follows presents the estimated npv in the pre shock scenario and four rate shock scenarios and measures the dollar amount and percentage by which each of the rate shock scenario npvs change from the pre shock scenario npv 
interest rate sensitivity is measured by the changes in the various rate shock scenario npv ratios from the pre shock npv ratio 
at december  net portfolio value at december  dollar amount dollar change percentage change npv ratio basis point change in npv ratio npv ratio basis point change in npv ratio board approved npv limit interest rate scenario basis points basis points pre shock basis points basis points n a n a n a n a n a the npvs presented above incorporate some asset and liability values derived from the bank s valuation model  such as those for mortgage loans and time deposits  and some asset and liability values that are provided by independent and reputable sources  such as values for the bank s mbs and cmo portfolios  as well as for the bank s putable borrowings 
the valuation model makes various estimates regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and passbook decay balances at each level of interest rate change 
the bank s estimates for loan prepayment levels are influenced by the recent history of prepayment activity in its loan portfolio as well as the interest rate composition of the existing portfolio  especially  vis vis the current interest rate environment 
in addition  the bank considers the amount of prepayment fee protection inherent in the loan portfolio when estimating future prepaymen t cash flows 
regarding passbook deposit flows  the bank analyzes and tracks the decay rate of its passbook deposits over time and over various interest rate scenarios and then makes estimates of its passbook decay rate for use in the valuation model 
nevertheless  no matter the care and precision with which the estimates are derived  actual cash flows for loans  as well as passbooks  could differ significantly from the bank s estimates resulting in significantly different npv calculations 
the bank also generates a series of spot discount rates that are integral to the valuation of the projected monthly cash flows of its assets and liabilities 
the bank s valuation model employs discount rates that are representative of prevailing market rates of interest  with appropriate adjustments suited to the heterogeneous characteristics of the bank s various asset and liability portfolios 
the npv ratio at december  was in the pre shock scenario  a slight increase from the pre shock npv ratio of at december  the npv ratio was in the basis point rate shock scenario at december   a decline from the npv ratio of in the basis point rate shock scenario at december  at december   the sensitivity measure in the basis point rate shock scenario was negative basis points  compared to a sensitivity measure of negative basis points in the basis point rate shock scenario at december   reflecting increased sensitivity year over year 
the increase in the pre shock npv and npv ratio resulted primarily from a strong increase in the intangible value ascribed to the bank s core deposits 
the bank s core deposits at december  were both higher in balance and lower in weighted average rate than at december  during  while short term market interest rates declined  the average rates paid on the bank s core deposits declined by an even greater amount  increasing the intangible value calculated on every dollar of core deposits held by the bank at december   compared to december  the intangible value ascribed to the bank s cd portfolio also experienced a significant improvement during the year  even as the balance of cds declined 
the declines in the post shock basis point npv and npv ratios are primarily attributable to expected increased interest rate sensitivity in the bank s multi family residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios at december   compared to december  the basis point increase in interest rates is expected  at december  created a greater reduction in the level of principal repayments on mortgage loan refinances and satisfactions than was expected at december when comparing december  to december   the longer expected average lives of the multi family residential and commercial real estate loans in the basis point scenario causes a greater decline in their post shock scenario valuation compared to their pre shock valuation
