item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation business overview we develop and manufacture semiconductor materials and electronic devices made from sic  gan  silicon and related compounds 
the majority of our products are currently produced in our factory in durham  north carolina 
we derive the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of blue  green and near uv led chips 
we currently offer led chips at three brightness levels high brightness blue  traffic green  true green and near uv products  which include our megabright  xbright and xthin chips and our xb and xb power chip devices  mid brightness blue  traffic green and true green products  which include ultrabright and superbright devices  and standard brightness blue products 
our led chips are packaged by our customers and used by manufacturers as a lighting source for mobile appliances such as cell phones  automotive dashboard lighting  indicator lamps  miniature white lights  indoor and outdoor full color displays  traffic signals and other lighting applications 
some of our customers package our blue leds with a phosphor coating to create white leds 
in july  we released a family of new high power packaged leds called our xlamp products  that are designed to compete with conventional lighting technology for certain specialty lighting applications 
we currently are marketing these products for use in architectural lighting  appliance lighting  channel letters and reading lamps and target that future versions of xlamp will be used in emerging applications such as automotive headlamps and backlighting for large format lcd screens 
led products represented of our revenue in fiscal and in fiscal we also derive revenue from the sale of semiconductor wafers and epitaxy products made from sic and gan that our customers use for manufacturing leds and power devices or for research and development 
sales of sic and gan wafer and epitaxy products represented of our revenue in fiscal and of our revenue in fiscal we also sell sic materials in bulk crystal form to c c for use in gemstones 
sales of sic crystals for gemstones represented of our revenue in fiscal and of our revenue in fiscal our other products include sic based power and rf devices 
we received of our revenue in fiscal and less than of total revenue in fiscal from sales of power devices or sic based rf devices 
through our cree microwave segment  based in sunnyvale  california  we also develop and manufacture rf power transistors and modules using silicon technology 
during fiscal and fiscal  approximately and  respectively  of our revenue came from the sale of rf devices from our cree microwave segment 
these rf power transistors are a key semiconductor component for power amplifiers that are used in base stations to boost the power of a signal so that it can reach a wireless phone or other device within a designated geography 
the balance of our revenue  for fiscal and for fiscal  is derived from contract research funding 
under various programs  us government entities assist us in the development of new technology by funding our research and development efforts 
contract revenue includes funding for direct research and development costs and a portion of our general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses for contracts under which we expect funding to exceed direct costs over the life of the contract 
for contracts under which we anticipate that direct costs will exceed amounts to be funded over the life of the contract  we report direct costs as research and development expenses with related reimbursements recorded as an offset to those expenses 

table of contents fiscal overview we reported our highest annual revenue and earnings in fiscal primarily due to customer demand for our led chip products for the mobile appliance  automotive and led display markets 
our led revenue and units sold increased and  respectively  in fiscal over the previous fiscal year 
we saw the most significant increase in sales of our high brightness led chips  which we estimate were used mostly in the keypads and lcd backlights of mobile appliances  led video screens and automobile dashboards 
we introduced new higher performance chips during fiscal  including the xthin family  which is targeted for white led applications in mobile appliances 
we also introduced the megabright plus led  which is designed to provide our customers with a higher level of brightness than our standard chip design 
led revenue also benefited from continued growth in sales of our original megabright product line  which was introduced in fiscal our high brightness products made up and of our led revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
although total revenue for our mid brightness led chips increased in fiscal  mid brightness products represented of led revenue in fiscal as compared to in fiscal our increase in sales of mid brightness leds primarily was due to chip products that are used for blue keypad backlighting applications  including the introduction in fiscal of our razerthin led chip 
the razerthin product offers a smaller and thinner design and a lower forward voltage than our standard chips 
the thin design offers more flexibility for smaller phones  while the lower forward voltage extends the battery lifetime for mobile appliances 
revenue for our standard brightness devices increased in fiscal in comparison to fiscal these standard brightness devices are used for automotive and indicator light applications requiring high quality and a competitive price point 
standard brightness products were approximately and of our led revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  sic and gan materials revenue increased over the prior fiscal year due to a increase in the average sales price received for our wafers and epitaxy products 
the higher average sales price resulted from a change in our product mix 
additionally  materials revenue included  of gan wafer and epitaxy sales  which is part of the business we acquired from atmi in april revenue from sales of sic materials for use in gemstones was lower in fiscal due to lower yields and reduced customer demand 
sic gemstone materials sales were of our overall fiscal revenue 
sales of our sic based power devices and sic rf and microwave devices combined increased in fiscal  however  these sales only made up of our total revenue 
cree microwave s revenue for silicon based microwave products increased in fiscal this growth was achieved due to new design wins for bipolar and ldmos devices that service the wireless infrastructure and mil aero markets 
government contract revenue was flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal  as increased cost sharing provisions on existing and new contracts offset new awards realized during fiscal in may  we were awarded two contracts through the robert morris acquisition center  providing for up to million over five years 
these contracts focus on the development of manufacturing technology for high temperature  high power sic semiconductor material and power devices for use in electric traction drive power components and associated power conditioning and control electronics for the next generation of combat vehicles 
additionally  fiscal revenues included  of fourth quarter contract sales from the business unit we acquired from atmi in april in fiscal  we anticipate that selling blue led chips for white led lamps in mobile appliances and other applications will be an important growth opportunity 
based on trends in the industry  we believe that a greater percentage of cell phones and other handheld electronics will use white leds as a backlight for the keypad and for full color screens in fiscal we recently have introduced a family of xthin led devices 
table of contents that target these and other applications 
we also are working to increase the brightness for the xthin family of products from milliwatts to milliwatts in the first half of fiscal if we are successful in developing brighter leds  we believe that we have an opportunity to gain market share in the color lcd backlight market for cell phones that use white leds 
we believe that we currently have low penetration in this particular market because previously  when our customers packaged our leds as white leds  they were not as bright as some of the packaged white products sold by nichia 
nichia currently has an efficient phosphor solution that makes its white conversion products brighter than our customers products 
with our higher performance xthin chips  we target that white products packaged by some of our customers can be as bright or brighter than products sold by nichia 
based on information available to us  we believe markets for our high brightness led applications  such as specialty lighting  displays  automotive and other applications  will continue to grow in fiscal we also recently introduced our xlamp family of high power packaged led products in july we target these new products for specialty lighting markets  including channel letters  appliance lights and reading lights 
as automotive headlight and large screen led applications emerge  we intend to position our xlamp products to serve these markets 
we believe that our competitors around the world are increasing their capacity for the led market and we factor these considerations into our expansion plans 
despite the evolving competitive pressures and additional capacity that is anticipated to come on line in the next year from us and our competitors  we target that our business will increase if we are successful in developing higher performance  low cost led chips 
we believe our proprietary sic platform and vertically integrated factory provides us with the opportunity to increase our brightness and lower our cost by scaling to larger sized wafers 
currently  some of our significant challenges for fiscal include increasing the output from our factory and expanding our facilities  migrating led production to three inch wafers and developing brighter xthin and other led products 
we are planning to invest million during fiscal in capital equipment additions and increasing employee headcount to expand our factory output and to improve our yields 
we plan to migrate the majority of our led production from two inch to three inch sic wafers over the next four quarters  which we target to greatly increase the number of led chips per wafer and therefore lower our overall led chip cost 
however  the initial three inch conversion may cause short term yield challenges as we work to fully integrate the larger wafer size into production 
we also target to increase the brightness for the xthin family of products in fiscal  and we must work with our customers to get these and other products designed into key applications so that we can assist them to gain market share with these products 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
critical accounting policies include those policies that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  which potentially could produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we have approximately million of long lived assets as of june   including approximately million related to fixed assets and capitalized patents  million in long term investments held to maturity  million in long term marketable securities available for sale and million of other long term assets  including net investments in privately held companies of million and long term deposits of million 
in addition to the original cost of these assets  their recorded value is impacted by a number of management estimates that are determined based on our judgment  including estimated useful lives  salvage values and  in  impairment charges 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 
table of contents accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we record impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets have been impaired 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimations of the fair market value of the assets  and ii estimations of future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in our operations and estimated salvage values 
for example  we recorded an impairment charge for long lived assets of  for the three months ended june  for obsolete production equipment that was taken out of service and destroyed 
during the second and third quarters of fiscal  our cree microwave segment identified certain equipment that was written off because we determined the equipment would not be used and it was unable to sell the equipment to a third party 
the total amount of this write off was  we also recorded a million impairment charge for the three months ended december   due to the election by management to discontinue a novel epitaxy reactor project 
during fiscal  we determined certain property and equipment was impaired under sfas no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which was the relevant accounting pronouncement at the time  and as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed an impairment analysis of the intangible assets and goodwill related to the acquisition of cree microwave 
this analysis was performed due to significant changes in business conditions at the operating segment 
first  cree microwave amended its supply agreement with spectrian effective march   which resulted in a significant reduction in quarterly revenue expectations 
in addition  cree microwave s outlook for acquiring additional customers in the near term weakened due to delays in the development of ldmos technology  the overall deteriorating economic conditions and long product qualification cycles 
also  the principal products that spectrian indicated it would consider purchasing from cree microwave in the future were not fully qualified and  subsequently not released to production at the time 
as a result of this impairment analysis  we estimated that the future cash flows of the cree microwave business would not be sufficient to provide for recovery of the carrying value of its intangible assets and goodwill 
therefore  the remaining balance of intangible assets and goodwill of million was deemed fully impaired and was written off in march in november  we entered into an agreement terminating our supply contract with spectrian  and  due to the changed circumstances  management performed an impairment analysis of the tangible assets at cree microwave as of june  and june  in accordance with sfas based on estimations of the fair market value of the assets  and estimations of future cash flows  we determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flow exceeded the amount of the book value of the long term tangible assets 
as a result  no additional cree microwave assets were deemed impaired or written down at that time 
we also review our capitalized patent portfolio and record impairment charges when circumstances warrant  such as when issued patents have been abandoned or patent applications are no longer being pursued 
as of june   june  and june   we had no impairments of our patents 
accounting for non marketable and marketable equity securities 
from time to time  we make strategic investments in the equity securities of privately held companies 
since we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of these companies  these investment balances are carried at cost and accounted for using the cost method of accounting 
the shares of stock we received in these investments are not presently publicly traded and there is no other established market value for these securities 
we have a policy in place to estimate the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of such investments 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each company s cash position  estimates of the company s market capitalization based on recent financing transactions  its earnings and revenue outlook  operational performance  management or ownership changes and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we are provided by these privately held companies 
since these companies are not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if the carrying value of an investment is determined to be an amount in excess of our 
table of contents estimate of fair value  and we have determined that the decline is other than temporary  it is our policy to record a write down of the investment 
this write down is estimated based on the information described above  and it is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal  we recorded a write down on these investments of million  representing our estimate of other than temporary declines in value based on a review of these factors described above 
estimating the fair value of non marketable investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
there were no adjustments made to investment losses on our consolidated statements of operations during fiscal and relating to our investments in privately held companies 
in june  the common stock of one of the privately held companies in which we held an investment  color kinetics incorporated color kinetics  became publicly traded 
as a result  we reclassified our investment  valued at cost at million  from other long term assets to a long term marketable security on our consolidated balance sheet 
from time to time  we evaluate strategic opportunities and potential investments in complementary businesses  and as a result we may invest in marketable equity securities 
we classify marketable securities that are not trading or held to maturity securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
realized gains and losses are recognized when realized upon sale or disposition 
declines in value that are deemed to be other than temporary in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for investments in certain debt and equity securities  sfas are recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
we have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a periodic basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy requires  among other things  a review of each company s cash position  stock price performance  liquidity  ability to raise capital and any management changes 
based on this review  if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists in the value of one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value 
in addition  we record a write down for investments in publicly held companies for an other than temporary impairment any time the market price of the security has remained below our average cost for two consecutive fiscal quarters  unless strong positive evidence exists that makes it clear that an other than temporary write down would be inappropriate under the guidance of sfas any related write down would then be recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the common stock of color kinetics became publicly traded and as a result  we have accounted for this investment as a marketable security that is available for sale under sfas as of june  our investment in color kinetics is valued at million  which represents the million cost  plus a million unrealized gain in the security based on the closing share price on june  as an available for sale security  any unrealized gain or loss is accounted for as a comprehensive income item in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet and on the consolidated statement of shareholders equity and is not recorded through earnings 
at june   we held no marketable equity securities 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold our entire position in two publicly traded companies 
we sold  common shares in microvision  inc microvision for million  with a net loss on the sale of  recognized during the second quarter of fiscal we also sold  common shares in emcore corporation emcore for million  with a net loss on the sale of million recognized during the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we recorded an other than temporary investment loss of million related to available for sale marketable securities based primarily on sustained reductions in stock price performance for our investments in microvision and emcore 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using the first in  first out method for finished goods and work in process accounts and the average cost method is used for raw materials for the cree segment 
the cree microwave segment uses a standard cost inventory costing method 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities  impairment of value and obsolescence on 
table of contents a monthly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers  sales team and management estimates 
we reserve for inventories on hand that are greater than twelve months old  unless there is an identified need for the inventory 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand  manufacturing process changes that result in existing inventory obsolescence or new product introductions  which eliminate demand for existing products 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our manufacturing cost or market value 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our estimates  additional inventory write downs may be required and would increase cost of revenue in the period the revision is made 
during fiscal  we recorded a  reserve for slow moving inventory in cree microwave and a  reserve for slow moving inventory in the cree segment 
in fiscal  as a result of the termination of the supply agreement with spectrian  we recorded a million reserve in the cree microwave segment for inventory that was slow moving or specifically identified to be sold to spectrian  including customized parts 
we also reserved an additional  of other slow moving inventory at cree microwave 
this inventory charge was taken because of change in demand from spectrian  as spectrian initially indicated that it would have strong demand for a type of transistor and later determined that the demand had significantly weakened 
during the three months ended december   we reserved  in the cree segment for slow moving led and wafer inventory 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million reserve at our cree microwave segment for non ldmos and older ldmos devices as a result of contract negotiations with spectrian that identified these devices as obsolete 
all of these adjustments were recorded through cost of revenue 
in addition  we also wrote off million of costs associated with initial xbright products and  of costs associated with ldmos devices as research and development expenses in the first quarter of fiscal the million write down was attributable to early generation xbright devices that were later determined to be non saleable because of design deficiencies 
the  write down was associated with ldmos products that were on hand and determined not to be saleable for similar reasons 
in both cases  our customers had initially accepted the devices and we produced initial amounts of the product 
based on history with our customers  normally once products are accepted  they are ultimately qualified 
thus we concluded that capitalizing the cost of these items as inventory was appropriate 
however  in both cases  our customers later rejected the products 
therefore  we wrote off the entire amount of inventory as research and development expenses  because the materials were never qualified as completed devices or ultimately sold to customers 
in the case of the led devices  our customers returned all products shipped of that technology 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of a contract exists  such as when a purchase order or contract is received from the customer  the price is fixed  title of the goods has transferred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
the majority of our products have shipping terms that are free on board fob or free carrier alongside fca shipping point  which means that we fulfill the obligation to deliver when the goods are handed over and into the charge of the carrier at our shipping dock 
this means that the buyer bears all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that point 
the difference between fob and fca is that under fca terms  the customer designates a shipping carrier of choice to be used 
in certain cases  we ship our product cost insurance and freight cif 
under this arrangement  revenue is recognized under fob shipping point terms  however  we are responsible for the cost of insurance to transport the product as well as the cost to ship the product 
for all of our sales other than those with cif terms  we invoice our customers only for shipping costs necessary to physically move the product from our place of business to the customer s location 
the costs primarily consist of overnight shipping charges 
we incur the direct shipping costs on behalf of the customer and invoice the customer to obtain direct reimbursement for such costs 
we currently account for our shipping costs by recording the amount of freight that is invoiced to customers as revenue  with the corresponding cost recorded as cost of revenue 
in fiscal  we recognized  as revenue for shipping and handling costs 
in fiscal years and  we accounted for such costs as a cost of revenue 
table of contents with the reimbursement of these costs reflected as a direct offset and reduction of cost of revenue 
such shipping costs were not material in those fiscal years 
except for consigned inventory  revenue is recognized from our customers at shipment 
if inventory is maintained at a consigned location  revenue is recognized when our customer pulls product for its use and the title of the goods is transferred to the customer 
we provide our customers with limited rights of return for non conforming shipments and warranty claims for up to months for cree microwave products 
we accrue estimated warranty expense as a cost of revenue 
we also record a reserve for estimated sales returns as a reduction of revenue at the time of revenue recognition 
significant judgments and estimates made by management are used in connection with establishing the allowance for sales returns 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the allowance for sales returns at june  was  for two customers  sumitomo and osram  we defer revenue equal to levels specified in contractual arrangements 
this deferred revenue  which predominantly arises under the sumitomo contract  amounted to million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
please see the discussion in item of this report under distributorship agreement with sumitomo corporation for further information 
revenue from government contracts and certain private entities is recorded on the proportional performance method as contract expenses are incurred 
contract revenue represents reimbursement by various us government entities to aid in the development of new technology 
the applicable contracts generally provide that we may elect to retain ownership of inventions made in performing the work  subject to a non exclusive license retained by the government to practice the inventions for government purposes 
the contract funding may be based on either a cost plus or a cost share arrangement 
the amount of funding under each contract is determined based on cost estimates that include direct costs  plus an allocation for research and development  general and administrative and the cost of capital expenses 
cost plus funding is determined based on actual costs plus a set percentage margin 
for the cost share contracts  the actual costs relating to the activities to be performed by us under the contract are divided between the us government and us based on the terms of the contract 
the government s cost share is then paid to us 
activities performed under these arrangements include research regarding sic and group iii nitride materials and devices 
the contracts typically require the submission of a written report that documents the results of such research  as well as some material deliverables 
the revenue and expense classification for contract activities is based on the nature of the contract 
for contracts where we anticipate that funding will exceed direct costs over the life of the contract  funding is reported as contract revenue and all direct costs are reported as costs of contract revenue 
for contracts under which we anticipate that direct costs of the activities subject to the contract will exceed amounts to be funded over the life of the contract  costs are reported as research and development expenses and related funding is reported as an offset of those expenses 
accruals for liabilities and warranties 
we make estimates for the amount of costs that have been incurred but not yet billed for general services  including legal and accounting fees  costs pertaining to our self funded medical insurance  warranty costs and other expenses 
many of these expenses are estimated based on historical experience or information gained directly from the service providers 
valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of june   we had million recorded as a short term deferred tax asset and million as a long term deferred tax liability 
this asset was recorded as a result of tax benefits associated with write downs and reserves recorded for accounts receivable and inventory reserves that are deferred for tax purposes 
the liability provides amounts due as a result of the timing difference for depreciation between book and tax purposes being offset by deferred tax benefits associated with write downs taken for goodwill and other intangible assets  other than temporary charges taken on our investments and other write downs taken in prior years 
we have a reserve for taxes that may become payable in the future included in deferred tax liabilities 
a valuation allowance has been established on capital loss carryforwards and unrealized losses on certain securities as we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the items will not be realized 

table of contents it is our policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years  and we currently have a reserve of million for such deferred tax liabilities 
we establish the reserves based upon management s assessment of exposure associated with the tax return deduction 
we analyze the tax reserves at least annually and make adjustments as events occur that warrant adjustment to the reserve 
for example  if the statutory period for assessing tax on a given tax return lapses  we reduce the reserve associated with that period 
similarly  if tax authorities provide administrative guidance or a decision is rendered in the courts  we make appropriate adjustments to our tax reserve 
the tax reserve was unchanged in fiscal the tax reserve increased by million for the year ended june  the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

table of contents comparison of fiscal years ended june  and june  revenue 
revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal higher revenue was primarily attributable to greater product revenue  which increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal much of the increase in revenue resulted from significantly higher unit shipments of our led products due to stronger demand from our customers primarily for mobile appliance  display and automotive applications 
led revenue was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the most significant increase in revenue in fiscal came from sales to our japanese distributor  sumitomo 
revenue from sales to sumitomo increased by or million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to strong demand among japanese manufacturers for our products for mobile appliance  displays  automotive  consumer products and indicator light applications 
during fiscal  four of our top ten end customers were located in japan 
the sales to these companies were reported in our revenue from sumitomo 
for fiscal year  sumitomo s advance purchase commitment was approximately million  and revenue recognized from sumitomo was million 
for fiscal year  sumitomo s advance purchase commitment is approximately million  however  sumitomo s purchase commitment is subject to end customer demand and other terms and conditions 
revenue from sales to agilent increased by or million  in fiscal over the prior fiscal year 
much of this increased business resulted from demand for our products to be used in mobile appliance keypads  displays and other consumer product applications 
revenue from sales to osram declined by  or million in fiscal due to changes in their customer s demand and other factors 
during fiscal  we continued to see an increase in business from a number of asian led packagers who serve a variety of mobile appliance and other consumer applications 
with respect to our cree microwave segment  sales to remec increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal a portion of our sales to remec in fiscal was for legacy spectrian designs under last time buy arrangements that may not continue after the first quarter of fiscal two of our customer arrangements provide for product exchanges and reimbursement of certain sales costs 
for these customers  we defer revenue equal to the level specified in these contractual arrangements and recognize the related revenue less any claims made against the reserves when the customers exchange rights expire and the deferred revenue reserves are released 
the reserve expires no later than two quarters from the date of the original sale 
in connection with our distributorship agreement with sumitomo  such deferred revenue amounted to million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
in connection with our purchase agreement with osram  such deferred revenue amounted to  and zero as of june  and june   respectively 
our led revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and made up of our total revenue in fiscal our blended average led sales price declined for the twelve months ended june compared to the prior fiscal year 
our average sales price for leds was lower due to increasing price competitiveness in the marketplace  which was somewhat offset by a change in the product mix of our sales toward higher brightness products that have a higher average sales price 
for fiscal  our led chip volume increased over prior year shipments 
sales of our high brightness led products more than doubled in fiscal over fiscal as our customers designed them into more led packages for white light applications such as for keypads in mobile appliances  lcd backlights and camera flashes 
high brightness products also are used for automotive  displays and other illumination applications 
these products include our xthin  xbright  megabright and power chip led products 
the majority of these products were introduced in the last two fiscal years 
revenue from our mid brightness products  including our ultrabright and superbright chips  also increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to new designs for keypads in mobile appliances  as well as automotive applications  displays and consumer product applications 
in fiscal  we introduced the razerthin and ut chips for mobile appliances that offer a smaller and thinner design and a lower 
table of contents forward voltage than our standard chips 
the thin design offers more flexibility for smaller phones  while the lower forward voltage extends the battery lifetime for mobile appliances 
shipments of our standard brightness products were slightly higher in fiscal in comparison to the prior fiscal year due to stable demand for automotive and indicator light applications 
sic wafer and epitaxy revenue was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
wafer revenue increased over the prior year due to increased sales to corporate and university research customers for wafers with epitaxy layers 
wafer units declined while the average sales price increased during fiscal additionally  fiscal revenues included  of fourth quarter gan product sales from the unit we acquired from atmi in april wafer revenue made up of our total revenue in fiscal sic materials revenue for gemstone use was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from sales of our sic materials for use in gemstones decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a combination of lower demand and lower overall product yields 
we achieved improvements in our product yield in the second half of fiscal revenue from gemstone materials was of our total sales for fiscal revenue from cree microwave products was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
cree microwave revenue made up of our total revenue for fiscal revenue from these products increased during fiscal over fiscal due to incremental orders from new customers for our newer ldmos devices designed for wireless infrastructure and mil aero markets 
in addition  cree microwave s sales to remec were million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal some of these sales to remec were for legacy spectrian applications under last time buy arrangements that may not continue after the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we had better success in gaining new customers for our cree microwave products as the economic environment for wireless infrastructure spending improved 
product sales mix for our ldmos devices made up of microwave revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
revenue attributable to bipolar devices was and for fiscal and  respectively 
engineering service revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to the prior year s work achieving design wins and generating product sale growth in fiscal overall  our average sales price for cree microwave products decreased compared to the prior fiscal year while our unit shipments increased 
contract revenue was of total revenue for fiscal contract revenue received from us government agencies increased by less than during fiscal compared to fiscal  as we continued to perform under multi year contract awards that we received at the end of fiscal and the beginning of fiscal in may  we were awarded two contracts through the robert morris acquisition center  providing for up to million over five years 
these contracts focus on the development of manufacturing technology for high temperature high power sic semiconductor material and power devices for use in electric traction drive power components and associated power conditioning and control electronics for the next generation of combat vehicles 
in fiscal  we recorded  of revenue associated with these two new contracts 
additionally  fiscal revenues included  of fourth quarter contract sales from the business unit we acquired from atmi in april we target contract revenue to increase slightly during fiscal as a result of the award of additional funding under existing contracts and the award of the new contracts in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year  gross margins increased from to of revenue 
in fiscal  our blended average sales prices declined while our blended average led costs decreased 
table of contents compared to fiscal therefore  gross margins improved in fiscal primarily because of these significantly lower costs for leds 
led costs declined faster than blended average prices due to improved yields  greater scale and throughput and other process improvements 
our wafer sales also were more profitable in fiscal than fiscal due to a higher percentage of wafers sold with epitaxy 
wafer costs for our sic materials sales were lower in fiscal than fiscal  due to the shift in product mix and a  reduction in wafer inventory reserves 
contract margins declined from in fiscal to in fiscal due to a higher percentage of cost share work performed during the year 
our cree microwave segment reported negative gross profit of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
higher revenue in fiscal contributed to reduce the segment s negative gross profit 
factory throughput due to increased sales volume also has improved our cost per unit 
during fiscal  cree microwave s gross margin also benefited from adjustments totaling  for a revision of standard costs and a prior year reversal of the warranty expense accrual 
in fiscal  we increased our allowance for sales returns by  due to business growth  and the cree segment established a  reserve for potential future product warranty claims  which lowered gross profit by  in fiscal  gross profit included a million write down of inventory at cree microwave due to the termination of the supply agreement with spectrian and other slow moving products 
we also recorded a million increase to inventory reserves for led and wafer products in fiscal in addition  reserves for allowance for sales returns were increased by  in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development spending supported our three inch process development  our thin chip products xthin  razerthin and ut  x class and power chip leds xb and xb  our xlamp high power packaged leds and other high brightness led research programs 
in addition  we funded ongoing development for higher power higher linearity rf and microwave devices  near uv laser devices and higher power diodes switches 
during fiscal  we included a million charge for costs associated with initial xbright chips that were made in previous quarters and were never fully qualified by customers 
from time to time  our customers and companies that we invest in participate in research and development funding for specific programs 
we record this customer and third party funding as an offset against research and development expenses 
customers and third parties in whom we invested funded zero and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the funding we received in fiscal came from an affiliate of lighthouse  in which we hold a private company equity investment 
at this time  we do not expect funding for research and development during fiscal from this or any other customer or third party in which we invested 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in expenses primarily resulted from the increasing general expense associated with the growth of our business and a higher level of funding for our employee profit sharing program 
during fiscal  we incurred approximately  of incremental legal and other costs associated with litigation and costs of a special committee investigation conducted by the board of directors 
fiscal includes legal costs associated with the patent infringement case with nichia  which was settled in november loss on disposal of fixed assets 
loss on the disposal of fixed assets decreased to million in fiscal from million recorded in fiscal during fiscal  we identified certain equipment that was obsolete and no longer in service 
we wrote off the value of these assets and disposed of them 
during fiscal  we recorded a million write down for fixed assets associated with a novel epitaxy equipment project that we discontinued before the vendor delivered the equipment to us 
the amount represented a deposit that we paid for the equipment 
we also disposed of  of other assets during fiscal 
table of contents severance charges 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we incurred  of severance charges at our cree microwave segment for employees who were laid off and received their severance payments during the same period 
gain on termination of supply agreement 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we received a million one time payment from spectrian associated with the termination of the supply agreement between cree microwave and spectrian 
we did not receive any similar payments in fiscal loss on investments in marketable securities 
we recorded a million loss in fiscal related to marketable securities that we sold during the second quarter of fiscal there were no realized gains or losses on investments in marketable securities recorded in fiscal other non operating income 
other non operating income increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded non operating income for a contractually agreed upon payment from one of our customers for a foreign currency translation adjustment included in the applicable sales contract 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a one time technology license fee 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded and received a contractually agreed upon payment from one of our customers for a foreign currency translation adjustment included in the applicable sales contract 
interest income  net 
interest income  net decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the reduction resulted primarily from lower interest rates available for our liquid cash and securities held to maturity over the applicable period 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase resulted mainly from our greater pre tax profitability in fiscal  which increased over fiscal in addition  our effective income tax rate increased to for fiscal compared to a rate for fiscal the fiscal effective rate was higher than the fiscal effective tax rate as we benefited from tax credits and other permanent tax differences in fiscal historically  our reported taxable income has been significantly lower than income reported for financial reporting purposes 
the primary reasons for this difference are the timing differences for depreciation  stock option deductions for tax purposes and other tax planning strategies which are net of impairment charges expensed for financial accounting purposes that are not tax deductible 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and june  revenue 
revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal higher revenue was primarily attributable to greater product revenue  which increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal much of the increase in revenue resulted from significantly higher unit shipments of our led products due to stronger demand from our customers primarily for mobile appliance and automotive applications 
led revenue was million and million  for fiscal and  respectively 
the most significant increase in revenue in fiscal came from sales to our japanese distributor  sumitomo 
revenue from sales to sumitomo increased by or million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to strong demand among japanese manufacturers for our products for mobile appliance  automotive  consumer products and indicator light applications 
revenue from sales to osram and agilent also increased by or million and or million  respectively  in fiscal over the prior year comparative period 
much of this increased business was caused by demand for our products used in mobile appliances as well as automotive and other applications 
during fiscal  we also noted an increase in business from several asian led packagers as our customer base became more diversified 
the only significant decline in revenue came from spectrian  which was acquired by remec in december  where revenue from sales declined or million in fiscal as compared to fiscal spectrian or remec purchases silicon rf transistors from our cree microwave segment 

table of contents certain of our customer arrangements provide for product exchanges and reimbursement of certain sales costs 
for sumitomo  we defer revenue equal to the level specified in these contractual arrangements and recognize the related revenue less any claims made against the reserves when the customers exchange rights expire and the deferred revenue reserves are released 
the reserve expires no later than two quarters from the date of the original sale 
deferred revenue amounted to million and  as of june  and june   respectively 
our led revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and made up of our total revenue in fiscal our average led sales price declined for the twelve months ended june compared to the prior year 
our average sales price for leds also was lower due to increasing price competitiveness in the marketplace and a change in the product mix of our sales to customers 
for fiscal  our led chip volume increased over prior year shipments 
the most significant increase to revenue occurred in our mid brightness range of led products 
our lower range mid brightness led products have been incorporated into new designs in the keypads of several mobile phone models that feature a blue color as well as blue leds that are used as the backlight for blue displays 
in addition  these led chips are now used in other products targeting gaming equipment  consumer products and office automation applications 
the introduction of the megabright blue  green and uv products in fiscal also generated new design wins for our customers 
megabright s product performance in fiscal generated new opportunities in other markets  particularly mobile appliance applications for blue and white led backlight designs 
blue and white leds replaced a portion of the yellow green leds that have traditionally backlit mobile handsets as more handsets began offering blue backlit keypads and full color displays backlit by white leds 
the megabright product line also was used in new automotive designs from both european and asian manufacturers for the model year 
during fiscal  we introduced our xbright family of leds  including blue  green and near uv devices 
these products offer a higher brightness than our megabright products 
we completed the introduction of these devices in the second half of fiscal  however  we continued to work with customers to optimize our chip design for use in their packages 
shipments of our standard brightness products were flat in fiscal in comparison to the prior year due to stable demand for automotive and indicator light applications 
sic wafer revenue was million and million  for fiscal and  respectively 
wafer revenue increased over the prior year due to greater sales to corporate and university research customers 
wafer units declined while the average sales price increased during fiscal  due to a lower mix of shipments to osram  which uses wafers in commercial production 
since osram uses the wafers in commercial high volume production  it receives volume discounts on its purchases  therefore  these sales have a lower average sales price 
we also sold more wafers with epitaxial layers during fiscal to customers such as infineon technologies infineon  which contributed to a higher average sales price 
wafer revenue made up of our total revenue in fiscal revenue from sales of our sic materials for use in gemstones increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal as c c increased its orders to us 
sic materials revenue from materials sold for gemstone use was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from gemstone materials was of our total sales for fiscal revenue from silicon based microwave products was million and million  for fiscal and  respectively 
microwave revenue made up of our total revenue for fiscal revenue from these products decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in revenue resulted from the termination of the supply agreement with spectrian in november approximately of cree microwave revenues were derived from shipments to spectrian in fiscal prior to the termination of the supply agreement  spectrian had reduced its purchase obligations beginning in march because our ldmos products had not been qualified 
we amended our agreement with spectrian in march  which resulted in spectrian ordering fewer products each quarter until the 
table of contents agreement was terminated in november we also had little success in gaining new customers in fiscal due to the poor economic environment for wireless infrastructure spending 
our ldmos products were released to production in november  but these products did not contribute significantly to revenue since design cycles can be to months for wireless infrastructure applications 
product sales mix for our cree microwave products remained constant as ldmos made up and of microwave revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
revenue attributable to bipolar devices was and for fiscal and  respectively 
approximately of cree microwave s revenue was from engineering services for fiscal as we continued to work with new customers toward design wins 
overall  our average sales price for cree microwave products was fairly stable compared to the prior fiscal year 
the most significant factor impacting revenue for our cree microwave segment was the decline in units sold as a result of the termination of the spectrian supply agreement and the overall slowdown in spectrian s business prior to the termination of the supply agreement 
contract revenue was of total revenue for fiscal contract revenue received from us government agencies increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  due to additional contract awards that we received in fiscal in june  we were awarded two contracts by onr  with a total value of approximately million as part of the wide bandgap semiconductor technology initiative of darpa 
in july  we were awarded government contracts totaling million  if fully funded  over a three year period from onr and the afrl 
in fiscal  we recognized approximately million in revenue from these contracts 
additionally  we were awarded with another contract in june funded by darpa  through the united states army robert morris acquisition center  to pursue the development of uv leds and lasers for a variety of military communications and bio threat detection applications under darpa s suvos program 
in fiscal  this darpa suvos contract from arl accounted for approximately million in total revenue 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal compared to the prior year  gross margins increased from to of revenue 
in fiscal  gross profit included a million write down of inventory at cree microwave due to the termination of the supply agreement with spectrian 
in fiscal  gross profit included a million charge relating to an inventory write off and other related costs that were recorded as a part of the downsizing of cree microwave s operations 
in fiscal  gross margins were impacted by higher led margins being offset by negative margins from the cree microwave segment 
led margins improved as our average sales price decreased by while the average cost of our leds decreased by due to higher throughput in the factory and improved yields 
because a significant portion of our factory cost is fixed  higher throughput typically results in lower costs per unit produced 
in addition  during fiscal  our led costs per unit were higher than during fiscal due to inefficiencies typically associated with new product introductions as we released both the megabright and xbright family of products during the year 
negative gross profits were million for our cree microwave business during fiscal as compared to gross profits of million recorded during fiscal  despite the million write off of inventory discussed above 
low factory throughput due to significantly reduced sales volume dramatically impacted our cost per unit 
wafer costs for our sic materials sales were higher in fiscal than  due to the shift in product mix of wafers sold with epitaxy as compared to production volume wafers sold to osram 
contract margins declined from in fiscal to in fiscal due to a higher percentage of cost share contracts being worked on during the year 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development spending supported our xbright  megabright plus  xbright plus  and razerthin product lines  and our power chip 
table of contents leds as well as higher brightness led research programs 
in addition  we funded development of our ldmos  sic and group iii nitride microwave devices  our schottky diode power program and our near uv lasers 
while research and development spending increased  customer support of certain research and development programs decreased by million  thereby further increasing costs 
from time to time  our customers and companies that we invest in participate in research and development funding for specific programs 
we record this third party funding as an offset against research and development expenses 
customers and third parties in whom we invested funded  and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the majority of this funding was received from companies in which we have made investments 
in fiscal  the entire customer funding we received came from an affiliate of lighthouse  in which we hold a private company equity investment 
in fiscal  microvision  the lighthouse affiliate  and xemod funded million  million and  respectively  of our research and development 
we held an investment in each of these companies at the time that they provided research and development funding to us 
in addition  spectrian  our largest customer for our cree microwave segment  also participated in funding our research and development programs for million 
when customers participate in funding our research and development programs  we record the amount funded as a reduction of research and development expenses 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in expenses was due mostly to higher premiums for insurance and greater spending to support the growth of the business  including increased performance based compensation plans for all employees 
intangible asset amortization 
intangible asset amortization decreased to zero during fiscal from million during fiscal nine months of intangible asset amortization was included in fiscal resulting from the acquisition of cree microwave in december in march an analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets indicated that the carrying values of such assets had been fully impaired under sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of see impairment of goodwill and loss on disposal of fixed assets below 
therefore  we wrote off the entire amount of goodwill and other intangible assets in march prior to the write off of goodwill and intangible assets  we were amortizing these assets over periods ranging from five to ten years 
impairment of goodwill and loss on disposal of fixed assets 
impairment of goodwill decreased to zero during fiscal from million during fiscal in march  we determined that impairment existed and wrote off the entire balance of goodwill and other intangible assets 
an analysis was performed at that date and indicated that the carrying values of such assets had been fully impaired under sfas the analysis was performed as several impairment indicators had occurred during the march quarter as discussed below 
one of the significant impairment indicators related to a change in outlook for business at cree microwave related to the supply agreement between cree microwave and spectrian 
under the original terms of the agreement  if cree microwave were unable to supply components deemed competitive with components available from third party suppliers within a certain period  spectrian s quarterly minimum purchase commitment would be reduced each quarter by the dollar volume of the component that spectrian purchased from other vendors 
cree microwave and spectrian agreed to enter into the first amendment to the supply agreement in october because cree microwave was delayed in fully qualifying and completing development of its new ldmos technology 
technology similar to ldmos was made available to spectrian from a competitor in early as a result  cree microwave agreed to reduce spectrian s commitments for the december quarter 
in addition  we amended the supply agreement to provide that if competitive components meeting the applicable requirements were not available from cree microwave on or after april   spectrian s quarterly minimum purchase commitment thereafter would be reduced by any purchases of such products from other vendors 
by march  cree microwave had not yet completed development and qualification testing of any of the components using its ldmos based transistors and thus had not released the components to 
table of contents production 
cree microwave then executed a second amendment to the supply agreement with spectrian in march and agreed to reduce minimum quarterly purchase commitments from spectrian in return for additional time in which to complete development and qualification testing of the ldmos components 
in addition  many of the products that spectrian indicated that it would purchase in the future had not yet been released to production 
under the amended supply agreement with spectrian if cree microwave was not able to produce ldmos devices in a timely manner  revenue from spectrian would be significantly reduced after the june quarter 
in addition  the outlook for acquiring additional customers decreased due to the overall weakened economy and the length of qualification cycles 
due to the change in outlook for business at cree microwave and the reduction in expected revenue per quarter  we performed an asset impairment analysis under sfas as a result of this analysis  the full amount of goodwill and intangible assets of million was written off and recorded as impairment of goodwill under operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
please refer to the business combinations section under goodwill and intangible assets note  summary of significant accounting policies and other matters  in the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further information about the valuation of cree microwave 
loss on the disposal of fixed assets decreased to million in fiscal from million recorded in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a million write down for fixed assets associated with a novel epitaxy equipment project that we discontinued before the equipment was delivered to us 
the amount represented a deposit that we paid for the equipment 
we also disposed of  of other assets during the year 
during fiscal  we took a million charge to write down fixed assets due to decisions made based on changes in technology 
this impairment reflected management s decision to focus our technology in certain directions based on feedback from our research and development teams 
after extensively testing certain reactor technology equipment  we narrowed a preference for certain processes  and as a result  we wrote off non producing reactor equipment that did not use the preferred processes 
also  in december  management prepared for a three inch wafer transition and as a result  wrote off non convertible two inch crystal growth equipment that was not being used 
finally  yield improvements in our existing facility also resulted in the obsolescence of certain other equipment 
all equipment written off in the second quarter of fiscal was dismantled and destroyed  if proprietary in nature  or sold by june severance charges and other operating expense 
severance charges declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we incurred  of severance charges at our cree microwave segment 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an  severance charge also associated with cree microwave 
in both periods we recorded the severance charge in the same period that the employees were laid off and received their severance payments 
other operating expense decreased to zero in fiscal from  in fiscal this reduction was primarily caused by a  one time retention bonus paid to cree microwave employees pursuant to a contractual commitment made as a part of the acquisition of cree microwave from spectrian in the second quarter of fiscal other operating income gain on termination of supply agreement 
gain on termination of supply agreement increased to million in fiscal from zero in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we received a million one time payment from spectrian associated with the termination of the supply agreement between cree microwave and spectrian 
loss on investments in marketable securities and loss on long term investments 
loss on investments in marketable securities declined to million in fiscal from million recorded in fiscal the million recorded in fiscal related to marketable securities that we sold during the second quarter of fiscal the million loss recorded in fiscal related to an entry to reclassify other comprehensive losses from equity to loss on investments in marketable securities in our 
table of contents consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we also recorded additional write downs for other than temporary declines in the market value of these investments in these companies as well as the overall stock market decline 
this charge was partially offset by a gain on the sale of marketable trading securities of  loss on long term investments declined to zero in fiscal from million recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded write downs for some investments we had made in privately held companies as many of the companies were experiencing deteriorating financial conditions and or an inability to raise additional capital  which represented significant indicators of value impairment 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a write down of million in privately held investments 
the majority of the write down was taken on our investment in xemod based on data regarding the company s valuation 
we recorded an million write down on the investment to bring the market capitalization estimate for the entire company to million 
in  a third party purchased xemod for approximately million 
we also took an additional million write down on our investment in lighthouse based on data regarding the company s valuation 
a million write down was also taken on our investment in world theatre  inc world theatre based on data regarding the company s valuation 
world theatre also attempted to raise capital during the december quarter and only raised one half of the amount expected in a convertible debt round 
in the fourth quarter of  we wrote down an additional million related to our privately held investments 
our investment in emf ireland limited emf was fully written down by million based on data regarding the company s valuation 
we further wrote down our lighthouse investment by million  based on data regarding the company s valuation 
during the fourth quarter of  we also fully wrote down our investment in world theatre based on data regarding the company s valuation 
the amount of the additional write down was million 
world theatre filed for bankruptcy protection in a million charge was also taken to fully write down our investment in kyma technologies inc kyma based on data regarding the company s valuation 
other non operating income 
other non operating income increased to  in fiscal from zero in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we received a contractually agreed upon payment from one of our customers  representing a settlement for a foreign currency translation adjustment included in our sales contract 
interest income  net 
interest income  net decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the reduction resulted primarily from lower interest rates available for our liquid cash over the applicable period 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to a million tax benefit recorded in fiscal the income tax benefit resulted from the million net pre tax loss resulting mainly from the charges taken during the period 
these charges included write downs for the impairment of fixed assets of million  a million charge to reserve for the decline in value of investments in privately held companies  a million write down for other than temporary declines in the fair market value of our marketable securities  a million write down of goodwill and other intangibles and a million reserve taken for inventory and other items 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to a rate during fiscal due to greater tax benefits in fiscal associated with the losses reported in that year 
at june   we recorded million in net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations  to date  through sales of equity  bank borrowings and from product and contract gross profits 
as of june   we had working capital of million  including million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments held to maturity 
as of june   we held 
table of contents investments of million in long term securities held to maturity in order to receive a higher interest rate on our cash and investments 
operating activities generated million in fiscal compared with million generated during fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to our increased profitability in fiscal as net income grew to million 
included in the increase in cash from operations is a non cash charge of million related to deferred income taxes 
during fiscal  we generated million from managing our working capital 
we normally target our accounts receivable balance to average between and days outstanding  however  through focused collection efforts we decreased our days sales outstanding to days at june  versus days outstanding at june   based on our monthly revenue profile calculation 
therefore  while our overall revenues increased for fiscal  our accounts receivable balance only grew or million 
our inventory remained low at days on hand versus days at june   and therefore our inventory balance only grew million or during fiscal depreciation and amortization increased by million in fiscal due to new equipment purchased to support our business growth 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million 
net investments of million were made in securities held to maturity and million was invested in property and equipment and in additional deposits for property and equipment 
the majority of the increase in spending related to new equipment additions to increase manufacturing capacity in our crystal growth  epitaxy  clean room  die test and xlamp manufacturing areas 
we spent million on the atmi gan business acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal finally  million was invested in patents and the purchase of patent rights resulting mostly from the purchase of patents from asea brown boveri  ltd 
and other patent investments 
cash used in financing activities included the repurchase of million of our common stock and was partly offset by the receipt of million for the exercise of stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase program 
we target approximately to million in capital spending in fiscal  which is greater than fiscal the capital additions will be primarily for equipment to increase our led chip production capacity and continued investment in the high power packaged led xlamp line 
we also target to spend million and hire new employees over the next five years 
we anticipate that cash from operations will fund the majority of our expenditures 
we target that our cash from operations will be higher in fiscal than it was in fiscal due to higher profitability resulting from greater targeted revenue 
therefore  we plan to meet the cash needs for the business for fiscal through cash from operations and cash on hand 
we also anticipate that long term cash needs will be met with cash flow from operations or cash on hand over the next two fiscal years 
actual results may differ from our targets for a number of reasons as we discuss herein 
we may also issue additional shares of common stock for the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets 
from time to time  we evaluate potential acquisitions in complementary businesses as strategic opportunities and anticipate continuing to make such evaluations 
as of june   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held to maturity combined increased by million or over balances reported as of june  due to increased cash flow from operations 
our accounts receivable balance increased by million or over the accounts receivable balance as of june   which resulted from the overall increase in revenue offset partly by strong collections management during fiscal our revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  which was higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal revenue of million 
our net property and equipment has also increased by million or since june  due to investments made to expand production capacity 
these investments are intended to aid us in meeting current and what we view as increasing future customer product demands on a cost effective basis 
we target that these investments in additional equipment will allow us to meet any increase in demand for our products and thus may lead to higher revenue for us 
the higher property investment will also result in higher depreciation expense 
net deferred income taxes changed by million due to accelerated depreciation and taxes on unrealized gains 
other assets declined by million or since june   while marketable 
table of contents securities available for sale increased by million or since the end of fiscal due to the reclassification of our color kinetics investment  subsequent to the public offering of color kinetics common stock  from other assets on our consolidated balance sheet valued at cost of million to marketable securities available for sale 
consequently  the investment is now recorded at fair market value under sfas no 
the net unrecognized gain of million has been recorded as a comprehensive income item in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet 
this million reclassification from other assets was offset by a million increase in deposits that were related to fixed asset additions 
our deferred revenue account increased by million to million at june  as a result of the terms of our agreements with sumitomo and osram  which require us to establish reserves at the time we ship led products to sumitomo and osram based upon a percentage of the total purchase price of such products 
contractual obligations at june   payments to be made pursuant to significant contractual obligations are as follows s omitted contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total purchase obligations are generally for the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business such as raw materials  supplies and capital equipment 
we use blanket purchase orders to communicate expected requirements to certain of our vendors 
purchase obligations reflect vendor commitments under purchase orders where the commitments are firm 
operating leases include rental amounts due on our four leased facilities 
these facilities are comprised of both office and manufacturing space 
the first facility has a remaining lease term for approximately seven and one half years 
the second facility lease expires in approximately six years 
the third and fourth leases are for sales offices that expire in june and july  respectively 
we are also subject to a transition services agreement with atmi  pursuant to which atmi licensed a portion of its facility to us for our use through april all of the remaining lease agreements provide for rental adjustments for increases in base rent up to specific limits property taxes and general property maintenance that would be recorded as rent expense if applicable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of june   we held a long term investment in the equity securities of color kinetics  which is treated for accounting purposes under sfas as available for sale securities 
this investment is carried at fair market value based upon quoted market price of that investment as of june   with net unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
it is our policy to write down these types of equity investments to their market value and record the related write down as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations if we believe that an other than temporary decline existed in our marketable equity securities 
as of june   we do not believe that an other than temporary decline existed in our investment in color kinetics as the market value of the security was above our cost 
this investment is subject to market risk of equity price changes 
the fair market value of this investment as of june   using the closing sale price as of june   was million 

table of contents as of june   we hold investments in the equity of private companies valued at million  with our investment in lighthouse being the only remaining investment that has a net carrying value recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
an adverse movement of equity market prices would likely have an impact on our investment in lighthouse  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
such a movement and the related underlying economic conditions could negatively affect the prospects of lighthouse  its ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize this investment through liquidity events such as initial public offerings  mergers and private sales 
we hold and expect to continue to consider investments in minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
we generally are not subject to material market risk with respect to our investments classified as marketable securities as such investments are readily marketable  liquid and do not fluctuate substantially from stated values 
many of our investments are in early stage companies or technology companies where operations are not yet sufficient to establish them as profitable concerns 
one of our investments is in a publicly traded company whose share prices are subject to market risk 
management continues to evaluate its investment positions on an ongoing basis 
see note  investments in the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further information on our policies regarding investments in private and public companies 
we have invested some of the proceeds from our january public offering into high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities and other investments at fixed interest rates that vary by security 
these investments are a grade or better in accordance with our cash management policy 
at june   we had million invested in these securities 
although these securities generally earn interest at fixed rates  the historical fair values of such investments have not differed materially from the amounts reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
therefore  we believe that potential changes in future interest rates will not create material exposure for us from differences between the fair values and the amortized cost of these investments 
we currently have no debt outstanding 
with two of our larger customers  we maintain a foreign currency adjustment to our sales price if certain exchange rates against the us dollar are not maintained 
during fiscal and fiscal  we recognized  and  respectively  of other non operating income associated with proceeds received from one of these customers for foreign currency adjustments 
these revenue adjustments represent our main risk with respect to foreign currency  since our contracts and purchase orders are denominated in us dollars 
we have no commodity risk 
certain business risks and uncertainties described below are various risks and uncertainties that may affect our business 
these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  both known and unknown  including ones that we currently deem immaterial or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general  may also affect our business 
if any of the risks described below actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our operating results and margins may fluctuate significantly 
although we experienced significant revenue and earnings growth in the past year  we may not be able to sustain such growth or maintain our margins  and we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenue  earnings and margins in the future 
for example  historically  the prices of our leds have declined based on market trends 
we attempt to maintain our margins by constantly developing improved or new products  which command higher prices or by lowering the cost of our leds 
if we are unable to do so  our margins will decline 
our operating results and margins may vary significantly in the future due to many factors  including the following our ability to develop  manufacture and deliver products in a timely and cost effective manner  variations in the amount of usable product produced during manufacturing our yield  
table of contents our ability to improve yields and reduce costs in order to allow lower product pricing without margin reductions  our ability to ramp up production for our new products  our ability to convert our substrates used in our volume manufacturing to larger diameters  our ability to produce higher brightness and more efficient led products that satisfy customer design requirements  our ability to develop new products to specifications that meet the evolving needs of our customers  our ability to generate customer demand for our ldmos products and ramp up production of those products accordingly  changes in demand for our products and our customers products  effects of an economic slow down on consumer spending on such items as cell phones  electronic devices and automobiles 
changes in the competitive landscape  such as higher brightness led products  higher volume production and lower pricing from asian competitors  declining average sales prices for our products  changes in the mix of products we sell  inventions by others companies of new technology that may make our products obsolete  product returns or exchanges that could impact our short term results  changes in purchase commitments permitted under our contracts with large customers  changes in production capacity and variations in the utilization of that capacity  disruptions of manufacturing as a result of damage to our manufacturing facilities from causes such as fire  flood or other casualties  particularly in the case of our single site for sic wafer and led production  our policy to fully reserve for all accounts receivable balances that are more than days past due  which could impact our short term results  and changes in federal budget priorities could adversely affect our contract revenue 
these or other factors could adversely affect our future operating results and margins 
if our future operating results  or margins are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors  our stock price will likely decline 
our led revenues are highly dependent on our customers ability to source or develop efficient phosphor solutions to enable them to use our led chips to produce competitive white led products 
some of our customers package our blue leds with a phosphor coating to create white leds 
nichia currently has the majority of the market share for white leds because it has developed a white led lamp solution that includes an efficient phosphor solution to create a bright white output and it has a number of patents that cover portions of the technology 
the phosphor solutions that our customers use in their products are generally not as efficient as the phosphor solution that nichia uses in its products 
as a result  the white leds that our customers produce historically have not been as bright as nichia s white leds 
we are assisting our customers in their efforts to develop or gain access to more competitive phosphor solutions 
even if our customers are able to develop or secure more competitive phosphor solutions  there can be no assurance that they will be able to compete with nichia  which has an established market presence 
growth in sales of our high brightness led chips used in these applications is dependant upon our customers ability to develop  secure and implement more competitive phosphor solutions 

table of contents we are highly dependent on trends in mobile appliances to drive a substantial percentage of led demand 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by reduced customer demand for led products for use in mobile appliances 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we derived nearly one half of our led revenue and approximately of our overall revenue from sales of our products into mobile appliance applications 
our ability to maintain or increase our led product revenue depends in part on the number of models into which our customers design our products and the overall demand for these products 
also  design cycles in the handset industry are short and demand is volatile  which makes production planning difficult to forecast 
however  our design wins are spread over a broad model and customer base 
if we experience poor production yields  our margins could decline and our operating results may suffer 
our sic and gan materials products and our led  power and rf device products are manufactured using technologies that are highly complex 
we manufacture our sic wafer products from bulk sic crystals  and we use these sic wafers to manufacture our led products and our sic based rf and power semiconductors 
our cree microwave subsidiary manufactures its rf semiconductors on silicon wafers purchased from others 
during our manufacturing process  each wafer is processed to contain numerous die  which are the individual semiconductor devices  and the rf  power devices and xlamp products are further processed by incorporating them into packages for sale as packaged components 
the number of usable crystals  wafers  dies and packaged components that result from our production processes can fluctuate as a result of many factors  including but not limited to the following impurities in the materials used  contamination of the manufacturing environment  equipment failure  power outages or variations in the manufacturing process  lack of adequate quality and quantity of piece parts and other raw materials  losses from broken wafers or human errors  and defects in packaging either within our control or at our subcontractors 
we refer to the proportion of usable product produced at each manufacturing step relative to the gross number that could be constructed from the materials used as our manufacturing yield 
if our yields decrease  our margins could decline and our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have experienced difficulties in achieving acceptable yields on new products  which has adversely affected our operating results 
we may experience similar problems in the future  and we cannot predict when they may occur or their severity 
for example  in the upcoming fiscal year  we may encounter short term yield challenges in our led production as we convert the majority of our production from two inch wafers to three inch wafers 
in some instances  we may offer products for future delivery at prices based on planned yield improvements 
reduced yields or failure to achieve planned yield improvements could significantly affect our future margins and operating results 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and have evolving technology standards 
the markets for our led  rf and microwave  and power semiconductor products are highly competitive 
in the led market  we compete with companies that manufacture or sell nitride based led chips as well as those that sell packaged leds 
competitors are offering new uv  blue  green and white leds with aggressive prices and improved performance 
in the rf power semiconductor field  the products manufactured by cree microwave compete with products offered by substantially larger competitors who 
table of contents have dominated the market to date based on product quality and pricing 
the market for sic wafers is also becoming competitive as other firms in recent years have begun offering sic wafer products or announced plans to do so 
we also expect significant competition for our other products  such as those for use in microwave communications and power switching 
we expect competition to increase 
this could mean lower prices for our products  reduced demand for our products and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development  engineering and manufacturing costs 
competitors also could invent new technologies that may make our products obsolete 
any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
litigation and sec matters could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we and certain of our officers and current or former directors are defendants in pending litigation as described in item legal proceedings of this report that alleges  among other things  violations of federal securities laws 
defending against existing and potential securities and class action litigation will likely require significant attention and resources and  regardless of the outcome  result in significant legal expenses  which will adversely affect our results unless covered by insurance or recovered from third parties 
if our defenses are ultimately unsuccessful  or if we are unable to achieve a favorable resolution  we could be liable for damage awards that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the sec in july initiated an informal inquiry of us and requested that we voluntarily provide certain information to the sec staff 
we have cooperated with the sec in this informal inquiry 
if the sec elects to pursue a formal investigation of us  responding to any such investigation and any resulting enforcement action could require significant diversion of management s attention and resources in the future as well as significant legal expense and exposure to possible penalties or fines that could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
our business and our ability to produce our products may be impaired by claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others 
vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights characterize the semiconductor industry 
these traits have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
litigation to determine the validity of patents or claims by third parties of infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management  even if the litigation results in a determination favorable to us 
in the event of an adverse result in such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  indemnify our customers  stop the manufacture  use and sale of products found to be infringing  discontinue the use of processes found to be infringing  expend significant resources to develop non infringing products and processes  and or obtain a license to use third party technology 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not attempt to assert infringement claims against us with respect to our current or future products 
from time to time we receive correspondence asserting that our products or processes are or may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
our practice is to investigate such claims to determine whether the assertions have merit and  if so  we take appropriate steps to seek to obtain a license or to avoid the infringement 
however  we cannot predict 
table of contents whether a license will be available or that we would find the terms of any license offered acceptable or commercially reasonable 
failure to obtain a necessary license could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and costs and to suspend the manufacture of products 
there are limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
our intellectual property position is based in part on patents owned by us and patents exclusively licensed to us by ncsu  boston university and others 
the licensed patents include patents relating to the sic crystal growth process that is central to our sic materials and device business 
we intend to continue to file patent applications in the future  where appropriate  and to pursue such applications with us and foreign patent authorities 
however  we cannot be sure that patents will be issued on such applications or that our existing or future patents will not be successfully contested by third parties 
also  since issuance of a valid patent does not prevent other companies from using alternative  non infringing technology  we cannot be sure that any of our patents or patents issued to others and licensed to us will provide significant commercial protection  especially as new competitors enter the market 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on trade secrets and other non patented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities 
we try to protect this information through appropriate efforts to maintain its secrecy  including requiring employees and third parties to sign confidentiality agreements 
we cannot be sure that these efforts will be successful or that the confidentiality agreements will not be breached 
we also cannot be sure that we would have adequate remedies for any breach of such agreements or other misappropriation of our trade secrets  or that our trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others 
where necessary  we may initiate litigation to enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights 
for example  this past fiscal year we settled a patent infringement action that our cree lighting subsidiary and the trustees of boston university filed against axt  inc  seeking enforcement of a patent relating to semiconductor devices manufactured using a gan based buffer technology 
any such litigation may require us to spend a substantial amount of time and money and could distract management from our day to day operations 
moreover  there is no assurance that we will be successful in any such litigation 
if we are unable to produce and sell adequate quantities of our high brightness and mid brightness led chip products and improve our yields  our operating results may suffer 
we believe that our ability to gain customer acceptance of our high brightness and mid brightness led chip products and to achieve higher volume production and lower production costs for those products  will be important to our future operating results 
we must reduce costs of these products to avoid margin reductions from the lower selling prices we may offer due to our competitive environment and or to satisfy prior contractual commitments 
achieving greater volumes and lower costs requires improved production yields for these products 
we are continuing to work with our customers to develop and expand our xbright products to help meet their market and packaging requirements 
we may encounter manufacturing difficulties as we ramp up our capacity to make our newest products 
our failure to produce adequate quantities and improve the yields of any of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
some of our customers may encounter difficulties with their manufacturing processes using our xbright and xthin devices due to the non standard die attachment processes required  which could increase product returns and impact customer demand  each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our operating results are substantially dependent on the development of new products based on our sic and gan technology 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop new sic and gan solutions for existing and new markets 
we must introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner  and we must secure production orders from our customers 
the development of new sic and gan products is a highly complex process  and we historically have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
products currently under development include larger  higher quality substrates and epitaxy  high power rf and microwave devices in both sic and gan  sic power devices  near uv laser diodes  higher brightness  thinner led products and high powered packaged leds 
the successful development and introduction of these products depends on a number of factors  including the following achievement of technology breakthroughs required to make commercially viable devices  the accuracy of our predictions of market requirements and evolving standards  acceptance of our new product designs  the availability of qualified development personnel  our timely completion of product designs and development  our ability to develop repeatable processes to manufacture new products in sufficient quantities for commercial sales  our customers ability to develop applications incorporating our products  and acceptance of our customers products by the market 
if any of these or other factors become problematic  we may not be able to develop and introduce these new products in a timely or cost efficient manner 
we must generate new customer demand for our ldmos products in order to offset expenses of our cree microwave segment 
revenues of our cree microwave segment will depend on our ability to attract new customers for our ldmos products 
due to the current market environment for microwave devices and the lengthy customer design in and qualification process for our ldmos products  it may take many quarters to develop new customers for our cree microwave segment and we may not succeed in doing so 
until we develop sufficient new business for cree microwave s products  our expenses for this segment will exceed its revenues 
we depend on a few large customers and our revenues can be affected by their contract terms 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenue has come from large purchases by a small number of customers 
accordingly  our future operating results depend on the success of our largest customers and on our success in selling large quantities of our products to them 
the concentration of our revenues with a few large customers makes us particularly dependent on factors affecting those customers 
for example  if demand for their products decreases  they may limit or stop purchasing our products and our operating results could suffer 
in addition  our sumitomo contract provides that sumitomo may decrease its purchase commitment or terminate the contract if its inventory of our products reaches a specified level 
the contract also requires us to establish two rolling reserves based upon a percentage of the total purchase price of our products 
we defer revenue recognition on the amounts added to reserves 
if claims are made against reserves  we may recognize lesser amounts of revenue or no revenue on substitute sales to sumitomo and any product returned may not be salable at the same price or at all 
another example is our osram contract  which allows osram to decrease its purchase commitment if we do not offer prices at certain specified levels or as agreed to by the parties 
contract terms with other large customers also operate in a manner that could have a negative impact on our financial results 

table of contents we face significant challenges managing our growth 
we have experienced a period of significant growth that has challenged our management and other resources 
we have grown from employees on june  to  employees on june  and from revenues of million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to implement and improve operating systems  maintain adequate manufacturing facilities and equipment to meet customer demand  improve the skills and capabilities of our current management team  add experienced senior level managers  and attract and retain qualified people with experience in engineering  design and technical marketing support 
we will spend substantial amounts of money in supporting our growth and may have additional unexpected costs 
we may not be able to expand quickly enough to exploit potential market opportunities 
our future operating results will also depend on expanding sales and marketing  research and development  and administrative support 
if we cannot attract qualified people or manage growth effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
performance of our investments in other companies could negatively affect our financial condition 
from time to time  we have made investments in public and private companies that engage in complementary businesses 
should the value of any such investments we hold decline  the related write down in value could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  if the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the related write down could have a material adverse effect on our reported net income 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a non operating charge of million pre tax relating to the declines in the value of equity investments determined to be other than temporary as a result of continued depressed market conditions 
on june   we held interests in one public company as well as several private companies 
each of these investments is subject to the risks inherent in the business of the company in which we have invested and to trends affecting the equity markets as a whole 
our private company investments are subject to additional risks relating to the limitations on transferability of our interests due to the lack of a public market and to other transfer restrictions 
our investment in a publicly held company exposes us to market risks and could be subject to contractual limitations on transferability 
for example  we are restricted from selling our shares in color kinetics for a period of days from june   the date of their initial public offering 
as a result  we may not be able to reduce the size of our positions or liquidate our investments when we deem appropriate to limit our downside risk 
our manufacturing capacity may not be sufficient to keep up with customer demand 
we experienced significant growth in fiscal and are operating near capacity for led products 
although we are taking steps to address our manufacturing capacity concerns  if we are not able to increase our capacity quickly enough to respond to customer demand or if our expansion plans are not adequate enough to address our capacity constraints  or if ramping up new capacity costs more than we anticipate  our business and results of operation could be adversely affected 
as part of our initiative to address these capacity concerns  we are in the process of transitioning our production process in several ways 
first  we are shifting production of the majority of our led products from two inch wafers to three inch wafers over the course of fiscal we must first qualify our production processes for each product on systems designed to accommodate the larger wafer size  and some of our existing production equipment must be refitted for the larger wafer size 
in the past we have experienced lower yields for a period of time following a transition to a larger wafer size until use of the 
table of contents larger wafer is fully integrated in production and we begin to achieve production efficiency 
we anticipate that we will experience similar temporary yield reductions during the transition to the three inch wafers 
if we experience delays in the qualification process  the transition phase takes longer than we expect  or if we are unable to attain expected yield improvements  our operating results may be adversely affected 
we also are in the process of qualifying our sunnyvale  california location to produce sic schottky diode products and transitioning production of schottky diode products to that location over the next several quarters 
we may experience a transition period as we start to ramp up production in which our yields are low or our production costs do not meet our expectations 
if we experience delays in qualifying this facility for production of sic schottky diodes  if this transition period extends longer than we expect  or if we are not able to achieve the production levels and margins we expect  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we also are exploring ways to expand our manufacturing capacity and plan to make certain expenditures in the coming fiscal year to acquire new equipment 
any potential expansion projects may be delayed  cost more than we anticipate or require long transition periods  any of which could impact our ability to meet our customers demands and affect our operating results 
we rely on a few key suppliers 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials  components  services and equipment used in manufacturing our products  including key materials and equipment used in critical stages of our manufacturing processes 
we generally purchase these limited source items with purchase orders  and we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with such suppliers 
if we were to lose such key suppliers  our manufacturing operations could be interrupted or hampered significantly 
if government agencies or other customers discontinue or curtail their funding for our research and development programs our business may suffer 
changes in federal budget priorities could adversely affect our contract revenue 
in the past  government agencies and other customers have funded a significant portion of our research and development activities 
government contracts are subject to the risk that the government agency may not appropriate and allocate all funding contemplated by the contract 
in addition  our government contracts generally permit the contracting authority to terminate the contracts for the convenience of the government  and the full value of the contracts would not be realized if they are prematurely terminated 
furthermore  we may be unable to incur sufficient allowable costs to generate the full estimated contract values  and there is some risk that any technologies developed under these contracts may not have commercial value 
if government and customer funding is discontinued or reduced  our ability to develop or enhance products could be limited  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if our products fail to perform or meet customer requirements  we could incur significant additional costs 
the manufacture of our products involves highly complex processes 
our customers specify quality  performance and reliability standards that we must meet 
if our products do not meet these standards  we may be required to replace or rework the products 
in some cases our products may contain undetected defects or flaws that only become evident after shipment 
we have experienced product quality  performance or reliability problems from time to time 
defects or failures may occur in the future 
if failures or defects occur  we could lose revenue  incur increased costs  such as warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  
table of contents experience delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products  write down existing inventory  or experience product returns 
we are subject to risks from international sales 
sales to customers located outside the us accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect that revenue from international sales will continue to be the majority of our total revenue 
international sales are subject to a variety of risks  including risks arising from currency fluctuations  trading restrictions  tariffs  trade barriers and taxes 
also  us government export controls could restrict or prohibit the exportation of products with defense applications 
because all of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  our prices become less competitive in countries with currencies that are low or are declining in value against the us dollar 
if we fail to evaluate and implement strategic opportunities successfully  our business may suffer 
from time to time we evaluate strategic opportunities available to us for product  technology or business acquisitions 
for example  in fiscal we acquired the gallium nitride substrate and epitaxy business of atmi 
if we choose to make an acquisition  we face certain risks  such as failure of the acquired business in meeting our performance expectations  diversion of management attention  retention of existing customers of the acquired business  and difficulty in integrating the acquired business s operations  personnel and financial and operating systems into our current business 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks or any other problems that arise from our recent or future acquisitions 
any failure to successfully evaluate strategic opportunities and address risks or other problems that arise related to any acquisition could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
these or other factors could adversely affect our future operating results and margins 
if our future operating results  or margins are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors  our stock price may decline
