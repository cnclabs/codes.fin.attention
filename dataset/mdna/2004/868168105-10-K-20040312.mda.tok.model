consolidated net sales increased million to million in from million in aluminum wheel sales increased million in to million from million a year ago  a percent increase compared to the percent increase in unit shipments  due to the average selling price of our wheels increasing approximately percent 
an increase in the pass through price of aluminum increased the average selling price by approximately percent and the shift in mix to larger and chrome plated wheels during  net of price discounts to our customers  increased the average selling price by an additional percent 
consolidated net sales in also included million of aluminum suspension component sales  which prior to had been included in a separate line item in the consolidated statement of income  but are now included in consolidated net sales 
shipments to ford motor company ford and general motors corporation gm totaled percent of total oem unit shipments in compared to percent a year ago 
the balance of unit shipments to daimlerchrysler and to our international customers totaled percent and percent  respectively  compared to percent and percent  respectively  in the increase of percent in oem aluminum wheel unit shipments in compares favorably to a decrease of percent in north american automotive production of passenger cars and light trucks  indicating further market share gains in this is principally due to our winning major new wheel contracts and  to a lesser extent  the increasing aluminum wheel penetration rate 
according to ward s automotive yearbook  an auto industry publication  aluminum wheel installation rates on automobiles and light trucks in the us rose to percent for the model year 
aluminum wheel installation rates have increased to this level since the mid s  when this rate was only percent 
however  in recent years  this rate has slowed  increasing only percent from percent for the model year  a trend which we expect to continue 
accordingly  future growth will be more dependent upon additional wheel contracts 
consolidated net sales in increased million  or percent  to million from million in oem wheel sales increased to million from million in  in line with the percent increase in unit shipments 
the increase in oem aluminum wheel shipments in compared favorably to the increase of percent in north american automotive production of passenger cars and light trucks 
the average selling price of our wheels in increased approximately percent from  as a shift in mix to larger wheels  net of price discounts to our customers  increased the 
table of contents average selling price by approximately percent  offsetting a decrease of approximately percent due to the decline in the pass through price of aluminum 
sales of our aftermarket product lines in declined to approximately million from million in  due to discontinuance of certain product lines that were not replaced and to the continued consolidation of customers and the resulting increased pricing pressures put on suppliers in that industry 
for these reasons  in january we discontinued selling aftermarket products and sold the remaining inventory to the president of that business  who formed a new entity 
the discontinuance and subsequent sale of these product lines did not have  nor will it have  a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
gross profit during  gross profit decreased million to million  or percent of net sales  from million  or percent of net sales  in beginning with the first quarter of  the operating results of the aluminum suspension components business are no longer shown as a separate line item in the statement of income and are included in the determination of gross profit 
this change reduced gross profit in by million  or percent of net sales  representing the loss experienced in that business 
the principal factors impacting gross profit were continued customer price reductions and decreases in certain high volume  high profit specialty wheels 
to a lesser extent  our gross profit was also impacted by decreased utilization rates in our us manufacturing facilities while three of the plants were being expanded  extra costs and inefficiencies related to these plant expansions  and additional costs and delays related to a record number of new wheel program launches 
additionally  the difference between the market price and the fixed price of aluminum delivered during pursuant to our aluminum contracts negatively impacted gross profit 
during the fourth quarter of  all future aluminum purchase commitments were liquidated at a price that approximated contract value 
during  gross profit increased million to million  or percent of net sales  from million  or percent of net sales  in the major items impacting gross profit included increased utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities  resulting in a higher absorption of fixed costs  and increased demand for chrome plated and polished wheels 
these positive factors more than offset the impact on gross profit of the changing price of aluminum  as discussed below 
manufacturing facility utilization rates in were impacted favorably by increased customer demand for the aluminum wheels that we supply for the production of passenger cars and light trucks in north america 
additionally  our second aluminum wheel manufacturing facility in chihuahua  mexico  which had been included in pre production costs prior to the fourth quarter of  increased its utilization significantly during gross profit in was negatively impacted by the portion of our aluminum raw material requirements that were purchased under fixed price contracts at prices higher than the current market price 
during the same period  selling prices to our customers were decreased to reflect the change in current market prices of aluminum  as described below 
the overall decrease in our average selling price was at a greater rate than the decrease in our average purchase price for aluminum during the period 
the cost of aluminum is a significant component in the overall cost of a wheel 
additionally  a portion of our selling prices to oem customers is attributable to the cost of aluminum 
our selling prices are adjusted periodically to current aluminum market conditions based upon market price changes during specific pricing periods 
theoretically  assuming selling price adjustments and raw material purchase prices move at the same rate  as the price of aluminum increases  the effect is an overall decrease in the gross margin percentage  since the gross profit in absolute dollars would be the same 
the opposite would then be true in periods during which the price of aluminum decreases 

table of contents however  since the pricing periods during which selling prices are adjusted for changes in the market prices of aluminum differ for each of our customers  and the selling price changes are fixed for various periods  our selling price adjustments do not entirely offset the increases or decreases experienced in our aluminum raw material purchase prices 
this is especially true during periods of frequent increases or decreases in the market price of aluminum  and when a portion of our aluminum purchases is via long term fixed purchase agreements 
accordingly  our gross profit is subject to fluctuations  since the change in the aluminum content of selling prices does not necessarily match the change in the aluminum raw material purchase prices during the period being reported 
other factors impacting our gross margin percentage are the continued pricing pressures from our customers and increasing global industry wide competition 
pricing pressures have intensified as suppliers in asia  eastern europe and other areas of the world enter the market and competitors become more aggressive in their efforts to fill open plant capacity 
while we have ongoing programs to reduce costs and  in the past  have been successful in substantially mitigating these pricing pressures  it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so without impacting margins 
we will continue to aggressively implement cost savings strategies to meet customer pricing expectations and industry wide competition in order to maintain our gross profit margins 
however  the impact of these factors on our future financial position and results of operations will initially be negative  the extent of which cannot be predicted  and we may not be able to implement sufficient cost savings strategies to mitigate any future impact 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or percent of net sales in  compared to million  or percent of net sales in and million  or percent of net sales in the increase in absolute dollars in was due primarily to higher compensation costs  principally bonuses  and fringe benefit costs 
start up and pre production costs beginning with the first quarter of  the operating results of our aluminum components business in heber springs  arkansas have been included in the determination of gross profit 
initial start up costs associated with this business totaled million in compared to million in also included in this cost category for the first nine months of were the initial pre production costs of our second aluminum wheel facility in chihuahua  mexico  which totaled million 
interest income in  interest income decreased to million from million in  as the average rate of return on cash invested decreased to percent from percent  which offset the increase in cash available for investment of million 
interest income in decreased to million from million in  as the average rate of return decreased to percent from percent 
equity in earnings of joint ventures our share of the profits of our percent owned joint venture aluminum wheel manufacturing operation in hungary amounted to million in compared to million in  and million in the improvement in profitability in the last two years was due equally to significant increases in the foreign exchange rate of the euro compared to the us dollar  and to manufacturing cost reductions 
in order to meet the expected increase in demand of the european aluminum wheel market  the joint

see note investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this joint venture 
effective income tax rate the consolidated tax rate in remained the same as in at percent of pretax income compared to percent in the change in tax rates since is a result of slight variances in the mix of federal  state and foreign income tax rates

the following table summarizes the cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million in from million in  due to an unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities of million  a decrease in net income of million and unfavorable changes in non cash items of million 
favorable changes in working capital requirements for accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  were offset by an unfavorable change in accounts payable of million  as total accounts payable in decreased million compared to an increase of million in the increase in accounts payable in was due principally to the high level of plant expansion activity in the latter part of that year 
payables related to capital items generally have extended payment terms from the date of receipt until final approval and payment 
the million cash flow from operating activities in  the million in short term investments from a year ago  and the million proceeds from the exercise of company stock options were used for capital expenditures of 
table of contents million  for cash dividends of million  and for common stock repurchases totaling million 
capital expenditures in included expansions of three of our wheel plant facilities in arkansas and kansas  as well as ongoing improvements at our other locations 
in  cash provided by operations increased million to million from million in  due principally to the increase in net income of million and a favorable change in working capital requirements  principally accounts payable 
the million cash flow from operating activities was used for capital expenditures of million  for cash dividends totaling million and to repurchase our common stock for million 
capital expenditures in included the initial expansion of our aluminum wheel facility in rogers  arkansas  as well as ongoing improvements to our other existing facilities 
capital expenditures in included expansion projects at our aluminum wheel manufacturing facilities in pittsburg  kansas and in fayetteville and rogers  arkansas  as well as ongoing improvements at our other existing facilities 
over the past fifteen years  we have expended over million for new plants  expansion programs and ongoing improvements 
the majority of the expansion financing was sourced from internally generated cash flow  to construct and expand our world class road wheel facilities and to continuously improve all of our manufacturing plants 
in  expenditures approximating million are projected for ongoing improvements to our wheel plants and for the aluminum components business 
excluding the potential construction of a new plant and the possibility of a joint venture wheel plant in asia  capital expenditures in and are expected to approximate million in each year 
we anticipate funding these capital expenditures from internally generated cash flow and  to the extent necessary  from existing cash and cash equivalents 
our financial condition remained sound in our working capital  which increased million to million from million at december   includes million in cash and cash equivalents 
the current ratio at year end was  up from a year ago 
accordingly  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of new and complementary business opportunities  to further expand into international markets and to withstand any moderate downturns in the economy 
risk management we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due  in part  to the competitive global nature of the industry in which we operate  to changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products  and to development of new products  such as our aluminum suspension and related underbody components 
we have foreign operations in mexico and hungary that on occasion require the transfer of funds denominated in their respective functional currencies the mexican peso and the euro 
the value of the mexican peso experienced a percent decrease in relation to the us dollar in since  the mexican peso has repeatedly experienced periods of relative stability followed by periods of major decline in value 
the impact of these declines in value relative to our wholly owned subsidiary  superior industries de mexico  sa de cv  has resulted in a cumulative unrealized translation loss at december  of million  which has been included in other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
the mexico facilities currently represent approximately percent of our total net fixed assets 
on january   eleven of fifteen member countries of the european union eu established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the eu s common currency  the euro 
euro currency was issued on january   and on june   all national currencies of the eu member countries became obsolete 
effective january   the functional currency of our percent owned joint venture operation in hungary was converted from the german deutsche mark to the euro 
the 
table of contents conversion to the euro as of that date did not have a material impact on our operations or financial position 
during  the value of the euro experienced a percent increase versus the us dollar 
since our initial investment in this joint venture in  the fluctuations in functional currency rates have resulted in a cumulative unrealized translation loss of million  which has been included in other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
our primary risk exposure relating to derivative financial instruments results from the periodic use of foreign currency forward contracts to offset the impact of currency rate fluctuations with regard to foreign denominated receivables  payables or purchase obligations 
at december   we held open foreign currency euro forward contracts totaling million  with an unrealized gain of million 
at december   we held open foreign currency euro forward contracts totaling million  with an unrealized gain of million 
any unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity until the actual contract settlement date 
percent changes in the euro us dollar exchange rate will impact the unrealized gain loss by a similar percentage of the current market value 
when market conditions warrant  we will also enter into contracts to purchase certain commodities used in the manufacture of our products  such as aluminum  natural gas  environmental emission credits and other raw materials 
any such commodity commitments are expected to be purchased and used over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  they are not accounted for as a derivative 
we currently have several purchase agreements for the delivery of natural gas over the next three years 
the contract value and fair value of these purchase commitments approximated million and million  respectively  at december  as of december   the aggregate contract value and fair value of all purchase commitments were million and million  respectively  including purchase commitments for the delivery of aluminum in and  and purchase commitments for the delivery of natural gas in through the aluminum purchase commitments were delivered as agreed and the aluminum purchase commitments were liquidated in november at a price that approximated our contract price 
percentage changes in the market prices of natural gas will impact the fair value by a similar percentage 
we do not hold or purchase any natural gas forward contracts for trading purposes 
the following schedule summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  amounts in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter commodity contracts retirement plan euro forward contracts operating leases total contractual obligations inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition for the three years ended december  we believe that our purchase commitments and the majority of our customer contracts are structured to reduce the impact of changes caused by inflation 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to apply significant judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein  as well as financial information included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience  industry trends  terms of various past and present agreements and contracts  and information available from other sources that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent through other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results reported in the future will not differ from these estimates  or that future changes in these estimates will not adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies most affected by significant management estimates and judgments revenue recognition 
our products are manufactured to customer specifications under standard purchase orders 
sales of these products and their related costs are recognized when title transfers to the customer  generally upon shipment 
project development revenues for the development of wheels and components and related initial tooling that are reimbursed by our customers are recognized as such related costs and expenses are incurred and recoverability is probable  generally upon issuance of a customer purchase order 
as of december  and  project development costs and expenses not yet billed to customers and included in project development receivables totaled million and million  respectively 
property  plant equipment 
we record all property and equipment at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the useful life of property and equipment and the determination as to what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgments by management 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense if different assumptions were used 
self insurance liability 
we are self insured for a significant portion of our employee benefit  workers compensation and general liability programs 
we do maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit the total exposure for certain of these programs 
the accrued liability associated with these programs is based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as  in the case of workers compensation  claims incurred but not as yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated workers compensation liability is based upon information provided by our insurance brokers and insurers  combined with our judgments regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  claims development history  case jurisdiction  related legislation and our claims settlement practice 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr claims as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results and financial condition could be impacted 

table of contents income taxes 
we provide for income taxes based upon our estimate of federal  state and foreign tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective federal  state and foreign income tax rates  allowable tax credits  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
our estimates are made based on the best information at the time that we prepare our income tax provision 
as these developments evolve  we will update our estimates  which  in turn  could result in an adjustment to our effective tax rate 
our tax returns  which are generally filed many months after our fiscal year end  are subject to audit by federal  state and foreign governments years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of their respective tax laws 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was originally effective on july  in december  the fasb deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of fin to march  for interests held by public companies in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before february  we have completed our evaluation of the provisions of fin and we do not have any significant interests in variable interest entities 
accordingly  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no

the amendments set forth in sfas no 
improve financial reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly 
sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  with a few exceptions and for hedging relationships designated after june  the guidance is to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of this new accounting standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in 
table of contents some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after november  this new accounting standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

the new rules require additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
the required information should be provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans 
the new disclosures are generally effective for calendar year end financial statements of public companies  with a delayed effective date for certain disclosures  for foreign plans  and for non public entities 
this new accounting standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements and risk factors the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward looking  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  including statements contained in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and reports and other public statements to our shareholders 
these statements may  for example  express expectations or projections about future actions or results that we may anticipate but  due to developments beyond our control  do not materialize 
actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those listed below  which  among others  should be considered in evaluating our financial outlook 
we assume no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements 
global pricing 
we continue to experience increased competition in our domestic and international markets 
in addition to the fact that some initial products are being shipped to the us from asia  many of our competitors have excess capacity and  because of their financial condition  are placing intense pricing pressure in our market place 
these competitive pressures are expected to continue and may result in decreased sales volumes and unit price reductions  resulting in lower revenues  gross margin and operating income 
multi year supply agreements with key customers 
ford and gm were our only customers accounting for more than percent of consolidated net sales in gm and ford together represented approximately of our annual sales in and of total sales in the loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to either or both of these two customers would have a significant adverse impact on our financial results unless the lost volume could be replaced 
however  we believe this risk is offset in short term periods due to long term relationships with both  including multi year supply arrangements 
in addition  these arrangements  which are for more than different wheel programs with various divisions of these two customers  expire on differing dates 

table of contents decline in production of passenger cars and light trucks 
a significant decline in the production of passenger cars and or light trucks by automobile manufacturers would adversely affect our revenue and if such decline continues for a sustained period  would have a significant adverse impact on our financial results 
new component products 
we have made a significant investment in research  development and marketing for the automotive suspension and underbody components business 
significant revenue from these investments may not be achieved for a number of years  if at all 
the future success of this business is highly dependent on our ability to obtain additional contract awards  which in part depends on industry conversion to lighter aluminum components 
litigation 
we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits  including product liability and other matters 
while we believe that none of the litigation matters in which we are currently involved will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  it is possible that  even though we believe we have adequate insurance coverage or are likely to prevail on the merits  one or more of these matters could be resolved in a manner that would ultimately have a material impact on our financial condition  and could negatively impact our revenues  operating margins and net income 
international operations 
we manufacture our products in mexico and hungary and sell our products throughout the world 
unfavorable changes in foreign cost structures  trade protection laws  policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investments  social  political  labor  or economic conditions in a specific country or region  including foreign exchange rates  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and foreign tax consequences  among other factors  could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
other 
other issues and uncertainties include changes in us  global or regional economic conditions  currency exchange rates  war or significant terrorist acts  or political instability in major markets  all of which may affect automobile sales  which in turn could cause our customers to cancel orders  as has happened in the past  periodic or sustained shortages of natural gas and other energy sources that may impact our performance and profitability  changes in commodity prices of the materials used in our products  or substantial increases in material costs that may impact the demand for aluminum wheels  changes in the laws  regulations  policies  or other activities of governments  agencies  and similar organizations where such actions may affect our ability to produce products at a competitive price  adverse weather conditions or natural disasters  such as earthquakes  tornados and hurricanes  which may  among other things  impair production at our manufacturing facilities  our ability to attract or retain key employees to operate our manufacturing facilities and corporate office  success of our strategic and operating plans to properly direct the company  including obtaining new contracts for our suspension and underbody components business  and  international  political and military developments that may affect automobile production and sales
