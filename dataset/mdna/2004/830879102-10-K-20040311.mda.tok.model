item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  skywest  operates one of the larger independent regional airlines in the united states 
skywest offers scheduled passenger and air freight service with approximately  daily departures to cities in states and three canadian provinces 
additionally  skywest provides customer handling services for approximately nine other airlines throughout skywest s system 
skywest has been a partner with delta in salt lake city and united in los angeles since and  respectively 
in  skywest expanded its relationship with united to provide service in portland  seattle tacoma  san francisco and in additional los angeles markets 
in  skywest expanded its operations to serve as the delta connection in dallas fort worth 
in april  skywest signed an agreement with continental to supply continental with regional airline feed into continental s houston hub effective on july  today  skywest operates as a delta connection carrier in salt lake city and dallas fort worth  as a united express carrier in los angeles  san francisco  denver and the pacific northwest and as a continental connection carrier in houston 
skywest believes that its success in attracting multiple contractual relationships with major airline partners is attributable to its delivery of high quality customer service with an all cabin class fleet 
as of december   of skywest s capacity measured in asms operated under the delta code  operated under the united code and operated under the continental code 
as of december   skywest operated a fleet of embs and crjs 
on march   delta awarded the company the rights to acquire seven additional crjs  with deliveries currently expected to begin during the first quarter of historically  multiple contractual relationships have enabled skywest to reduce reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of skywest controlled or prorate flying and contract flying 
on contract routes  the major airline partner controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and skywest receives from the major airline partner negotiated payments per block hour or flight departure and incentives related to levels of customer service 
on skywest controlled flights  skywest controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and receives a prorated portion of passenger fares 
the company s embs flown for delta and continental are flown under prorate arrangements 
approximately of the company s embs flown in the united system are flown under contractual arrangements  with the remaining ten percent flown under prorate arrangements 
on september   the company announced the completion of a firm order for  seat crjs for its united express operations with deliveries presently scheduled to begin in january and continue through may on february   the company further amended the order to include additional crjs and two additional crjs  bringing the total order to crjs and crjs during this same delivery period 
the contract also grants to the company options to acquire an additional aircraft that can be delivered in either or seat configurations 
the company presently anticipates that delivery dates for these aircraft could start in june and continue through september  however  actual delivery dates remain subject to final determination as agreed upon by the company and united 
in december  united filed for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
on september   the company announced it had completed negotiations  and signed a long term  year average term definitive contract with united the united express agreement  which had been previously approved on august  by the us bankruptcy court 
subsequently  the united express agreement received all necessary approvals from the creditors committee operating on behalf of united under bankruptcy protection and united s pilot union  the airline pilot association alpa 
notwithstanding the execution of the united express agreement  united s bankruptcy filing could still lead to many other unforeseen expenses  risks and uncertainties 
although united has reported that it intends to emerge from its ongoing chapter bankruptcy  on or before july   it could still file for liquidation under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  or liquidate some or all of its assets through one or more transactions with third parties 
such events  individually or singly  could jeopardize the company s united express operations  leave the company unable to efficiently utilize the additional aircraft which the company is currently obligated to purchase  or result in other outcomes which could have a material adverse effect on the operations  activities and financial condition of the company 
on september   the faa grounded all flights to  from  and within the united states as a result of the terrorist attacks in new york city  washington dc  and pennsylvania 
all airports were closed and did not reopen until september  when flights were permitted to resume  passenger traffic and yields were significantly lower than prior to the attacks 
united reduced its flight schedule to approximately of the schedule it flew prior to september th 
as a result  skywest began to reduce its emb fleet flown under the united code 
during the year ended december   the company terminated certain emb leases early and recorded a million write off of unamortized engine overhauls and an accrual of million for the remaining lease payments related to embs parked as of december  to help compensate airlines for their losses  the us government passed the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the stabilization act 
under the stabilization act  the company received approximately million to help compensate for losses resulting from the terrorist attacks  of which million and million had been recognized as a contra expense in the company s consolidated financial statements as of december  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contained herein 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  aircraft maintenance  aircraft leases and impairment of long lived assets as discussed below 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from such estimates 
revenue recognition passenger and freight revenues are recognized when service is provided 
under the company s contract and prorate flying agreements with delta  united and continental revenue is considered earned when the flight is completed 
the company s flight and related operations conducted under the delta relationship are governed by a ten year agreement signed with delta in during  the company was compensated on a fee per completed block hour basis plus true ups for fuel costs as this is a pass through cost pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
effective august   all emb flights conducted by the company under the delta code were transitioned from contract flying to prorate flying 
under prorate flying arrangement  the company controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and receives a prorated portion of passenger fares 
on september   the company announced it had completed negotiations  and signed the united express agreement  which had been previously approved on august  by the us bankruptcy court 
subsequently  the united express agreement received all the necessary approvals from the creditors committee operating on behalf of united under bankruptcy protection and united s pilot union  the airline pilot association 
under the terms of the united express agreement  the company will be reimbursed primarily on a fee per completed block hour and departure basis plus a margin based on performance incentives  and true ups for fuel costs and property taxes as these are pass through costs pursuant to the agreement 
on april   the company signed a new agreement with continental to supply continental with regional airline feed into its houston hub beginning on july  the company s continental connection operations are currently conducted using the company s embs and embs leased from continental 
the continental agreement provides for payment to the company of a prorated portion of passenger fares  plus a minimal amount if minimal load factors aren t experienced 
the agreements with delta  united and continental contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the respective agreements  subject to certain rights of the other party  if certain performance criteria are not maintained 
the company s agreement with delta permits delta to terminate the agreement without cause upon days notice 
the company s rights under the united express agreement expire incrementally between and  however  united can terminate the agreement without notice if the company does not perform at certain levels 
the agreement with continental can be terminated by either party upon days notice 
the company s revenues could be impacted by a number of factors  including changes to the agreements  the annual negotiations and the company s ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under the agreements 
in the event that the company s contractual rates have not been finalized at quarterly and or annual report dates  the company records revenues based on a prior period s approved rates  adjusted to reflect management s current estimate of the results of these negotiations 
if the contractual rates differ from those estimated by management  the company will reflect these changes in future condensed consolidated financial statements upon finalization of negotiations 
the company s results of operations included a positive pretax amount of million  or per diluted share  resulting from adjustments made to reflect the company s actual operating results from flights under the united express agreement  which were more favorable to the company than the rates and expenses estimated by the company prior to the execution of the united express agreement 
maintenance the company operates under an faa approved continuous inspection and maintenance program 
the company s historical maintenance accounting policy for engine overhaul costs has included a combination of accruing for overhaul costs on a per flight hour basis at rates estimated to be sufficient to cover the overhauls the accrual method and capitalizing the cost of engine overhauls and expensing the capitalized cost over the estimated useful life of the overhaul the deferral method 
through december   the company used the deferral method of accounting for emb engines and was using the accrual method for crj engines 
as discussed below  during the quarter ended march   the company elected to change its method of accounting for crj engine overhauls to expensing overhaul maintenance events as incurred the direct expense method 
the costs of maintenance for airframe and avionics components  landing gear and normal recurring maintenance are expensed as incurred 
for leased aircraft  the company is subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the life of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date 
for emb engine overhauls related to leased aircraft to be returned  the company adjusts the estimated useful lives of the final engine overhauls based on the respective lease return dates 
effective august   the company and ge engine services  inc ge executed a sixteen year engine services agreement the services agreement covering the scheduled and unscheduled repair of crj engines 
under the terms of the services agreement  the company agreed to pay ge a fixed rate per engine hour  payable monthly  and ge assumed the responsibility to overhaul the company s crj engines as required during the term of the services agreement  subject to certain exclusions 
the company accounted for all crj engine overhaul costs through december  under the accrual method using an estimated hourly accrual rate through august   and then for the period from august  through december  using the fixed rate per engine hour pursuant to the services agreement 
in response to changing market conditions  the company and one of its major partners agreed to modify the method of reimbursement for crj engine overhaul costs under their contract flying arrangement beginning in from reimbursement based on contract flights to reimbursement based on actual engine overhaul costs at the maintenance event 
in april  the company and ge signed a letter agreement the letter agreement amending the services agreement in response to the change with the company s major partner 
pursuant to the letter agreement  payments under the services agreement were modified from the per engine hour basis  payable monthly  to a time and materials basis  payable at the maintenance event 
the revised payment schedule extended through december   at which time monthly payments were to resume on the fixed rate per engine hour  as adjusted for the difference in the actual payments made under the letter agreement during as compared to the payments that would have been made under the services agreement during as discussed below  on march   the services agreement was further amended 
due to the change in the company s contractual arrangement with one of its major partners and based on the letter agreement  the company elected to change from the accrual method to the direct expense method for crj engine overhaul costs effective january  the company believes the direct expense method is preferable in the circumstances because the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed  the direct expense method eliminates significant estimates and judgments inherent under the accrual method  and it is the predominant method used in the airline industry 
accordingly  effective january   the company reversed its engine overhaul accrual that totaled  by recording a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of  net of income taxes of 
the following table summarizes the pro forma impact as if the change in accounting principle was made retroactively to january  in thousands historical pro forma year ended december  operating expenses   operating income   net income   net income per common share basic diluted the letter agreement did not relieve the company from the fixed rate per engine hour obligation under the services agreement and  therefore  a maintenance contract liability to ge of million based on the fixed rate per engine hour  was recorded in the accompanying december  balance sheet with a corresponding deferred maintenance asset of million 
the deferred maintenance asset was recorded since under the expense method the company does not record maintenance expense until the actual maintenance event occurs 
on december   the company and ge agreed to further modify the services agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of a memorandum of understanding the mou 
the mou stipulated that the company would pay for services performed by ge at a rate based upon time and materials as opposed to the fixed rate per engine hour as stipulated in the services agreement and as modified for in the letter agreement 
further  the mou provides that payments made by the company for services completed since the effective date of the services agreement august  shall be considered to be in satisfaction of all amounts owed by the company for work performed under the services agreement as of december  on march   the company and ge amended the services agreement in accordance with the terms outlined in the mou and eliminated the contract liability of recorded in the accompanying december  balance sheet along with the corresponding deferred maintenance asset of million 
aircraft leases the majority of the company s aircraft are leased from third parties 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  the company must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
substantially all of the company s aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
impairment of long lived assets as of december   the company had million of flight equipment and related long lived assets  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
in addition to the original cost of these assets  their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy elections made by the company  including estimated useful lives and salvage values 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment upon certain triggering events  such as a reduction to fleet lives  at each balance sheet date that may indicate the book value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company uses an estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or group of assets over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
the company records an impairment charge if the net book value of the assets being assessed exceeds future undiscounted net cash flows of such assets and the net book value of such assets exceed their fair value 
the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent of other groups of assets 
during  the company recorded a million write off of unamortized engine overhauls as a result of united reducing its flight schedule after the september  terrorist attacks 
results of operations compared to net income 
net income decreased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  factors relating to the change in net income are discussed below 
passenger revenues 
passenger revenues  which represented of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december   increased to million for the year ended december   from million or of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a increase in asms  principally as a result of the delivery of additional crjs during the year  however  this increase was partially offset by the decrease in the fee per departure rates the company is receiving from its major partners eleven additional crjs were placed in service under the delta connection operations and additional crjs were placed in service under the united express operations 
due to lease expirations  the company returned three crjs to the original lessor during passenger revenues were also positively affected by the company s achievement of a controllable completion factor and an actual completion factor of of scheduled flights 
revenue per asm decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in asms produced by crjs resulting in lower revenue per asm pursuant to the terms of the company s agreements with delta and united 
passenger load factor 
passenger load factor increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in load factor was due primarily to the further development of relationships with united and delta whereby skywest is experiencing higher than average load factors as the company adds crjs in its new markets 
the increase was also due  in part  to refinements in flight schedules made by the company s major partners 
total airline expenses excluding fuel 
total airline expenses for the year ended december   excluding fuel charges which are reimbursable by the company s major partners  increased approximately from the same period of the increase was primarily a result of a increase in asms which resulted principally from the expansion of skywest s crj fleet year over year 
total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased at a lower rate than asms 
the primary reason for the lower rate of increase was the increased stage lengths flown by the crjs and the aggressive cost reduction initiatives implemented by the company during the year ended december  operating and interest expense 
operating expenses and interest increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in total operating expenses and interest was due principally to the growth in skywest s crj fleet year over year 
as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues  total operating expenses and interest increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses and interest as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues was primarily due to the reduction in the company s departure rates as operating revenues increased year over year  while total operating expenses and interest increased year over year 
the increase in interest expense was also primarily due to the increase in debt financing of the company s new crjs 
airline operating and interest expense per asm decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the increased capacity of crjs  which are less expensive to operate on a per asm basis than embs 
the following tables set forth information regarding the company s operating and interest expense components for the year ended december  and operating expenses are expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
individual expense components are also expressed as cents per asm

the average number of full time equivalent employees decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the cost per asm for aircraft costs  including aircraft rent and depreciation  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in costs per asm was primarily due to the increase in the number of crjs that were added to skywest s fleet during year ended december   resulting in an increase in stage lengths year over year 
the cost per asm for maintenance expense decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily attributable to the increase in stage lengths flown by crjs  a higher mix of new aircraft within skywest s fleet and the favorable timing of certain maintenance related events 
under the united express agreement  specific amounts are included in the rates and charges for mature maintenance on the company s crj engines that the company records as revenue 
however  the company records maintenance expense on its crj engines as the maintenance expense is incurred 
as a result  during the year ended december   the company collected and recorded as revenue  approximately million pretax under the united express agreement  with no corresponding offset for regional jet engine maintenance overhauls since none were incurred during the year 
the cost per asm for fuel increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this was primarily due to the average price of fuel increasing per gallon  to during from during pursuant to the terms of the company s agreements with its major partners  substantially all fuel costs are reimbursed by the company s major partners 
the cost per asm for other expenses  primarily consisting of landing fees  station rentals  computer reservation system fees and hull and liability insurance  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily due to the increase in stage lengths flown by crjs  the company taking advantage of a government program related to war risk liability and hull insurance coverage whereby the company s liability insurance premiums decreased substantially  the decision of united to discontinue their prior practice of billing the company for access to united s computer reservation system 
the emergency war time supplemental appropriations act of became effective on may   and the company received approximately million under the act 
this legislation provides for compensation to domestic airlines based on their proportional share of passenger security and infrastructure security fees paid  as well as reimbursement for installing fortified flight deck doors 
this new legislation also provides the suspension of passenger and infrastructure fees from june  through december  and an extension of war risk liability and hull insurance coverage through august during the year ended december   the company did not record the benefits of amounts received  as the company anticipates that a significant portion of the payments received by the company will be payable to its major partners pursuant to the terms of the company s agreements with those partners 
these amounts have been recorded as other current liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  interest expense increased to approximately million during the year ended december   from approximately million during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to additional long term debt financing of million related to the crjs acquired by the company during the year ended december  compared to net income 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the million of net income for the year ended december  reflects previously disclosed adjustments to certain revenue and expense items related to changes in the company s maintenance policy 
factors relating to the change in net income are discussed below

the average number of full time equivalent employees increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in number of employees was due in large part  to the addition of personnel required for skywest s current and anticipated expansion 
the cost per asm for aircraft costs  including aircraft rent and depreciation  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily due to the increase in the number of crjs that were added to the fleet during the twelve months ended december   resulting in an increase in stage lengths year over year 
the cost per asm for maintenance expense decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily due to the greater stage lengths flown by the crjs  a higher mix of new aircraft within the fleet and the favorable timing of certain maintenance related events 
under the company s united express agreement  specific amounts are included in the rates and charges for mature maintenance on its crj engines as it incurred 
as a result  during the year ended december   the company collected and recorded as revenue  approximately million pretax under the united express agreement  with no corresponding offset for regional jet engine maintenance overhauls since none were incurred 
the cost per asm for fuel decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the average price of fuel decreasing per gallon  to as of december   from as of december  pursuant to the terms of the company s agreements with its major partners  substantially all fuel costs are reimbursed by the company s major partners 
the cost per asm of other expenses  primarily consisting of commissions  landing fees  station rentals  computer reservation system fees and hull and liability insurance decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost per asm was primarily due to the increase in the number of crjs that have been added to skywest s fleet and the company taking advantage of a government program related to war risk liability and hull insurance coverage whereby the company s liability insurance premiums decreased substantially 
interest expense increased to approximately million during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was due primarily to the decrease in the amount of interest available for capitalization in all interest expense was capitalized during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of million and a current ratio of at december   compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  the principal sources of funds during the year ended december  were million of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  million provided by operating activities  million in proceeds from the sale lease back of crjs and million from the sale of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options under the company s stock option plans and the company s employee stock purchase plan 
during the year ended december   the company invested million in flight equipment  million in marketable securities  million in other assets and million in buildings and ground equipment 
the company made principal payments on long term debt of million and paid million in cash dividends 
these factors resulted in a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  the company s position in marketable securities  consisting primarily of bonds  bond funds and commercial paper  increased to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in marketable securities was due primarily to the company s successful completion of aircraft financing transactions wherein the company entered into long term  third party  us leveraged lease transactions or long term debt transactions and reduced its net investment in previous aircraft acquisitions 
at december   the company s total capital mix was equity and debt  compared to equity and debt at december  the change in the total capital mix during reflected the company s incurrence of approximately million of debt financing related to crjs acquired by the company during the financing agreements associated with the new crjs permit the company to refinance the debt into long term lease agreements with third party lessors 
accordingly the interim financing has been classified as long term debt in the accompanying financial statements 
the company expended approximately million for aircraft related capital expenditures during the year ended december  these expenditures consisted primarily of million for rotable spares  million for engine overhauls  million for aircraft improvements  and million for buildings  ground equipment and other assets 
the company has available million in an unsecured bank line of credit through january   with interest payable at the bank s base rate less one quarter percent  which was a net rate of at december  the company believes that in the absence of unusual circumstances  the working capital available to the company will be sufficient to meet its present requirements  including expansion  capital expenditures  lease payments and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
during the fourth quarter of  the company classified million of cash as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets as required by the company s workers compensation policy

on september   the company announced the completion of a firm order for  seat crjs for its united express operations 
the company presently anticipates that it will begin taking delivery of these aircraft in january and continue through may the company s firm aircraft orders  as of december   consisted of orders for  seat crjs scheduled for delivery through may gross committed expenditures for these aircraft and related equipment  including estimated amounts for contractual price escalations will be approximately million through and million through the contract also includes options for another aircraft that can be delivered in either or seat configurations 
the company presently anticipates that delivery dates for these aircraft could start in june and continue through september  however  actual delivery dates remain subject to final determination as agreed upon by the company and united 
the company has significant long term lease obligations primarily relating to its aircraft fleet 
these leases are classified as operating leases and therefore are not reflected as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
although some of the company s aircraft lease arrangements are variable interest entities as defined by fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  management believes none require consolidation in the company s financial statements 
the lease agreements do not contain any guarantees of the debt underlying the lease or fixed price purchase options or residual value guarantees 
at december   the company has aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from one to years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at december  at a discount factor  the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately billion at december  as part of the company s leveraged lease agreements  the company typically agrees to indemnify the equity owner participant against liabilities that may arise due to changes in benefits from tax ownership of the respective leased aircraft 
the company s total long term debt at december  was million  of which million related to the acquisition of emb and crj aircraft and million related to the construction of the company s new corporate office building 
certain amounts related to the embs are supported by continuing subsidy payments through the export support program of the federative republic of brazil 
the subsidy payments reduced the stated interest rates to an average effective rate of approximately on million of the company s long term debt at december  the continuing subsidy payments are at risk to the company if the federative republic of brazil does not meet its obligations under the export support program 
while the company has no reason to believe  based on information currently available  that the company will not continue to receive these subsidy payments from the federative republic of brazil in the future  there can be no assurance that such a default will not occur 
on the remaining long term debt related to the emb aircraft of million  the lender has assumed the risk of the subsidy payments and the average effective rate on this debt was approximately at december  the average effective rate on the debt related to the crj aircraft of million was at december   and is not subject to subsidy payments 
off balance sheet arrangements the company typically enters into third party long term operating leases with regards to aircraft purchases 
as a result  these long term leases are not included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
these obligations are summarized in the table set forth in the preceding section of this report entitled significant commitments and obligations and described in further detail in that section 
seasonality the company s results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year  since the airline industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations and general economic conditions 
skywest s operations are somewhat favorably affected by increased travel on its prorate routes  historically occurring in the summer months  and are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from november through january and by inclement weather which occasionally results in cancelled flights  principally during the winter months 
new accounting standard in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities 
it is management s belief that the majority of the company s leased aircraft is owned and leased through trusts whose sole purpose is to purchase  finance and lease these aircraft to the company  therefore  they meet the criteria of a variable interest entity 
however  since these are single owner trusts in which the company does not participate  the company is not at risk for losses and is not considered the primary beneficiary 
as a result  based on the current rules  the company is not required to consolidate any of these lessors or any other entities in applying fin management believes that the company s maximum exposure under these leases is the remaining lease payments  which are reflected in the future minimum lease payments table in note to the company s consolidated financial statements as of december  as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements as of december   the company entered into an agreement with united on september   whereby the company is reimbursed based on block hours  departures and certain pass through costs  plus an amount per aircraft 
this arrangement is designed to reimburse the company for certain aircraft ownership costs 
in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease eitf  the company has concluded that a component of its revenue under the agreement discussed above is rental income  inasmuch as the united agreement identifies the right of use of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period of time 
the amount deemed to be rental income during the year since the date of inception of the new agreement was million and has been included in passenger revenue on the company s statements of income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aircraft fuel in the past  the company has not experienced difficulties with fuel availability and expects to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet its future needs 
effective january   the company s contracts with its major partners obligate its major partners to bear the majority of the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations 
as such  during the terms of those contracts the company anticipates that its results from operations will not be directly affected by fuel price volatility 
interest rates the company s financial condition and results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates due to the amounts of variable rate long term debt and the amount of cash and securities held 
the interest rates applicable to variable rate notes may rise and increase the amount of interest expense 
however  the company would also receive higher amounts of interest income on its cash and securities held at the time 
at december   the company had variable rate notes representing of its total long term debt compared with of its total long term debt at december  for illustrative purposes only  the impact of market risk is estimated using a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point for both the company s variable rate long term debt and cash and securities 
based on this hypothetical assumption  the company would have incurred an additional  in interest expense and received  in additional interest income for the year ended december   and an additional  in interest expense and received  in additional interest income for the year ended december
