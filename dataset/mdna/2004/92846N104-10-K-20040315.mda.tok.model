item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
market acceptance the company s success depends on its ability to successfully market its vitrea software for clinical use  and on the ability and willingness of physicians to use d  d and d medical imaging software in disease screening  clinical diagnosis and therapy planning 
the three dimensional medical imaging software offered by vitrea represents a new alternative to the conventional methods traditionally used for viewing medical images in the clinical setting 
the acceptance of vitrea by physicians and other clinicians will depend on the company s ability to educate those users as to the speed  ease of use and other benefits offered by the vitrea system  as well as the company s timely introduction of new features and functions 
there can be no assurance that users will prefer three dimensional medical imaging software over less expensive two dimensional medical imaging software or that the company will succeed in its efforts to further develop  commercialize  and achieve market acceptance for its vitrea product or for any other product in the clinical setting 
see business technology  industry background  markets and competition 
substantial reliance on a single product revenue from sales of the vitrea system constituted of the company s total revenue for the year ended december   of the company s total revenue for the year ended december   and of the company s total revenue for the year ended december  the company anticipates that revenue from the sale of vitrea will continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenue for the foreseeable future 
as such  the failure of physicians to accept vitrea would have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on market growth the d medical imaging industry in which the company markets its products is still developing due to the fairly recent availability of high performance computers at reduced prices  the recent adoption of industry standards for the generation  transmission and storage of medical imaging data  and changing medical practices 
historically  there has been a perception that three dimensional imaging was too slow or difficult for clinical use 
this perception was due largely to the relatively slower processing speed of workstations available in the past 
the company believes that the recent advances in the affordability of high performance computers and in the development of industry standards for the generation  transmission  and storage of imaging data will provide opportunities for growth in the d medical imaging industry 
however  given the uncertainties associated with the developing stage of this industry  there can be no assurance that it will continue to develop in the manner anticipated by the company 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the d medical imaging industry will provide growth opportunities for the company and its software products or that the company s business strategies will be successful as the d medical imaging industry continues to evolve 
ultimately  if the d medical imaging industry fails to develop as the company expects  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
highly competitive industry the company faces intense competition in the d medical imaging industry 
the company expects technology to continue to develop rapidly  and the company s success will depend to a large extent on its ability to maintain a competitive position with its products 
the company s competitors in the d medical imaging industry include large  established manufacturers of ct and mr imaging equipment 
companies such as ge medical systems  siemens medical systems  inc and philips medical systems typically offer their own medical imaging software and workstations as part of their integrated imaging and scanner systems 
the company s ability to successfully market and sell its current d medical imaging products to prospective customers depends  in part  on its ability to persuade such customers to separate the purchase of ct or mr equipment from the selection and purchase of d medical imaging workstations 
in addition to having significantly greater capital and staffing resources for research and development that are critical to success in the rapidly changing d medical imaging industry  such companies also have well established marketing and distribution networks and have a competitive advantage in marketing d medical imaging tools as an integrated part of their imaging products 
while price has been less significant than other factors  increasing competition may result in price reductions and reduced gross margins 
additionally  the company faces competition from other entities  such as software suppliers and pacs vendors 
the company may not be able to compete effectively with such manufacturers or competing entities 
see business technology  industry background and competition 
risk of technological obsolescence the d medical imaging market is characterized by rapid innovation and technological change 
the company may be unable to compete effectively in the marketplace  and products developed by its competitors may render its products obsolete or non competitive 
similarly  the company s competitors may succeed in developing or marketing products that are viewed as providing superior clinical performance or are less expensive than the company s current or future products 
dependence on major customers one of the company s principal distribution channels is to sell its vitrea medical imaging software for inclusion with the delivery of medical imaging equipment being sold by toshiba 
sales by the company to toshiba accounted for approximately  and of the company s total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
toshiba s account receivable represented of the company s accounts receivable at december  and at december  management believes a limited number of large customers may continue to account for a significant portion of the company s revenue during any given period for the foreseeable future 
except for its marketing and distribution agreements with toshiba  medtronic snt  e z em  inc and mckesson  the company currently has no long term purchase or other agreements with any of its customers  and it generally makes sales pursuant to purchase orders 
a reduction  delay  or cancellation of orders from one or more of its significant customers  or its inability to collect accounts receivable from these customers  likely would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
see business marketing and distribution 
impact of purchase commitments in november  the company entered into an agreement with r to distribute r s lung nodule cad software product in conjunction with the company s products 
during the three year period beginning with the later of either the date r is able to meet ce certification requirements and produce a declaration of conformance for the lung cad product or the completion of milestones in the development plan for the lung cad product that will be distributed in europe  the company is required to begin purchasing the lung cad product from r r met ce certification requirements and produced a declaration of conformance for the lung cad product in  and the company completed the milestones in the development plan in january with respect to the lung cad product that will be distributed in europe 
accordingly  the company will be required to begin purchasing the lung cad product in the first half of the total purchase commitment will be a maximum of million of product over the three year commitment period 
the purchase commitment price the company has to pay will be reduced if the selling price of the lung cad product when sold directly to end users by r falls below a specified price 
the purchase commitment units the company is required to purchase will be reduced if r and its other distributors of the lung cad product are unable to sell as many units as the company is required to purchase 
however  the company must purchase the minimum amount under the agreement with r regardless of how much of the lung cad product it sells 
if the cost of the lung cad product the company buys is greater than the price of the lung cad product it sells  or if the company is unable to sell some or all of the lung cad product it buys  its business could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in operating results the company may experience significant fluctuations in future annual and quarterly operating results 
if these fluctuations occur  they may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors that are outside of our control including  but not limited to  the timing of significant orders  the timing of product enhancements and new product introductions by the company or its competitors  the pricing of the company s products  changes in customers budgets  and competitive conditions 
government regulation the company s products are subject to regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the development  introduction  manufacturing  labeling and record keeping procedures for medical devices  including d medical imaging software and systems 
the process of obtaining marketing clearance from the fda for new products and new applications for existing products can be time consuming and expensive 
all of the current products actively marketed by the company have received marketing clearance from the fda pursuant to k pre market notifications 
vitrea and the company s add on options have been cleared to be marketed for use with ct and mr scanners 
the fda may not grant clearance with respect to the company s future products or enhancements  or future fda review may involve delays that could adversely affect the company s ability to market such future products or enhancements 
in addition  the company s future products or enhancements may be subject to the more lengthy and expensive pre market approval process with the fda 
even if the company obtains regulatory clearances and approvals to market a product from the fda  these approvals may entail limitations on the indicated uses of the product 
product clearances and approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
the fda could also limit or prevent the distribution of the company s products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation  and future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies may adversely affect the company 
the fda may inspect the company and its facilities from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with various regulations relating to specification  development  documentation  validation  testing  quality control and product labeling 
if the fda determines that the company is in violation of such regulations  it could impose civil penalties  including fines  recall or seize products and  in extreme cases  impose criminal sanctions 
the company markets its products both domestically and internationally 
international regulatory bodies have established varying regulations governing product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
the inability or failure of the company to comply with the varying regulations  or the imposition of new regulations  could restrict its ability to sell its products internationally and could adversely affect the company s business

health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa the hipaa regulations are causing the company s customers to request that the company sign business associate agreements with them 
a business associate is a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of  or that provides services to  a covered entity 
by law  the hipaa privacy rule applies only to covered entities health plans  health care clearinghouses  and certain health care providers 
however  most health care providers do not carry out all of their health care activities and functions by themselves 
instead  they often use the services of a variety of other persons or businesses 
the privacy rule allows covered providers and health plans to disclose protected health information to these business associates if the providers or plans obtain satisfactory assurances that the business associate will use the information only for the purposes for which it was engaged by the covered entity  will safeguard the information from misuse  and will help the covered entity comply with some of the covered entity s duties under the privacy rule 
covered entities may disclose protected health information to an entity in its role as a business associate only to help the covered entity carry out its health care functions not for the business associate s independent use or purposes  except as needed for the proper management and administration of the business associate 
if the company is not willing to or is unable to enter into a business associate agreement with current and potential customers  such customers may not purchase products or services from the company  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
uncertain protection for intellectual property  possible claims of others although the company has filed patent applications with respect to certain aspects of its technology  it generally does not rely on patent protection with respect to its products and technologies 
instead  the company relies primarily on a combination of trade secret and copyright law  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect intellectual property rights pertaining to its products and technologies 
such measures may not provide meaningful protection of the company s trade secrets  know how or other intellectual property in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure 
others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by the company 
in addition  to the extent that the company applies for any patents  such applications may not result in issued patents or  if issued  such patents may not be valid or of value 
the company does not believe that its products and technologies infringe any existing patents or intellectual property rights of third parties 
however  the company s products and technologies may infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of third parties 
the costs of prosecuting or defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could adversely affect the company s business  even if it was ultimately successful in prosecuting or defending any such claims 
if the company s products or technologies were found to infringe the rights of a third party  the company could be required to pay significant damages or license fees or cease production  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business

product liability risk  limited insurance coverage the manufacture and sale of products used in the practice of medicine entail significant risk of product liability claims 
the company currently maintains product liability insurance in the amount of  per occurrence and  in total and errors and omissions coverage in the amount of  per occurrence and in total 
however  the company s coverage limits may not be adequate to protect the company from any liabilities it might incur in connection with the sale of its products 
further  the company may not be able to maintain this level of coverage in the future 
the company also may need increased product liability coverage as it releases additional products and updates 
such insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or series of such claims against the company in excess of the company s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on its business 
need to hire additional personnel the company s ability to enhance and develop markets for its current products and to introduce new products to the marketplace also depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and management personnel 
the company competes for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and organizations  many of which have substantially greater capital resources  name recognition  and research and development capabilities than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in recruiting or retaining such personnel 
the company may not be able to recruit and retain such personnel  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
management of growth the company s ability to grow successfully requires an effective planning and management process 
the expansion and growth of its business could place a significant strain on the company s management systems  infrastructure and other resources 
to manage its growth successfully  the company must continue to improve and expand its systems and infrastructure in a timely and efficient manner 
in addition  the success of any acquisition  including the company s acquisition of hinnovation  will depend on the company s ability to successfully integrate the acquired business with the company s business 
the company s controls  systems  procedures and resources may not be adequate to support a changing and growing company 
if the company s management fails to respond effectively to changes and growth in its business  including acquisitions  such failure could have a material adverse effect on its business 
dependence on third party reimbursement the company s products are purchased by hospitals  clinics  imaging centers and other users  which bill various third party payers  such as government health programs  private health insurance plans  managed care organizations and other similar programs  for the health care goods and services provided to their patients 
there are currently current procedural terminology cpt reimbursement codes for most of the diagnostic procedures that use the company s products 
however  the amount of such reimbursement varies by location and is subject to change 
payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a product used in a procedure was not used in accordance with established payer protocol regarding cost effective treatment methods or was used for an unapproved indication 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical services and  in some instances  have put pressure on service providers to lower their prices or reduce their services 
the company is unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by third party healthcare payers 
the procedures in which the company s products are used may not be considered cost effective by third party payers 
reimbursement for such procedures may not be available or  if available  payers low reimbursement levels may adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
in addition  there have been and may continue to be proposals by legislators  regulators and third party payers to curb further these costs in the future 
a failure by hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain reimbursement from third party payers  changes in third party payers policies toward reimbursement for procedures using the company s products or legislative action could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
see business third party reimbursement and cost containment 
uncertainty of health care reform the levels of revenue and profitability of medical technology companies may be affected by the efforts of government and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
in the united states  there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  a number of federal  state  and private proposals to control health care costs 
these proposals may contain measures intended to control public and private spending on health care as well as to provide universal public access to the health care system 
if enacted  these proposals may result in a substantial restructuring of the health care delivery system 
significant changes in the nation s health care system could have a substantial impact on the manner in which the company conducts its business and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
possible issuances of preferred stock the company s articles of incorporation authorize its board of directors  without any action by its shareholders  to establish the rights and preferences of up to  shares of currently undesignated preferred stock 
these shares of preferred stock could possess voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock and may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
no shares of preferred stock or other senior equity securities are currently designated  and currently the company has no plan to designate or issue any such securities 
anti takeover considerations the company is subject to anti takeover provisions of the minnesota business corporation act 
in addition  the company has adopted a shareholder rights plan the rights agreement designed to protect the company and its shareholders from unsolicited attempts to acquire the company 
these measures may deter or discourage takeover attempts and other changes in control of the company that are not approved by its board of directors  and they may have a depressive effect on any market for the company s stock 
as a result  the company s shareholders may lose opportunities to dispose of their shares at the higher prices typically available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal 
in addition  these measures may have the effect of permitting the company s current directors to retain their positions and place them in a better position to resist changes that the company s shareholders may wish to make if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of the company s business 
no dividends the company has not paid cash dividends on its common stock in the past  and it does not intend to do so in the foreseeable future 
limitations on director liability as permitted by minnesota law  the company s articles of incorporation provide that directors of the company shall not be personally liable to the company or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director  with certain exceptions 
these provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by shareholders on behalf of the company against a director 
in addition  the company s bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by minnesota law 
item properties the company s principal office is located in plymouth  minnesota  where the company currently occupies approximately  square feet under a lease that expires july   with the exception of a small portion of the space that is under lease until may under certain conditions contained in the lease  the company has the option to expand its facilities 
the company considers its current facilities adequate for its current needs and believes that suitable additional space will be available as and if needed

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following represents those critical accounting policies and estimates where materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects the company s estimate of losses that may result from the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an analysis of individual accounts for which the company has information indicating the customer may not be able to pay amounts owed to the company 
in these cases  based on the available facts and circumstances  the company estimates the amount that will be collected from such customers 
the company also evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable in the aggregate based on factors such as the aging of receivable amounts  customer concentrations  historical experience  and current economic trends and conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted when additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
if circumstances change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced or increased by a material amount 
such a change in estimated recoverability would be accounted for in the period in which the facts that give rise to the change become known 
as of december   the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of  deferred tax asset 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
during  the company concluded that it is more likely than not that substantially all of its net deferred tax assets would be realized and the company reversed substantially all of its valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets  which resulted in the recording of a net tax benefit in the reversal of the deferred tax assets valuation allowance is based upon the company s historical operating performance and management s expectation that the company will generate taxable income of at least million in future periods to allow it to realize its deferred tax assets resulting from the tax benefits associated with its net operating loss carryforwards and a significant portion of its research and development tax credit carryforwards  as well as certain other tax benefits related to book and tax income timing differences 
the company recorded a net increase in deferred tax assets of million  million of which was recorded as a tax benefit in the statement of operations and represents the tax benefit of its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  as well as certain other tax benefits related to book and tax income timing differences 
the remaining million increase in deferred tax assets was recorded as additional paid in capital and represents the amount of deferred tax assets generated from the exercise of stock options 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
long lived assets 
the company periodically reviews the carrying amounts of property and equipment and intangible assets purchased in the normal course of business to determine whether current events or circumstances  as defined in statement of financial accounting standard no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  warrant adjustments to such carrying amounts 
in reviewing the carrying values of property and equipment and intangible assets purchased in the normal course of business  the company considers  among other things  the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset 
to the extent these future estimated undiscounted cash flows significantly change  an impairment could be identified 
revenue recognition 
the company licenses its software and sells products and services to end users and also indirectly through oems and independent distributors 
terms offered by the company do not generally differ based on whether the customer is an end user  oem or independent distributor 
the company offers terms that require payment within to days after product delivery 
the company does not offer rights of return  acceptance clauses or price protection to its customers 
license fees revenue is derived from the licensing of computer software 
hardware revenue is derived from the sale of system hardware  including peripheral equipment 
maintenance and service revenue is derived from hardware and software maintenance and from services consisting of telephone support  installation  training and engineering services 
the company s software licenses are always sold as part of an arrangement that includes maintenance and support and often installation and training services 
engineering services consist of software modification or development services that are sold separately to oems 
the company generally sells hardware as part of a system sale  but it occasionally sells hardware as part of a system upgrade or additional product sale 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
the company evaluates the credit worthiness of all customers 
in circumstances where the company does not have experience selling to a customer and lacks adequate credit information to conclude collection is probable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fees are collected and all other revenue recognition criteria in the arrangement have been met 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the following are the specific revenue recognition policies for services and multiple element arrangements 
software and hardware revenue from license fees and hardware is recognized when shipment of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation remain and the company s services are not considered essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
see also multiple element arrangements below for further information 
services revenue from maintenance and support arrangements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangements 
revenue from training and installation services is recognized as the services are provided to customers 
revenue from engineering services  where the company is performing significant customization or modification of software  is recognized using contract accounting on a percentage of completion basis 
the company records revenue by reference to actual hours incurred to date and the estimated hours remaining to complete the services 
multiple element arrangements the company enters into arrangements with customers that include a combination of software products  system hardware  specified upgrades  maintenance and support  or installation and training services 
for such arrangements  the company recognizes revenue using the residual value method 
the company allocates the total arrangement fee among each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each of the undelivered elements determined based on vendor specific objective evidence 
the fair value of maintenance and support services is based upon the renewal rate for continued service arrangements 
the fair value of installation and training services is established based upon separate pricing for the services 
in software arrangements for which the company does not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when vendor specific objective evidence is determined for the undelivered elements residual method or when all elements have been delivered

license fee revenue increased to  in and increased to  in from  in the increase in software license fee revenue was driven by an increase in the number of vitrea licenses sold  principally to toshiba medical systems corporation toshiba  and an increase in the number of vitrea add on options sold 
the installed base of vitrea customers increased from approximately at december  to approximately at december  to approximately  at december  the number of vitrea add on modules sold by the company increased from approximately in  to in and  in for  the company generated revenue growth from the sale of vitrea options  including vscore  ct colonography  automated vessel measurements and ct cardiac 
the sale of vitrea options totaled  for compared with  in and  in for  software license fee revenue from sales to toshiba totaled  compared with  for and  for maintenance and services revenue increased to  for compared to  for and increased to  in from  in of the  increase for compared to   consisted of an increase in maintenance revenue and  was an increase in training revenue 
the increases for were partially offset by an  decrease in engineering services rendered under product development agreements with medtronic surgical navigation technologies snt  e z em  inc and toshiba and a  decrease in installation revenue due to toshiba performing its own installations of vitrea of the  increase for compared to   consisted of an increase in maintenance revenue and  was an increase in training revenue 
the increases in maintenance revenue in both and were due to the company adding new customers to the installed base and renewing back maintenance from customers whose maintenance arrangements had lapsed 
the increases in training revenue in both and were due to an overall increase in the number of training sessions sold with the customers initial purchases of software 
hardware revenue decreased to  in from  in and increased to  in from  in the decrease in hardware revenue from to was due to a decrease in the number of complete system sales and lower unit pricing for hardware platforms shipped in although total revenue grew from to  hardware revenue grew only due to a change in the sales model with toshiba 
prior to the third quarter of  all of the company s sales to toshiba were complete systems sales 
beginning in the third quarter of and continuing thereafter  most of the revenue resulting from sales to toshiba was derived from software only sales  which resulted in a decrease in hardware revenue 
gross margin the company s gross margin percentage was in  up from in the gross margin percentage was in revenue in included more higher margin software license fee revenue and less lower margin hardware revenue than in in addition  there was a increase in maintenance and services revenue with only a increase in cost of revenue for maintenance and services 
the number of customer support employees increased from at december  to at december  the decrease in margin in compared to was due to increasing costs for customer support resulting from the company s growth  which was partially offset by the favorable impact of sales mix 
revenue in included more of higher margin software license fee revenue than in the number of customer support employees increased from at december  to at december  the vitrea system  consisting of vitrea software and third party hardware and peripherals  is designed to offer end users an integrated d medical imaging system 
the company receives a nominal discount in purchasing the third party hardware and peripheral components of the vitrea system  and the company s gross margin on the resale of these system components approximates its discount 
during  the company will begin selling more third party software products  including lung visualization products from r technology  inc r and a fusion technology product from mirada solutions  limited 
the company will receive a discount when purchasing these third party software products  but such discounts will be considerably less than the gross margins the company earns on its own internally developed software products 
accordingly  the company anticipates that its gross margin on software license fee revenue  as well as the overall gross margin for total revenue  will decrease in future periods 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were   and  for  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and it does not enter into forward financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates because  as disclosed above  substantially all of the company s foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
based on the controls in place and the relative size of the financial instruments entered into  the company believes the risks associated with not using these instruments would not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition  the company does not engage in speculative transactions and does not use derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
see the notes to financial statements for a description of the company s accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates and price changes that could affect the company s operating results 
as of december   fluctuations in interest rates  exchange rates and price changes would not have a material effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
interest rate risk the company places its cash and cash equivalents  which generally have a term of less than days  with a high quality financial institution and has investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents investments totaling  due to the short term nature of these instruments  the carrying value approximates market value 
if  during  average short term interest rates decreased by over average rates  the company s projected interest income from short term investments would decrease by approximately  assuming a similar level of investments in price risk as of december   the company held marketable securities with an aggregate fair market value of  all of the company s marketable securities are classified as available for sale and all mature in one year or less 
available for sale investments are recorded at market value  which is based on quoted market prices  with unrealized holding gains and losses included as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the company uses a specific identification cost method to determine the gross realized gains and losses on the sale of its securities 
had market prices of such securities declined as of december   the values of these instruments would have decreased by  foreign currency risk substantially all of the company s foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
therefore  fluctuations in the value of the dollar as compared to other foreign currencies have not had an effect on the company
