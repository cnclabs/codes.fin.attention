overview we are a self managed  self administered  fully integrated real estate investment trust reit that is engaged in the ownership  development  acquisition  leasing  management and operation of regional shopping malls and community centers 
our shopping center properties are located primarily in the southeast and midwest  as well as in select markets in other regions of the united states 
as of december   we owned controlling interests in regional malls  associated centers each adjacent to a regional shopping mall  community centers  and our corporate office building 
we consolidate the financial statements of all entities in which we have a controlling financial interest 
as of december   we owned non controlling interests in four regional malls  two associated centers and community centers 
because major decisions such as the acquisition  sale or refinancing of principal partnership or joint venture assets must be approved by one or more of the other partners  we do not control these partnerships and joint ventures and  accordingly  account for these investments using the equity method 
we had two malls  both owned in joint ventures  three mall expansions  one associated center  two community centers and one community center expansion under construction as of december  the majority of our revenues are derived from leases with retail tenants and generally include base minimum rents  percentage rents based on tenants sales volumes and reimbursements from tenants for expenditures  including property operating expenses  real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs  as well as certain capital expenditures 
we also generate revenues from sales of outparcel land at the properties and from sales of operating real estate assets when it is determined that we can realize the maximum value of the assets 
proceeds from such sales are generally used to reduce borrowings on the credit facilities 
our regional mall portfolio performed well during as evidenced by consistently high occupancy levels  increased rents on expiring leases  and growth in both specialty leasing income and same store mall store sales 
the properties we acquired over the past two years also made significant contributions to our growth in as we continued to leverage our expertise to improve the tenant mix in these properties and to capitalize on opportunities for specialty leasing income 
we expanded our portfolio with the acquisition of six malls and two associated centers during  representing a total investment of million 
the acquisition market is competitive and we continue to pursue potential acquisition opportunities where we believe that we can leverage our expertise to enhance the value of the property 
during  we obtained a new secured credit facility and capitalized on the favorable interest rate environment by obtaining non recourse  fixed rate mortgage loans on several of our properties 
we also made a strategic decision to contribute ownership interests in of our community centers to galileo america llc galileo america  a joint venture we have formed with australia based galileo america shopping trust 
galileo america shopping trust has a controlling interest in the joint venture and we have a noncontrolling interest 
while this transaction will result in a short term dilution to earnings  we believe it allows us to develop and acquire real estate assets that will be more productive in the long term and provides us access to a new capital market 
on october   we completed the first phase of the transaction when we sold interests in community centers to galileo america 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the results of operations of these properties have not been reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements since we have significant continuing involvement with the properties through our ownership interest in galileo america and the long term agreement under which we will be the exclusive manager of the properties 
bankruptcy filings and store closings by retail tenants are normal in the course of our business 
our leasing personnel continually work to re lease spaces that become vacant due to bankruptcies  store closings and lease expirations 
during  bankruptcies resulted in store closings  representing million in annual gross rentals 
subsequent to year end  kb toys  gadzooks  one price clothing  and footstar filed for bankruptcy 
the total annual gross rentals related to the stores these retailers have notified us will be closing is million

x the sale of interests in community centers to galileo america in october the galileo transaction 
revenues the million increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increases of million from the new properties  million from the newly consolidated properties and million from properties that were in operation for all of and  offset by a reduction of million from the galileo transaction 
the increase in revenues at properties that were in operation for all of and was primarily driven by our ability to maintain high occupancy levels while achieving increases in rents from both new leases and lease renewals on comparable spaces 
additionally  our cost recovery ratio improved to in compared to in due primarily to the partial recovery of certain capital expenditures incurred in connection with the significant number of mall renovations completed during the past three years 
management  leasing and development fees decreased million because of a reduction in fees related to the newly consolidated properties 
operating expenses property operating expenses including real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs increased million due to increases of million from the new properties and million from the newly consolidated properties  offset by a reduction of million from the galileo transaction 
the million increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from increases of million from the new properties  million from the newly consolidated properties and million from the comparable centers  which is primarily attributable to the property renovations and expansions that were completed during and these increases were offset by a reduction of million from the galileo transaction 
general and administrative expenses increased million because we had a lower level of development activity in than in as a result  we capitalized less in salaries of leasing and development personnel  which resulted in higher compensation expense 
there were also additional salaries and benefits for the personnel added to manage the properties acquired during and combined with normal wage increases for existing personnel 
other income and expenses interest expense increased million due to the debt on the new properties and the newly consolidated properties 
we also refinanced million of short term  variable rate debt with fixed rate  non recourse long term debt with a higher interest rate 
the increase was offset somewhat by a reduction in debt related to the galileo transaction and normal principal amortization 
while converting to fixed rate debt is dilutive in the short term  it is consistent with our strategy of minimizing exposure to variable rate debt when we can obtain fixed rate debt on terms that are deemed favorable for the long term 
the net gain on sales of million in was primarily attributable to the million gain recognized on the galileo transaction 
the remaining million of gain was related to gains on sales of outparcels at various properties and sales of two options on potential development sites 
equity in earnings decreased by million in as a result of the newly consolidated properties no longer being accounted for using the equity method 
six community centers were sold during for a net gain on discontinued operations of million 
operating income from discontinued operations decreased in because the properties were owned for a shorter period of time in than in  and because includes the operations of properties that were sold during comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following significant transactions impacted the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  x the acquisition of ownership interests in malls and two associated centers from the richard e

x during the first quarter of  we began to include columbia place in columbia  sc  in the consolidated financial statements after acquiring an additional interest in the property  which resulted in our owning a controlling interest 
in august  we acquired the remaining interest in columbia place 
our interest in columbia place was previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
x in february  we contributed of our interests in pemberton plaza  an associated center in vicksburg  ms  and massard crossing and willowbrook plaza  community centers located in ft 
smith  ar  and houston  tx  respectively  to a joint venture that is accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
prior to the date of contribution  the results of operations of these properties were included in our consolidated statements of operations 
revenues the million increase in revenues was primarily attributable to x million from an additional month of operations in related to the jacobs properties combined with improvements in leasing and occupancy at the jacobs properties  x million from the additional nine properties opened or acquired during and  x million from both the continued improvement in leasing and occupancy at comparable properties and an increase in lease termination fees of million to million in compared to million in  x an increase of million in management  leasing and development fees as a result of management and leasing fees from unconsolidated affiliates that were acquired in the jacobs transaction and from an unconsolidated affiliate that began operations during x a reduction of million related to the properties sold during and x a reduction of million related to the three properties that were contributed to a joint venture early in operating expenses property operating expenses including real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs increased by million due to x an increase of million related to the additional month in for the jacobs properties  x an increase of million related to the other nine properties opened or acquired during and and x a reduction of million related to both the properties sold during and the three properties contributed to a joint venture in depreciation and amortization expense increased by million due to x an increase of million related to the additional month for the jacobs properties  x an additional million related to the other nine properties opened or acquired during and  x additional depreciation of million related to the capital expenditures made during and in connection with the ongoing renovations at other capital expenditures at existing properties x a reduction of million related to both the properties sold during and the three properties contributed to a joint venture 
general and administrative expenses increased million primarily due to additional salaries and benefits for the personnel added to manage the properties acquired during and increased professional fees and the costs to move to our new corporate headquarters also contributed to the increase 
other income and expenses interest expense decreased million due to reductions of debt with net proceeds of million from the march common stock offering and net proceeds of million from the june preferred stock offering 
the loss on extinguishment of debt decreased from million in to million in because we retired less debt subject to prepayment penalties in as compared to the net gain on sales of real estate assets of million in was related to total gains of million on seven outparcel sales and total losses of million on three outparcel sales 
the net gain on sales of million in includes a net gain on sales of operating properties of million and a net gain of million from sales of nine outparcels 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased because we acquired additional partnership interests in east towne mall  west towne mall and west towne crossing in madison  wi  and kentucky oaks mall in paducah  ky  in march the increase was offset by the effect of accounting for columbia place as a consolidated property in as compared to an unconsolidated affiliate in five community centers and an office building were sold during for a net gain on discontinued operations of million 
the fluctuation between years in operating income from discontinued operations results from the timing of the dispositions during each year 
operational review the shopping center business is  to some extent  seasonal in nature with tenants achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter because of the holiday season 
additionally  the malls earn most of their temporary rents rents from short term tenants  during the holiday period 
thus  occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the fiscal year 
we classify our regional malls into two categories malls that have completed their initial lease up stabilized malls and malls that are in their initial lease up phase non stabilized malls 
non stabilized malls currently include the lakes mall in muskegon  mi  which opened in august  and parkway place in huntsville  al  which opened in october we derive a significant amount of our revenues from the mall properties 
the sources of our revenues by property type were as follows year ended december  malls associated centers community centers mortgages  office building and other sales and occupancy costs mall store sales for those tenants who occupy  square feet or less and have reported sales in the stabilized malls increased by on a comparable per square foot basis to per square foot for compared with per square foot for the increase in represented the first year over year increase in three years  as sales were either flat or down slightly in those years 
occupancy costs as a percentage of sales for the stabilized malls were and for and  respectively 
occupancy the occupancy of the portfolio was as follows year ended december  total portfolio occupancy total mall portfolio stabilized malls non stabilized malls associated centers community centers excludes the community centers that were in the first phase of the galileo transaction the occupancy of the associated centers declined during because of the vacancy of a  square foot just for feet store at the village at rivergate in nashville  tn and a  square foot appliance factory warehouse at hamilton corner in chattanooga  tn 
the continued vacancy of a  square foot former ames store at westmoreland crossing  which was vacant when the center was acquired in december  also had a negative impact on the occupancy of the associated centers 
leasing average annual base rents per square foot were as follows for each property type at december  stabilized malls non stabilized malls associated centers community centers excludes the community centers that were in the first phase of the galileo transaction 
the increase in average base rents resulted from our ability to achieve positive results from renewal and replacement leasing during for spaces that were previously occupied as demonstrated in the following table base rent base rent per square per square foot foot prior lease new lease increase stabilized malls associated centers community centers represents the rent that was in place at the end of the lease term 
average base rent over the term of the new lease 
excludes the community centers that were in the first phase of the galileo transaction 
liquidity and capital resources there was million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of december   an increase of million from december  cash flows from operations are used to fund short term liquidity and capital needs such as tenant construction allowances  capital expenditures and payments of dividends and distributions 
for longer term liquidity needs such as acquisitions  new developments  renovations and expansions  we typically rely on property specific mortgages which are generally non recourse  construction and term loans  revolving lines of credit  common stock  preferred stock  joint venture investments and a minority interest in the operating partnership 
cash flows cash provided by operating activities increased million to million 
although the addition of new properties and newly consolidated properties  combined with improved results at existing centers  contributed to an increase in operating cash flows  the increase was offset by decreases related to the timing of reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash used in investing activities increased million to million 
cash used to acquire real estate assets increased by million to million due to the acquisition of six malls and two associated centers during compared to three malls and one associated center acquired in cash paid for capital expenditures increased million to million primarily due to the company s investments in development projects  the renovations of six malls in and expenditures for tenant allowances and deferred maintenance 
the increases in cash outflows for investing activities were offset by an increase of million in net proceeds received from sales of real estate assets to million as a result of the galileo transaction and the sales of six community centers and outparcels in compared to five community centers  an office building and outparcels sold in additionally  we paid million to purchase the minority interest held by one of our former executive officers who retired in cash provided by financing activities increased million to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of debt retired in compared to this was partially offset by the redemption of our series a preferred stock and an increase in dividends and distributions paid

the secured and unsecured credit facilities contain  among other restrictions  certain financial covenants including the maintenance of certain coverage ratios  minimum net worth requirements  and limitations on cash flow distributions 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions under our credit facilities at december  additionally  certain property specific mortgage notes payable require the maintenance of debt service coverage ratios

the series c preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share per depositary share 
the net proceeds of million were used to partially fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
we redeemed the remaining  outstanding shares of the series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock at its face value of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends on november  we also recorded a charge of million to write off direct issuance costs that were recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital when the series a preferred stock was issued 
the charge was reflected in preferred dividends in the consolidated statement of operations

we have an effective shelf registration statement authorizing us to publicly issue shares of preferred stock  common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock with an aggregate public offering price up to million  of which approximately million remains after the series c preferred stock offering 
we anticipate that the combination of equity and debt sources will  for the foreseeable future  provide adequate liquidity to continue our capital programs substantially as in the past and make distributions to our shareholders in accordance with the requirements applicable to real estate investment trusts 
our policy is to maintain a conservative debt to total market capitalization ratio in order to enhance our access to the broadest range of capital markets  both public and private

as discussed in note  an additional obligation of  was recorded subsequent to december  when six additional community centers were sold to galileo america in january we have executed leases with tenants for certain spaces totaling  that will reduce the  to  capital expenditures we expect to continue to have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business 
future development and acquisition activities will be undertaken as suitable opportunities arise 
we do not expect to pursue these activities unless adequate sources of financing are available and a satisfactory budget with targeted returns on investment has been internally approved 
an annual capital expenditures budget is prepared for each property that is intended to provide for all necessary recurring and non recurring capital expenditures 
we believe that property operating cash flows  which include reimbursements from tenants for certain expenses  will provide the necessary funding for these expenditures

the costs of the remaining projects will be funded with operating cash flows and the credit facilities 
we have entered into a number of option agreements for the development of future regional malls and community centers 
except for the projects discussed under developments and expansions above  we do not have any other material capital commitments 
acquisitions we acquired six malls and two associated centers during for an aggregate purchase price of million  including transaction costs 
we assumed million of debt and paid million in cash to fund the purchase prices of these acquisitions 
the cash portion of the purchase prices was funded with borrowings under the credit facilities  proceeds from the series c preferred stock offering and proceeds from the galileo transaction 
these acquisitions are expected to generate an initial weighted average  unleveraged return of 
dispositions during  we generated aggregate net proceeds of million from the galileo transaction  the sales of six community centers and the sales of outparcels 
the net proceeds were used to either fund acquisitions  reduce borrowings under the credit facilities or were placed in escrow to be used in like kind exchanges 
in january  we sold six additional community centers to galileo america 
the net proceeds of million were used to deposit funds in escrow to be used in like kind exchanges and to reduce outstanding balances under our lines of credit 
other capital expenditures including our share of unconsolidated affiliates capital expenditures  we spent million in for tenant allowances  which generate increased rents from tenants over the terms of their leases 
deferred maintenance expenditures were million for and included million for resurfacing and improved lighting of parking lots  million for roof repairs and replacements and million for various other expenditures 
renovation expenditures were million in and included million for resurfacing and improved lighting of parking lots and million for roof repairs and replacements 
deferred maintenance expenditures are billed to tenants as common area maintenance expense  and most are recovered over a to year period 
renovation expenditures are primarily for remodeling and upgrades of malls  of which approximately is recovered from tenants over a to year period 
we expect to complete three renovation projects during at a total estimated cost of million  which will be funded from operating cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated affiliates we have ownership interests in ten unconsolidated affiliates that are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the following are circumstances when we may consider entering into a joint venture with a third party x third parties may approach us with opportunities where they have obtained land and performed some pre development activities  but they may not have sufficient access to the capital resources or the development and leasing expertise to bring the project to fruition 
we enter into such arrangements when we determine such a project is viable and we can achieve a satisfactory return 
we typically earn development fees from the joint venture and provide management and leasing services to the property once it is placed in operation 
x we determine that we may have the opportunity to capitalize on the value we have created in a property by selling an interest in a property to a third party 
this provides us with an additional source of capital that can be used to develop or acquire additional real estate assets that we believe will provide greater potential for growth 
when we retain an interest in an asset rather than selling a interest  it is typically because this allows us to continue to manage the property  which provides us the opportunity to earn fees for management  leasing  development  financing and acquisition services provided to the joint venture 
guarantees we have guaranteed of the debt to be incurred to develop the properties that will be owned by two of our joint ventures and of the debt of another joint venture 
we have issued these guarantees primarily because it allows the joint ventures to obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise 
this results in a higher return for the joint venture on its investment  and in a higher return on our investment in the joint venture 
we may receive a fee from the joint venture for providing the guaranty 
additionally  when we are required to perform under a guaranty  the terms of the guaranty typically provide that the joint venture partners interests in the joint venture is assigned to us  to the extent of our guaranty 
the company s guarantees and the related accounting are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion describes our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
revenue recognition minimum rental revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial terms of the related leases 
certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent if their sales volumes exceed thresholds specified in their lease agreements 
percentage rent is recognized as revenue when the thresholds are achieved and the amounts become determinable 
we receive reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance  and other recoverable operating expenses as provided in the lease agreements 
tenant reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period the related operating expenses are incurred 
tenant reimbursements related to certain capital expenditures are billed to tenants over periods of to years and are recognized as revenue when billed 
we receive management  leasing and development fees from third parties and unconsolidated affiliates 
management fees are charged as a percentage of revenues as defined in the management agreement and are recognized as revenue when earned 
development fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the development period 
leasing fees are charged for newly executed leases and lease renewals and are recognized as revenue when earned 
development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated affiliates during the development period are recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest 
fees to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate 
gains on sales of real estate assets are recognized when it is determined that the sale has been consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate  our receivable  if any  is not subject to future subordination  and the buyer has assumed the usual risks and rewards of ownership of the asset 
when we have an ownership interest in the buyer  gain is recognized to the extent of the third party partner s ownership interest and the portion of the gain attributable to our ownership interest is deferred 
real estate assets we capitalize predevelopment project costs paid to third parties 
all previously capitalized predevelopment costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the project will be completed 
once development of a project commences  all direct costs incurred to construct the project  including interest and real estate taxes  are capitalized 
additionally  certain general and administrative expenses are allocated to the projects and capitalized based on the amount of time applicable personnel work on the development project 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
major replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
all acquired real estate assets are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the results of operations are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
the purchase price is allocated to i tangible assets  consisting of land  buildings and improvements  and tenant improvements  ii and identifiable intangible assets generally consisting of above and below market leases and in place leases 
we use estimates of fair value based on estimated cash flows  using appropriate discount rates  and other valuation methods to allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets 
liabilities assumed generally consist of mortgage debt on the real estate assets acquired 
assumed debt with a stated interest rate that is significantly different from market interest rates is recorded at its fair value based on estimated market interest rates at the date of acquisition 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over estimated lives of years for buildings  to years for certain improvements and to years for equipment and fixtures 
tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
lease related intangibles from acquisitions of real estate assets are amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases 
any difference between the face value of the debt assumed and its fair value is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt using the effective interest method 
carrying value of long lived assets we periodically evaluate long lived assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and record impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment 
if it is determined that an impairment has occurred  the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value will be charged to operations 
there were no impairment charges in  and recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which rescinds sfas no 
as a result  gains and losses from extinguishments of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and have presented losses from extinguishments of debt as an ordinary expense in all periods presented 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of sfas no 
  and  and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee at the inception of a guarantee 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of fasb interpretation no 
in the fourth quarter and adopted the remaining provisions effective january  see note for disclosures related to our guarantees 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
fasb interpretation no 
was revised in december and the adoption date was postponed until the first interim or annual period ending after march  although we are still evaluating the impact of the revised interpretation  we believe it is reasonably possible that one unconsolidated affiliate that is currently accounted for using the equity method may be a variable interest entity under the provisions of the interpretation 
we own a interest and have a total investment of  in this unconsolidated affiliate  which owns one associated center and two community centers 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
in particular  sfas no 
clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in sfas no 
and it clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  and is to be applied prospectively 
we did not engage in any activities after june  to which sfas no 
applied 
we do not believe that the implementation of sfas no 
will materially change our accounting for the kinds of derivatives that we have typically obtained in the course of our regular financing activities 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which specifies that instruments within its scope are obligations of the issuer and  therefore  the issuer must classify them as liabilities 
financial instruments within the scope of the pronouncement include mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  obligations to repurchase the issuer s equity shares by transferring assets  and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  however  on october   the fasb indefinitely deferred the provisions of paragraphs and of sfas no 
related to noncontrolling interests in limited life subsidiaries 
if we were required to comply with the provisions of paragraphs and of sfas as currently drafted  we would reclassify amounts currently included in minority interests of  and record the minority partners interest as a liability at its estimated current liquidation amount  which would result in a charge to earnings of  this liability would be reviewed each quarter and changes in its current liquidation amount recorded through interest expense 
impact of inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations because of the relatively low inflation rate 
substantially all tenant leases do  however  contain provisions designed to protect us from the impact of inflation 
these provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than years which may provide us the opportunity to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rent if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  which reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that supplements net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis 
we define ffo available for distribution as defined above by nareit less dividends on preferred stock 
during the first quarter of  we began to include gains and losses on sales of outparcels in ffo to comply with the securities and exchange commission s rules related to disclosure of non gaap financial measures 
ffo for prior periods has been restated to include gains and losses on sales of outparcels 
our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
we believe that ffo provides an additional indicator of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization  which assumes the value of real estate assets declines predictably over time 
since values of well maintained real estate assets have historically risen with market conditions  we believe that ffo enhances investors understanding of our operating performance 
the use of ffo as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of our properties and interest rates  but also by our capital structure 
accordingly  ffo will be one of the significant factors considered by the board of directors in determining the amount of cash distributions the operating partnership will make to its partners  including the reit 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income for purposes of evaluating our operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
ffo increased in to million compared to million in the new properties and the newly consolidated properties generated of the growth in ffo 
consistently high portfolio occupancy  increases in rental rates from renewal and replacement leasing and increased recoveries of operating expenses accounted for the remaining growth in ffo 
the calculation of ffo is as follows in thousands year ended december  net income available to common shareholders    add depreciation and amortization from consolidated properties    depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated affiliates    depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations  minority interest in earnings of operating partnership    less gains on disposal of operating real estate assets   minority investors share of depreciation and amortization    gain on discontinued operations  depreciation and amortization of non real estate assets funds from operations    ffo applicable to company shareholders    supplemental ffo information straight line rental income    gains on outparcel sales    rental revenue recognized under sfas nos 
and amortization of debt premiums item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to interest rate risk on its debt obligations and derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and not for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk management policy requires that derivative instruments be used for hedging purposes only and that they be entered into only with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors 
based on our proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated variable rate debt at december   a increase or decrease in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase or decrease annual cash flows by approximately million and  after the effect of capitalized interest  annual earnings by approximately million 
based on our proportionate share of total consolidated and unconsolidated debt at december   a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately million  while a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately million 
the company had one interest rate cap agreement of on million of variable rate debt 
the interest rate cap matures in may and its fair value was zero at december
