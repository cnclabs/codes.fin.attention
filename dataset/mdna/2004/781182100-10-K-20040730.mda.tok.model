item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview ruby tuesday  inc rti or the company owns and operates ruby tuesday casual dining restaurants 
we also franchise the ruby tuesday concept in selected domestic and international markets 
as of fiscal year end  we owned and operated ruby tuesday restaurants  located in states and the district of columbia 
we also own or of the equity of each of domestic franchisees with the balance of the equity in these franchisees being owned by the various operators of the franchise businesses 
as of year end  these franchisees  which we refer to as franchise partnerships  operated restaurants 
our other franchisees  domestic and international  operated restaurants 
rti s franchisees operate restaurants in states and puerto rico and foreign countries 
casual dining  the segment of the restaurant industry in which we operate  is intensely competitive with respect to prices  services  locations and the types and quality of food 
we compete with other food service operations  including locally owned restaurants  and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer the same or similar types of services and products as we do 
our industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  national  regional or local conditions  demographic trends  traffic patterns  and the types  numbers and locations of competing restaurants 
there also is significant competition in the restaurant industry for management personnel and for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants 
our historical results have been achieved by using a blend of successful factors  including the following providing casual food in a fun atmosphere for a reasonable price  being an operations driven company  with hands on leadership  opening successful units  providing real time information and analysis to restaurant management teams  leveraging brand and support services through franchising  quickly responding to new opportunities  and increasing average unit volumes 
our performance goals focus on measurements we believe are key to our growth and progress  including  but not limited to  same store sales  new unit openings  and pre tax margins 
our performance in these areas is discussed throughout this managment s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
we remind you that  in order to best obtain an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the last three fiscal years  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
references to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor s understanding of the franchise system  including franchise partnerships and traditional domestic and international franchisees 
franchise system revenues are not included in  and are not  revenues of ruby tuesday  inc however  we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities  which includes royalties  and  in the case of our franchise partnership system  our support service income and equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises 
franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information which we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor

rti s increase in company restaurant sales in fiscal is attributable to growth in the number of restaurants coupled with same store sales growth and higher average unit volumes 
same store sales for company owned units increased in fiscal no units were sold to franchisees refranchised during the year 
franchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business 
franchise royalties generally of monthly sales are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis 
franchise revenue increased to million and to million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increases are primarily attributable to growth of the domestic franchise partnership and international franchise programs 
total franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below

rti franchise sales increased in fiscal due to growth in the number of restaurants and an increase in average unit volumes

back to table of contents ruby tuesday restaurants the table below presents the number of ruby tuesday concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal through fiscal fiscal year company owned franchise total overview during fiscal  we opened ruby tuesday restaurants  and closed six ruby tuesday restaurants due to lease terminations 
during fiscal  we opened ruby tuesday restaurants  and closed the following restaurants four due to lease terminations  and three that were not meeting management s expectations 
each of these restaurants was closed as part of upgrading our portfolio of restaurants 
our franchisees entered into development agreements with us whereby they committed to open a specified number of ruby tuesday restaurants in their assigned territories over a specific period of time 
pursuant to development agreements  ruby tuesday franchise restaurants franchise partnership and traditional were opened during fiscal and ruby tuesday franchise restaurants franchise partnership and eight traditional were opened during fiscal impact of recently adopted accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
the interpretation replaces the original fasb interpretation no 
fin  which had been issued on january  fin r addresses the consolidation of entities in which a reporting enterprise has an economic interest  but for which the traditional voting interest approach to consolidation ie  an approach based on voting rights is ineffective in identifying where control of the entity really lies  or in which the equity investors do not bear the economic risks and rewards of the entity 
fin r refers to those entities as variable interest entities vies 
fin r requires the consolidation of the vie by the primary beneficiary  if any  of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity which is required to absorb the majority of the economic risks or receive a majority of the expected economic rewards of the vie 
fin r is required to be adopted in financial statements for periods ending after march  the entities in which we have a variable interest include the traditional franchisees and the franchise partnerships 
from the time of issuance of fin until recently  we have disclosed the possibility that some or all of the franchise partnerships might be consolidated upon adoption of fin our disclosures were made based upon review of accounting literature as it was then drafted and with consideration given to our partial ownership we own or of each of the franchise partnerships  our acquisition loans to certain franchise partnerships created in refranchising situations  our limited guarantees on certain franchise partnership debt  and other support we provide to franchise partnerships 

back to table of contents fin r provided clearer guidance for franchisors by  among other things  including a business scope exception 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  we reviewed all of our franchise relationships and concluded that all of the franchise entities meet the definition of a business as defined in fin r  and should  unless the level of support or nature of the relationship changes  be excluded from the scope of fin r  and thus not consolidated 
we adopted fin r effective june   and we did not consolidate any franchisee  or other entity  as a result of the adoption 
pre tax profit for fiscal  pre tax profit was million or of total revenue  as compared to million or of total revenue  for fiscal the primary contributors to the increase as a percentage of revenue were savings we realized in cost of merchandise and payroll and related costs  both of which are discussed below 
pre tax profit for fiscal was million after consideration of a pre tax loss of million related to the specialty restaurant group  llc srg note receivable the srg note 
we wrote off the srg note in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to a number of factors  all of which related to srg s declining operating performance and the receipt of notification on april  from srg s senior lender that payments due to us under the srg note were to be halted as a result of srg s covenant defaults 
a reconciliation of earnings excluding the loss on valuation of the srg note to the reported financial results is as follows as reported including loss on valuation of srg note effect of loss on valuation of srg note excluding loss on valuation of srg note fiscal income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for income taxes cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income earnings per share basic diluted we believe comparisons in our discussions and analyses  excluding the loss on valuation of the srg note  are more useful to investors because they reflect adjustments for a one time  non recurring charge 
this permits a more meaningful comparison of our operating performance between fiscal and

the increase was attributable to growth in the number of units  higher average unit volumes  increased franchising revenues  and a reduction  as a percentage of revenue  of cost of merchandise  payroll and related costs  and other restaurant operating costs as discussed below 
pre tax income increased million in fiscal to million 
excluding the loss on the srg note receivable in fiscal  pre tax income for fiscal increased million  or 
the reported increase was due to growth in the number of units  higher average unit volumes  increased franchising revenue  and a reduction  as a percentage of revenue  of cost of merchandise  other restaurant operating costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses as discussed below as well as the prior year loss on valuation of the srg note 
cost of merchandise cost of merchandise  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  decreased in fiscal and in fiscal primarily due to declining food costs with the roll out of a new menu in march additionally  the decrease in fiscal was attributable to the roll out of our new smart eating sm menu  which features lower food cost  but higher percentage gross margin  items such as wraps 
payroll and related costs payroll and related costs decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue in fiscal due to the prior year investment in training for our new service initiatives and a current year focus on decreasing hourly labor during operating periods outside of lunch and dinner shifts 
the decrease is also attributable to labor efficiencies resulting from the march new menu and savings associated with the utilization of more pre cut produce  which decreased the amount of preparation time required for various menu items 
for fiscal  payroll and related costs increased as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  due to a continued focus on staffing levels and additional training costs incurred in transitioning units to our then current service initiatives 
higher worker s compensation claims expense also contributed to the increase in payroll and related costs 

back to table of contents other restaurant operating costs other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  decreased in fiscal primarily due to lower rent expense  which is a result of a focus on opening units in which we own the land and building as opposed to leased units  and general liability insurance expense  due to favorable claims experience 
the lower rent expense is offset by an increase in repairs  as we committed additional funds in fiscal to maintain or improve the overall appearance of our units 
for fiscal  other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  decreased primarily due to the refinancing of our bank financed operating lease agreements with traditional bank debt and the corresponding purchase of the underlying properties  which resulted in rent expense for the operating leases being replaced by interest and depreciation expense for the owned units  lower closing expense due in part to fewer closings in fiscal and lower asset impairment charges in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal as a result of the refinancing of our bank financed operating leases in fiscal and our continued focus on opening units in which we own the land and building 
for fiscal  depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased as a result of the acquisition of properties previously leased as part of the refinancing of the bank financed operating leases discussed above 
loss on srg note receivable during fiscal  rti recorded a loss on the srg note of million 
we wrote off the srg note due to a number of factors  all of which related to srg s declining operating performance and the receipt of notification on april  from srg s senior lender that note payments due to us were to be halted as a result of srg s covenant defaults 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  increased in fiscal the increase is attributable to an increase in marketing and public relations costs related to the to go and ruby tuesday smart eating campaigns  increased management labor due to the addition of new directors of people  standards and results  or dpsr s  our multi unit operators  in order to reduce the span of control for each dpsr  increased advertising costs for the production of television commercials used for media testing during the first quarter of fiscal  and higher collateral production costs due to the roll out of the new menu as well as new plastic menu covers 
these increases are offset by higher support service fees from franchises and srg 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue 
the decrease is attributable to higher average unit volumes coupled with higher support service fees from franchises and srg 
other decreases include lower equipment rent expenses due to the buyout of certain computer leases and lower information technology costs due to bringing unit level technology costs in house 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises for fiscal  our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated franchises increased to million from million in fiscal  due to increased earnings attributable to the owned franchise partnerships coupled with the earnings attributable to four partnerships in which we acquired an additional equity interest in fiscal for fiscal  our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated franchises increased to million from million in fiscal  for the same reasons 
as in fiscal  we acquired an additional equity interest in four partnerships in fiscal our agreements with franchise partnerships allow us to purchase an additional equity interest for million 
we have chosen to exercise that option in situations in which we expect to earn a return similar to or better than that which we expect when we invest in new restaurants 
during each of fiscal and fiscal  we exercised our right to acquire an 
back to table of contents additional equity interest in four franchise partnerships bringing our total ownership in each of these franchisees to 
as of the end of fiscal  the company held a interest in each of franchise partnerships collectively operating ruby tuesday restaurants 
net interest expense income net interest expense increased million in fiscal primarily due to lower interest income on the franchise partnership notes receivable which were a part of the purchase price paid by certain franchise partnerships in refranchising transactions 
we collected million net on these notes during fiscal and forgave certain of the notes late in fiscal  both of which contributed to the year over year decrease in interest income 
for fiscal  net interest expense increased million to million primarily due to the credit facility entered into in the first quarter of that year to refinance the bank financed operating leases and the private sale in fiscal s fourth quarter of company notes in the amount of million 
in addition  interest income decreased in fiscal due to the write off of the srg note in the fourth quarter of fiscal see the borrowings and credit facilities section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on these two transactions 
the amount of interest recorded as income but not received in cash decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as the number of franchisees contractually required to pay interest increased 
as of june  all of the franchise partnerships were making interest and or principal payments on a monthly basis in accordance with the terms of the notes receivable 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was  up from in fiscal the change in the effective rate was primarily due to an increase in state taxes during fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal  was  down from in fiscal  excluding the tax impact of the loss on the srg note 
the change in the effective rate was due to an increase in tax credits during fiscal the effective income tax rate including the loss on the srg note  which was deducted at statutory rates  was in fiscal liquidity and capital resources rti s cash from operations and excess borrowing capacity allow us to pursue our growth strategies and targeted capital structure 
accordingly  we have established certain well defined priorities for our operating cash flow invest wisely in new assets and maintain our commitment to high return  low risk growth to increase profitability 
continue to make investments in our team members and our existing assets in order to provide superior guest and team satisfaction 
repurchase our common stock in order to maintain our target capital structure and return excess capital to our shareholders and provide further capital return to our shareholders through our dividend program  started in fiscal 
back to table of contents sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
principal uses of cash are capital expenditures  share repurchases  payments on debt  and payments of dividends 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in thousands 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and short term investments we require capital principally for new restaurant construction  investments in technology  equipment replacement  and remodeling of existing restaurants 
property and equipment expenditures purchased primarily with internally generated cash flows for fiscal were million 
in addition  in fiscal we invested an additional million above normal spending in order to maintain our facilities in top notch condition 
this spending is included in other restaurant operating costs in the consolidated statement of income and is excluded from capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for fiscal are budgeted to be approximately to million based on our expectation that we will open units in fiscal we also have budgeted amounts for ongoing refurbishment and capital replacement for existing restaurants  and the enhancement of information systems 
we intend to fund capital expenditures for company owned restaurants with cash provided by operations 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
borrowings and credit facilities rti has a million revolving credit facility the revolver which includes a million current line and a million sub limit for letters of credit 
at june   we had borrowings of million outstanding under the revolver with an associated floating rate of 
the revolver is scheduled to mature on october  during fiscal  we concluded the private sale of million of non collateralized senior notes the private placement 
the private placement consisted of million with a fixed interest rate of the series a notes and million with a fixed interest rate of the series b notes 
the series a notes and series b notes mature on april  and april   respectively 
proceeds from the private placement were used to pay off a million term loan as well as to pay down million of the revolving credit balance then outstanding 
at june   we had borrowings of million on the revolver with an associated floating rate of 
during fiscal  we expect to fund operations  capital expansion  any repurchase of common stock  and the payment of dividends from operating cash flows  our revolver  and operating leases

off balance sheet arrangements since  our franchise partnerships have been offered a credit facility for which we provide a partial guarantee 
the current credit facility  which has been negotiated with various lenders  is a million credit facility to assist franchise partnerships with working capital and operational cash flow requirements 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on october  we renewed this credit facility with various lenders 
as sponsor of the credit facility  we serve as partial guarantor of the draws made on this revolving line of credit 
the renewal extended the termination date to october  and reduced the term of the individual franchise partnership loan commitments from to months 
the renewal further allowed rti to increase the amount of the facility by up to million to a total of million or  if desired  to reduce the amount of the facility 
other changes to the program were not significant 

back to table of contents rti has also entered into an arrangement with a third party lender on july   under which we may partially guarantee up to million in total specific loans for new franchise restaurant development 
guarantees under this program will generally be to  and in certain circumstances  up to of amounts borrowed 
should payments be required under this program  rti has certain rights to acquire the operating restaurants after the third party debt is paid 
on july   rti terminated million guarantee program  which had outstanding guarantees of million at june  as of june   the amounts we guaranteed under all of these programs totaled million 
as consideration for providing these guarantees  we received million in fiscal as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and noted below  rti has certain divestiture guarantees with morrison fresh cooking  inc mfc and morrison health care  inc 
mhc which arose in in connection with the distribution of mfc subsequently acquired by piccadilly cafeterias  inc  or piccadilly and mhc subsequently acquired by compass group  plc  or compass businesses 
contingent liabilities resulting from these guarantees include payments due to mfc and mhc employees retiring under two non qualified defined benefit plans  which existed at the time of the distribution  and for payments due on eight named workers compensation and general liability claims 
additionally  as a sponsor of the morrison restaurants inc retirement plan the retirement plan  we  along with mfc and mhc  can be held responsible for benefits due to all of the retirement plan s participants 
as a result of piccadilly bankruptcy discussed herein  we will likely be called upon to perform as required by the mfc guarantees 
the amounts we expect to pay represent of the total amounts due as we expect to share liabilities equally with mhc  which is also contingently liable 
during fiscal  we made payments to the retirement plan s trust totaling million on behalf of piccadilly 
at june   we have recorded liabilities totaling million relative to our estimated share of the mfc benefit plan liabilities 
this amount assumes no recovery in the bankruptcy proceeding 
the actual amount we may be ultimately required to pay could be lower if there is any recovery in the bankruptcy proceeding  or could be higher if more valid participants are identified or if actuarial assumptions are ultimately proven inaccurate 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
our contingent liability relative to mhc is estimated at to be million at june  and includes mhc s share of the million employee benefit plan liability  along with the amounts for which we would be liable relative to the employees of mhc 
we currently do not anticipate having to pay any amounts on behalf of mhc due to our positive perception of mhc s financial strength and accordingly no amounts have been recorded relative to our mhc contingent liability 
we have an employment agreement with samuel e 
beall  iii  whereby he has agreed to serve as chief executive officer of the company until june  in accordance with the agreement  mr 
beall is compensated at a base salary adjusted annually based on various company or market factors and is entitled to an annual bonus opportunity and a long term incentive compensation program  which currently includes stock option grants and life insurance coverage 
the employment agreement also provides for certain severance payments to be made in the event of a termination other than for cause  or a change in control  the circumstances of which are defined in the agreement 
as of june   the total of the potential liability for severance payments with regard to the employment agreement was approximately million 

back to table of contents significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments long term financial obligations were as follows as of june  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years notes payable and other long term debt  including current maturities a revolving credit facility a unsecured senior notes series a and b a operating leases  net of sublease payments b purchase obligations c total a see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
b see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
c the amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for food items and supplies  construction projects  and other miscellaneous commitments 
for purposes of calculating total debt to capital  we include as debt all of the above on balance sheet debt  plus the present value of operating leases  letters of credit  and franchisee loan guarantees 
commercial commitments in thousands total at june  letters of credit franchisee loan guarantees divestiture guarantees see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
our working capital deficiency and current ratio as of june  were million and  respectively 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because cash a current asset generated from operating activities is reinvested in capital expenditures a long term asset and receivable and inventory levels are generally not significant 
pension plans funded status rti is a sponsor of the retirement plan along with the two companies that were spun off as a result of the fiscal spin off transaction mfc and mhc 
the retirement plan was established to provide retirement benefits to qualifying employees of morrison restaurants inc under the retirement plan  participants are entitled to receive benefits based upon salary and length of service 
the retirement plan was amended as of december   so that no additional benefits will accrue and no new participants will enter the retirement plan after that date 
certain responsibilities involving the administration of the retirement plan are jointly shared by each of the three companies 
the sponsors are jointly and severally required to contribute such amounts as are necessary to satisfy all benefit obligations under the retirement plan 
as discussed in more detail in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  piccadilly announced on october  that it had filed for chapter protection under the united states bankruptcy code 
on march   piccadilly s assets and ongoing business operations were sold to a third party for million 
rti has filed a claim against piccadilly as part of the bankruptcy proceedings in the amount of approximately million 
it is not known at this time how much  if any  of such claim will be allowed 
as a result of piccadilly s failure to make required payments to the retirement plan  rti paid million during fiscal to the retirement plan s trust on behalf of piccadilly 
to the best of our 
back to table of contents knowledge  mhc or compass has made all contributions required of mhc  including a payment of million during fiscal on behalf of piccadilly 
in addition to the million in payments made on behalf of piccadilly for the benefit of employees of mfc  during fiscal  rti made total contributions to the retirement plan totaling million for the benefit of rti employees 
as of june   we have recorded a liability of million representing rti s share of piccadilly s retirement plan liability 
we expect to make contributions in fiscal totaling million for rti employees and million for the benefit of mfc employees 
rti also sponsors two additional non funded pension plans  the executive supplemental pension plan and the management retirement plan 
although these plans are legally considered to be unfunded  the company does provide a source for the payment of benefits under these two plans in the form of company owned life insurance policies 
the cash value of these policies was million at june  the management retirement plan was amended effective june  such that no additional benefits would accrue and no new participants may enter the plan after that date 
we also expect to have some liability to the mfc employees who had an accrued benefit at the time of mfc s spin off from rti march 
based on estimates prepared with the assistance of our independent actuaries  we have recorded a liability of million on behalf of mfc participants relative to these plans 
as with the retirement plan  the extent of any recovery in the bankruptcy proceeding is unknown at this time 
as of our march  measurement date  these three plans had a total projected benefit obligation pbo of million  and an accumulated benefit obligation abo of million 
the combined fair value of plan assets  including the company owned life insurance policies and a contribution of million made to the retirement plan after the measurement date but before june   was million 
as a result of the underfunded status of the three plans relative to the combined pbo  we have recorded an million charge to shareholders equity net of tax of million as of june  the pbo and abo reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees 
the pbo incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the abo reflects only current compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time period over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo and abo are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
we measured our pbo and abo using a discount rate of at march  due to stock market declines  the retirement plan assets experienced losses in value in fiscal and fiscal totaling million and million  respectively 
because of these declines  we changed our expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to in fiscal we believed this assumption to be appropriate given the composition of plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
despite a recovery in fiscal  a year in which plan assets earned million  we will continue to use the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption for the determination of pension expense in fiscal due to the addition of mfc participants and for various other reasons  we expect pension expense to increase approximately million in fiscal we have incorporated this incremental expense into our annual budgets and outlook 
we do not believe that the underfunded status of the three pension plans will materially affect our financial position or cash flows in fiscal or in future years 
given current funding levels and discount rates we anticipate making contributions to more fully fund the pension plans over the course of the next five to ten years 
we believe our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to allow us to make necessary contributions to the three plans 
we have included known and expected increases in our pension expense as well as future expected plan contributions in our annual budgets and outlook 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
dividends during fiscal  our board of directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to rti s shareholders 
this policy calls for payment of semi annual dividends of per share 
in accordance with this policy  we paid dividends of million in fiscal the payment of a dividend in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain  however  at the discretion of the board of directors and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future 
additionally  our credit facilities contain certain limitations on the payment of dividends 
see special note regarding forward looking information below below 

back to table of contents critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets each quarter we evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant that has been open for at least five quarters when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of such restaurant may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we consider the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the restaurant  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
fair value is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected terminal value 
in the instance of a potential sale of a restaurant in a refranchising transaction  the expected purchase price is used as the estimate of fair value 
restaurants open for less than five quarters are considered new and are excluded from our impairment review 
we believe this provides sufficient time to establish the presence of the restaurant in the market and build a customer base 
approximately of our restaurants have been open for less than five quarters and have not been evaluated for potential impairment 
if a restaurant that has been open for at least five quarters shows negative cash flow results  we prepare a plan to reverse the negative performance 
under our policies  recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment 
both qualitative and quantitative information is considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
the amount of impairment loss recognized is based on the difference between discounted projected cash flows in the case of some negative cash flow restaurants only salvage value is used and the current net book value 
during the past four fiscal quarters  we have not had more than six open units with rolling month negative cash flows 
company same store sales during that same period of time ranged from to per fiscal quarter 
of these six units  only two have generally had an annual negative cash flow amount in excess of  they have been below  and one of these units is now below  and has a net book value that would approximate salvage value 
the combined month cash flow loss at these six units was approximately million 
we reviewed the plans to reverse negative cash flows at each of the six units with negative cash flows for the months ended june  and concluded that recorded book values were recoverable at june  considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  including cash flows from continuing use  terminal value  closure costs  and sublease income 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful notes and interest income we follow a systematic methodology each quarter in our analysis of franchise and other notes receivable in order to estimate losses inherent at the balance sheet date 
a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio involves reviewing the following for each significant borrower terms including interest rate  original note date  payoff date  and principal and interest start dates  note amounts including the original balance  current balance  associated debt guarantees  and total exposure  and 
back to table of contents other relevant information including whether the borrower is making timely interest  principal  royalty and support payments  the borrower s debt coverage ratios  the borrower s current financial condition and sales trends  the borrower s additional borrowing capacity  and  as appropriate  management s judgment on the quality of the borrower s operations 
based on the results of this analysis  the allowance for doubtful notes is adjusted as appropriate 
no portion of the allowance for doubtful notes is allocated to guarantees 
in the event that collection is deemed to be an issue  a number of actions to resolve the issue are possible  including the purchase of the franchised restaurants by us or a replacement franchisee  modification to the terms of payment of franchise fees or note obligations  or a restructuring of the borrower s debt to better position the borrower to fulfill its obligations 
at june  the allowance for doubtful notes was million  of which million was assigned to notes that were not franchise related 
we recognize interest income on notes receivable when earned which sometimes precedes collection 
a number of our franchise notes have  since the inception of these notes  allowed for the deferral of interest during the first one to three years 
although all franchisees that issued notes to us are currently paying interest on these notes  it is our policy to cease accruing interest income and recognize interest on a cash basis when we determine that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the same analysis noted above for doubtful notes is utilized in determining whether to cease recognizing interest income and thereafter record interest payments on the cash basis 
estimated liability for self insurance we self insure a portion of our current and past losses from workers compensation and general liability claims 
we have stop loss insurance for individual claims for workers compensation and general liability in excess of stated loss amounts 
insurance liabilities are recorded based on independent actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses  net of payments made 
the estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the company and supplemental information as appropriate 
the analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including  but not limited to  a the quality of historical loss and exposure information  b the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience  c the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the company  and d projected payrolls and revenue 
as claims develop  the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates 
therefore  an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required 
income tax valuation allowances and tax accruals we record deferred tax assets for various items 
as of june   we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the future tax deductions attributable to our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore no valuation allowance has been provided 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities 
we record appropriate accruals for potential exposures should a taxing authority take a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these accruals  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate tax liability 
known events  uncertainties and trends financial strategy and stock repurchase plan our financial strategy is to utilize a prudent amount of debt  including operating leases  to minimize the weighted average cost of capital while allowing financial flexibility and the equivalent of an investment grade bond rating 
this strategy allows us to repurchase rti common stock at times when cash flow exceeds capital expenditures and other funding requirements 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of rti common stock for a total purchase price of million 
the total number of remaining shares authorized to be

to the extent not funded with cash from operating activities  additional repurchases  if any  may be funded by borrowings on the revolver 
franchising and development agreements as of june   rti held a equity interest in each of franchise partnerships  which collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants 
we may choose to exercise our rights to acquire an additional equity interest in franchise partnerships in fiscal and beyond

impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  supplies  real estate and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results 
historically  we have been able to recover inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements 
competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases 
historically  the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income 
management s outlook we continue to strategically position the company for growth through the continuing emphasis on our ruby tuesday brand and our franchise programs

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
the interest rate charged on our revolver can vary based on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our options for the rate are the base rate or libor plus an applicable margin 
the base rate is defined to be the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the applicable margin for the libor based option is a percentage ranging from to 
as of june   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of  per year 
as an additional method of managing our interest rate exposure on our floating rate debt  at certain times we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we agreed to pay over the life of the swaps a fixed interest rate payment on a notional amount and in exchange we received a floating rate payment calculated on the same amount over the same time period 
we began the year with two interest rate swap agreements totaling million  both of which matured and were not replaced 
many of the ingredients used in the products we sell in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
this volatility may be due to factors outside our control such as weather and seasonality 
we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients 
historically  and subject to competitive market conditions  we have been able to mitigate the negative impact of price volatility through adjustments to average check or menu mix
