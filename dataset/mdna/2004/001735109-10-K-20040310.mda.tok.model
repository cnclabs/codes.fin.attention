item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of amli residential properties trust the company or amli as of december  and and for the years ended december   and  and related notes 
the terms we  us or our when used in this discussion and analysis mean the company or amli 
dollars are in thousands  except share data  rental rates and expenditures per unit 
overview as of december   amli owned an approximate general partnership interest in amli residential properties  lp the operating partnership or op  which holds the operating assets of amli 
the not owned by amli is owned by the limited partners that hold operating partnership units op units which are convertible into common shares of amli on a one for one basis  subject to certain limitations 
at december   amli owned  op units including  preferred op units and the limited partners owned  op units 
amli has qualified  and anticipates continuing to qualify  as a real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes 
amli management company amc and amli institutional advisors  inc aia are each a service company subsidiary collectively the service companies  which provide property management  construction  and institutional advisory services for amli and its co investment partnerships 
the service companies elected taxable reit subsidiary trs status for internal revenue service irs reporting purposes 
amli residential construction  llc amrescon is a wholly owned subsidiary of amc and has also elected to be a trs 
amli is one of the largest owners and operators of multifamily apartment communities in the united states having a focus on the upscale segment of the market with investments and operations in eight major markets in four regions in the united states 
over time  amli expects to selectively increase the number of markets in which it operates  thereby continuing its plan of long term diversification that it has had since its initial offering 
through investment in  and operation of  income producing apartment communities  amli primarily seeks to maximize operating earnings by increasing the net operating income noi from its portfolio of operating communities internal growth  and by adding additional noi by expanding the portfolio through its acquisition and development activities external growth 
in addition  amli employs a third external growth strategy  co investment  whereby amli earns additional fee income and other compensation from forming partnerships with primarily institutional partners for the purpose of acquiring and developing multifamily communities 
to support its growth strategies  amli has the internal expertise to develop and construct new communities  acquire existing assets from third parties  manage its assets and source debt and equity capital 
amli s primary sources of revenue  which generate cash  include rental and other income earned from the leasing of its apartment homes  which are  in general  reflected directly in amli s consolidated statements of operations if the investment is a wholly owned community or in income from partnerships if amli s investment is in a co investment community 
property management fees earned by amc 
construction management fees earned by amrescon 
fees and other compensation from its co investment business 
gains from sales of amli s interests in the communities 
the discussion which follows includes management s view of the us apartment industry and of amli s position within this industry 
the us apartment industry is a mature one  having a long history of providing housing for a substantial number of the country s residents 
apartments  along with office  retail and industrial  are considered the four main real estate asset investment classes 
apartment investing has historically been recognized as providing a high level of risk adjusted returns compared to other real estate investments 
among the relative attractions of investing in apartments are the ability to maintain occupancy during different economic environments and the relatively lesser amount of capital expenditures needed to maintain  operate and lease an apartment community 
the apartment industry is very competitive 
there are many owners  operators and investors nationally and in each of the markets in which amli operates 
all of amli s communities are subject to competition from other apartment communities and segments of the for sale housing market 
amli s current and potential residents generally have a wide variety of alternative housing choices 
notwithstanding  amli s communities are very competitive in their local marketplaces  and amli s business and operating strategies are designed to promote the benefits of living in an amli community 
the amount of rental and other community related income that amli earns is primarily a function of the relative demand for apartments compared to the available supply in the market at a point in time 
a primary driver of demand in the apartment business is job growth 
net job losses as a result of the weak economic environment in the united states  particularly since the terrorist attacks on the world trade center in september  have caused a reduction in demand 
additionally  historically low interest rates have encouraged for sale construction  and purchases of single family homes  townhomes and condominiums  which have been at all time highs the last few years 
there is a natural spread between the cost of home ownership and the cost of apartment rental  and as interest rates fell faster than apartment rents  many in the us were encouraged to move out of apartments 
nevertheless  investment demand for apartments has been very high  causing many merchant builders to continue to develop new communities 
weaker demand coupled with greater supply has caused amli to drop rental rates across all of its markets during the last two years in order to increase or maintain occupancy 
the net effective rents and occupancy levels of amli s communities are very competitive 
during  amli experienced an increase in occupancy  but was generally limited in its ability to raise rents 
amli is cautiously projecting a modest increase in total rental revenue from its same store communities in compared to  but continues to be exposed to decreasing rents if additional supply outpaces demand 
amli has continued to invest in its communities during this recession  and the physical condition of amli s portfolio  as a whole  is excellent 
community rental expenses eg including personnel costs  real estate taxes  utilities  insurance and repair and maintenance have annually increased  even as revenue have decreased 
notwithstanding a slight increase in amli s communities operating expense ratio during  amli s communities operated at a gross profit margin of 
weaker economic conditions have also negatively impacted the amount of property management fees earned by amc  as such fees are based on a percentage of each community s gross revenue 
amli has also slowed its development and construction activities over the last two years  resulting in a lesser amount of development fees earned by the operating partnership and a lesser amount of construction management fees earned by amrescon 
amli only earns development fees when it provides such services to a co investment partnership  whereas amrescon earns construction management fees in its performance as the general contractor whether the community is developed wholly owned or in co investment 
amli believes that the operating prospects for its existing development communities remain acceptable based upon current economic and other conditions existing in the areas in which amli s development activities are occurring 
there are uncertainties and risks with any development project 
while amli has prepared development budgets and has estimated completion and stabilization target dates for each of the development communities based upon what it believes are reasonable assumptions  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed current budgets or that amli will not experience construction delays due to the unavailability of building materials  weather conditions or other events beyond amli s control 
similarly  adverse market conditions at the time that the development communities become available for leasing could affect the rental rates that may be charged and the period necessary to achieve stabilization at the development communities 
notwithstanding  amli has an excellent development track record and does not currently expect any significant costs to be incurred in excess of its current budgets  nor does it expect any significant delays in the delivery of completed units 
four of the five communities being developed in which the operating partnership owns an interest  and one of the two communities being developed by amrescon  are currently expected to be completed and initially leased to stabilization during four of such seven developments are co investment communities 
amli s current estimate of its share of equity needed to complete the development and lease up of all seven communities is approximately  net of available construction financing and co investment partner contributions  an amount which amli has available to it 
in addition to development fees  amli has historically earned acquisition and other fees by acquiring communities in co investment partnerships  however  was the first time in amli s history that it did not do so and  as such  did not earn any acquisition fees 
amli is expecting to incur in increased general and administrative expenses during as it complies with various new legislation dealing with corporate governance 
such expenses include those associated with formalizing an internal audit function 
although operating earnings have decreased each of the last three years  amli has maintained a consistent quarterly dividend rate  which has been covered by annual operating cash flow 
amli s current projections for anticipate a reduced dividend payout ratio  a situation that amli closely monitors to make sure that it does not over commit beyond its resources nor become too illiquid to satisfy short term obligations 
amli believes that its balance sheet is reasonably strong and there is no debt related stress that is foreseeable 
in recent years amli has sought to increase the size of its portfolio through development and acquisition opportunities  net of dispositions  however  due to asset pricing and other factors amli has not been an aggressive investor during such period 
amli has debt and equity capital available to it and may consider expanding its investment activities in critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for investments in and transactions with unconsolidated partnerships amli acquires and develops multifamily communities in co investment partnerships with partners  primarily institutional investors such as insurance companies  endowments  foundations  and public and corporate pension funds 
amli believes that co investment partnerships create an opportunity to leverage amli s acquisition  development and management expertise and generate higher returns on its invested equity capital 
amli does not control the partnerships in which it co invests as amli shares decision making authority over all major decisions with various co investment partners  therefore  amli s investments in these partnerships are appropriately accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
as a result  almost half of amli s assets and related debt and all of amli s co investment partners equity are reported off balance sheet 
because amli has differentiated itself from other publicly owned multifamily residential reits in the manner and to the extent it conducts its business through partnerships with institutional investors  the following condensed combined financial information for amli and its partnerships at december   as shown below  is presented as supplementary information intended to provide a better understanding of amli s financial position

  amli conducts business through its co investment partnerships primarily to increase amli s return on invested capital as a result of fees and other compensation it earns and to expand amli s access to equity capital  otherwise  amli conducts business through its co investment partnerships in the same way it conducts the business of its wholly owned communities 
amli is compensated in a variety of ways for the services it provides to these co investment partnerships or amli s partners 
most of the accounting policies that are deemed to be critical accounting policies relate to accounting for this compensation 
compensation earned by the op generally includes acquisition fees  disposition fees  development fees  asset management fees  cash flow preferences  financing fees and promoted interests 
compensation earned by the service companies includes construction and property management fees 
in general  fees are recognized upon completion of the earnings process  regardless of the timing of the receipt of cash 
for instance  acquisition and disposition fees are recognized only upon completion of an acquisition or disposition of a community on behalf of a co investment partnership  and asset management and property management fees are recognized as they are earned as services are provided 
development and construction fees are recognized using the percentage of completion method eg  of total development fees are recognized when of total costs are incurred 
payment of a portion of development fees earned may  in some instances  be deferred until completion of development and lease up 
absent indications of inability to complete development or lease up  this payment deferral does not necessitate deferral of development fee income as recognized on the percentage of completion method 
a portion of any fees earned from a co investment partnership is eliminated to the extent of amli s ownership interest that is  amli does not recognize as income 
for instance  if amli earns a acquisition fee  which is earned from a partnership in which it holds a ownership interest  only in fee income is recognized 
because the co investment partnership has incurred of cost and capitalized this fee as part of its acquisition cost  amli s share of equity on the books of this partnership will exceed its investment in this partnership by the eliminated fees and the other differences are being taken into earnings over years as the underlying communities are depreciated 
any remaining unamortized fees are taken into income upon a community s disposition 
at december   details of the differences between amli s aggregate investment in partnerships and its aggregate share of equity as recorded on the books of these partnerships  net of amortization accumulated are as follows amli s share of equity in partnerships  negative investment balances presented in other liabilities  capitalized interest  eliminated fees  eliminated construction profits  other comprehensive loss  other  net  total investment in partnerships  amli capitalizes interest relating to its investments to the extent that qualified assets of each partnership those under development exceed debt of that partnership 
most of the  capitalized interest relates to amli s capital contributions which funded its share of the development costs of communities owned by unleveraged partnerships 
capitalized interest is being amortized against earnings over years 
promoted interests in most of the co investment partnerships  amli is entitled to an increased share of any cash distributions after amli and its co investment partner have received a stated return of or on their capital investment 
amli receives the promoted interests for having managed successful investments for its partners 
the promoted interest amounts are recognized in income when received in cash 
most of this additional distribution is recognized as income following the sale of the community and distribution of the proceeds  although receipt of cash and recognition of income can occur earlier and is typically included in income from partnerships 
accounting for investments in and transactions with the service companies each of the service companies is a trs established to provide services for fees  primarily to amli and its co investment partnerships 
through ownership of these subsidiaries  amli is able to participate in the costs and benefits of value added activities  which would be impermissible for a reit to undertake directly 
amli eliminates fee income generated by the service companies to the extent of amli s interest in the respective co investment partnerships 
capital needs of the service companies since amli s initial offering in have resulted primarily from working capital requirements associated with construction activities undertaken on behalf of amli and its co investment partnerships  information technology costs  especially in  to give amc the scalable systems needed to accommodate future growth  and costs of real estate acquired 
amc capitalizes costs of hardware and software acquired and installed  and also capitalizes internal costs associated with software development  and amortizes all such costs over five years 
some accounting judgment is required in the determination of the costs appropriate for capitalization and in the determination of the appropriateness of the period over which such costs are amortized 
total deferred information technology costs  net of accumulated amortization  were  at december  in conjunction with amli s land acquisition activities  amrescon has acquired land that is being held for sale 
in  amrescon also commenced participation in two joint ventures which are building multifamily developments intended for sale at or near completion 
community acquisition cost pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for business combinations  sfas  amli allocates a portion of the total acquisition cost of communities acquired to leases in existence as of the date of acquisition 
during amli allocated  of the total acquisition cost to existing leases  this amount is included in depreciable property in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  and is being amortized over the average remaining terms of the leases approximately twelve months and considerably less than the depreciable lives associated with all other acquisition costs 
amortization of  for this allocated cost was included in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended december  rental rates of all acquired leases approximate current market rent 
cost capitalization amli capitalizes costs associated with developing real estate and significant costs incurred to improve or replace components of completed communities 
details of costs capitalized and expensed are provided later in this discussion 
there is diversity in accounting policies adopted by the real estate industry 
amli is of the opinion that its policies are generally consistent with industry practice 
one exception is that amli expenses the cost of exterior painting of existing communities 
additional formal guidance regarding cost capitalization is anticipated to become effective after december  such new rules may  if and when adopted  cause certain capitalized real estate development related costs to be expensed 
value of land amli s inventory of land is carried at cost  but not in excess of fair value 
accounting judgment is required to value the land appropriately in instances in which cost may exceed fair value 
amli determined that certain land parcels  which amli had intended to develop  were worth less than their carrying value 
accordingly  amli recorded a and provision for loss on these land parcels in and  respectively 
results of community operations general at december   amli owned interests in stabilized communities containing  apartment homes and three communities in lease up containing  apartment homes 
stabilized communities are communities that are fully completed and have  in the opinion of management  completed their initial lease up 
thirty nine of the communities are wholly owned and their operating results are reflected in amli s consolidated statements of operations under rental operations as well as under income from discontinued operations 
thirty five are owned in partnerships  and amli s share of operating results are included in income from partnerships 
amli distinguishes between stabilized communities which include same store communities  communities acquired from contributed to partnerships  new communities and acquisition communities from development and lease up communities and communities sold  each of which are defined as follows 
same store communities communities that have had stabilized operations and were owned by amli as of january  
communities acquired from contributed to partnerships reflects operations of communities acquired from or contributed to partnerships for the periods presented 

new communities communities that were developed by amli and began stabilized operations after january  
acquisition communities communities having stabilized operations that were acquired by amli after january  
development and lease up communities communities being developed by amli that are not yet stabilized 

communities sold reflects operations through the date a community was sold 
community revenue comprises that portion of total revenue collected or due from leases of apartment homes and includes any such amounts as may be reported as discontinued operations 
community rental expenses comprise that portion of total expenses that include amounts reported as personnel  advertising and promotion  utilities  building repairs and maintenance and services  landscaping and grounds maintenance  real estate taxes  property management  and other expenses  and any such amounts as may be included in discontinued operations 
community rental expenses exclude losses from sales or valuation of land  expenses of the service companies  general and administrative expenses  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
amli uses noi to measure the operating results of its communities 
noi represents community revenue less community rental expenses 
noi is universally used in the industry in the valuation of income producing real estate  and as supplementary performance measure 
this performance measure is not intended as a replacement for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
wholly owned communities for the year ended december   noi from wholly owned communities increased slightly from the same period a year ago  which was primarily attributable to a increase in rental revenue

same store communities combined for purposes of this discussion and analysis  of the results of operations of amli s co investment communities is combined with the results of operations of amli s wholly owned communities 
as of december    apartment homes  or of total apartment homes in amli s stabilized communities  were categorized as same store communities  of which  apartment homes were wholly owned   were owned in partnerships and  apartment homes were previously co investment communities and became wholly owned during the two year period ending december  the following commentary is based primarily on an analysis of amli s same store portfolio since the operating results of stabilized communities owned over comparable periods generally provide a better perspective of market conditions affecting amli s portfolio 
rental revenue for the calendar year compared to the calendar year  rental revenue declined 
the change was attributable to a decline in collected rent per occupied unit  which was mostly offset by a increase in occupancy 
occupancy the following chart shows weighted average physical occupancy  calculated based on the average of each day s physical occupancy during the month  for all same store communities for each of amli s markets and for the amli portfolio in total daily weighted average physical occupancy same store communities quarter ended years ended dec dec dec dallas

occupied apartments exclude community models and apartments not in service due to fire  flood or otherwise 
the average occupancy for the quarter and year is based on simple average of the monthly occupancy 
in addition to physical occupancy as an indicator of market conditions  some in the apartment industry measure economic occupancy as well 
because the calculation of economic occupancy typically adjusts the value of vacancies and concessions among other items from quoted market rents  many believe that it is a better indicator of market fundamentals 
since there is no consistent industry measurement of economic occupancy and the calculation is derived from many variable data  amli prefers to measure total revenue earned per each occupied apartment home 
as amli s policy is to reserve as a bad debt any rent or other payments due from a resident that is more than days delinquent  revenue earned for purposes of this analysis is essentially equal to collected revenue per unit  another metric used by some in the apartment industry

years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities 




   net cash provided by used in investing activities 









   net cash provided by used in financing activities 









   the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to resulted primarily from higher rental revenue from a larger portfolio of wholly owned communities  offset in part by an increase in rental expenses and lower income from partnerships 
the change to net cash used in investing activities in from net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily due to the acquisition of our partners interests that amli did not already own in eight co investment partnerships  an acquisition of a rental community from a third party  and higher capital expenditures 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in investments in partnerships and a return of capital from partnerships from proceeds of permanent financing on two recently completed partnership developments 
the change to net cash provided by financing activities in from net cash used in financing activities in was primarily due to amli s higher borrowings to fund acquisitions and repayments of two mortgages on communities acquired 
during  amli closed on an equity offering of  shares of its common stock issued to the public at per share  which provided approximately  for amli s acquisition activities 
management is of the opinion that amli s current access to debt and equity capital is adequate to fund its near term growth objectives 
the achievement of amli s longer term growth objectives will be dependent upon future access to debt and equity capital  including co investment debt and equity  and amli s ability to sell communities 
amli most recently issued  common shares in a public offering which closed in august and anticipates funding its future acquisition and development activities by i raising public equity capital  ii raising additional equity from its co investment partners  and iii selectively selling communities  and selectively increasing indebtedness 
in  amli generated  of funds from operations ffo in excess of  dividends paid and  of capital expenditures 
amli is not committed to fund any acquisitions for which it does not have available capital  and amli s aggregate unfunded equity capital requirements  net of availability under construction loans and joint venture partners contributions  is  for all seven communities under development by the op and amrescon 
during amli formed one co investment partnership having total equity capital requirements totaling  of which amli s co investment partners contributed a total of  and amli sold five communities  including three owned by co investment partnerships  for aggregate net sales proceeds of  which generated net proceeds to amli of  substantially all of these proceeds were used to acquire interests in nine communities  eight of which were the acquisitions of the partnership interests amli did not already own in these communities 
during  amli closed on the permanent financing on four communities  including one wholly owned community 
amli received a total of  as a return of capital from proceeds of the partnership loans 
a mortgage loan secured by a partnership community was repaid from the proceeds of a loan from amli  prior to the sale of the community in august proceeds of the permanent financing on a completed development of a co investment community were used to repay the construction loan 
portions of four loans were also assumed by amli in connection with the acquisition of the partnership interests that amli did not already own in four co investment communities  two of the loans were repaid in december in addition  in february  amli prepaid  without penalty  mortgage loans encumbering two wholly owned communities that were maturing shortly 
amli has no liabilities  contingent or otherwise that management believes it cannot retire or fund in the ordinary course of business 
dividends and distributions amli has paid regular quarterly cash dividends since its formation in and expects to pay quarterly dividends from cash available for distribution and other cash on hand 
until distributed  funds available for distribution are used to temporarily reduce outstanding balances on amli s revolving lines of credit 
amli expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements by using its working capital and any portion of net cash flow from operations not distributed currently 
amli currently believes that its future net cash flows will be adequate to meet operating requirements and to provide for payment of dividends by amli in accordance with reit requirements 
amli believes it qualifies as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
a reit will generally not be subject to federal income taxation on that portion of its income that qualifies as reit taxable income to the extent that it distributes at least of its taxable income to its shareholders and complies with certain other requirements 
in  amli distributed of its taxable income  comprised of per share from and per share representing the portion of the distribution as a throwback dividend to in  amli distributed more than of its taxable income 
amli s current dividend payment level equals an annual rate of per common share 
all dividends paid in are fully taxable approximately as ordinary income and approximately as capital gain 
amli has recorded no deferred taxes on gains for financial reporting purposes that have been deferred for income tax reporting purposes because amli intends to distribute to its shareholders any deferred tax gain upon ultimate realization for income tax reporting purposes 
funds from operations ffo is defined as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of depreciable operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships  joint ventures and other affiliates 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships  joint ventures and other affiliates are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations  as defined by gaap  is not indicative that cash flows are adequate to fund all cash needs  and is not to be considered an alternative to net income or any other gaap measure as a measurement of the results of amli s operations or amli s cash flows or liquidity as defined by gaap 
ffo is widely accepted in measuring the performance of equity reits 
an understanding of amli s ffo will enhance the reader s comprehension of amli s results of operations and cash flows as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere herein

non cash impairment loss of  recorded as a charge against net income in the six month period ended june  had previously not been recorded as a charge against ffo 
as a result of recent guidance from the securities and exchange commission  ffo for the year ended december  has been revised to include this charge 
amli expects to meet certain long term liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and repayment of loans for construction  development and acquisition activities through the issuance of long term secured and unsecured debt and additional equity securities of amli or op units or through sales of assets 
as of december   amli had  that it may issue as common shares or preferred shares in the future under its shelf registration statement filed late in amli indebtedness amli seeks to maintain a relatively modest amount of leverage and measures its leverage and coverage ratios both including and excluding its share of off balance sheet debt 
at december   amli had  of debt outstanding and  outstanding  including its share of partnership debt 
debt to total market capitalization  excluding and including amli s share of partnership debt  was and  respectively 
a co investment community may be owned un levered or subject to indebtedness  depending upon the capital structure mutually agreed to by amli and its partner 
other than short term construction financing  all partnership debt will be non recourse  long term  fixed rate permanent mortgages 
at december  the character of amli s debt was as follows amli s debt  amli s including share debt of partnerships secured unsecured fixed variable variable rate debt includes amli s unsecured lines of credit and two secured tax exempt bond issues 
see the section on derivatives for a discussion of the hedges associated with the lines of credit 
amli s line of credit documents include leverage  coverage and other covenants typically found in line of credit agreements provided by commercial banks to publicly traded apartment reits 
amli monitors its compliance of the covenants and does not believe that it will breach any of them in the ordinary course of business 
a breach of a material financial covenant would normally result in the inability of amli to continue to have funds available under the line  until the default was remedied 
amli currently has an investment grade rating  baa  from moody s investor service moody s 
the primary purpose of the rating is to support lower pricing on amli s lines of credit 
amli believes that it is in its best interest to maintain an investment grade rating and will  over time  likely seek to obtain one or more from the other nationally recognized rating services 
the only impact of amli losing  or giving up  its investment grade rating  would be an increase in the loan spread on amli s lines of credit 
in general  moody s and amli s unsecured lenders place certain financial and operating constraints on amli  however  amli does not believe that they interfere  in any material way  with amli s ability to conduct its business 
amli believes that it does not need either unsecured debt availability or an investment grade rating to effectively conduct its business 
however  amli chooses to maintain and pursue both  in order to create as much flexibility in sourcing debt capital as is reasonably possible 
amli currently has excellent access to debt capital and believes that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future  absent a material disruption in the capital markets 
development activities at december   amli has made capital contributions totaling  to the co investment partnerships currently having development underway  and anticipates funding substantially all of its remaining  commitment net of its share of availability under construction loans and partner capital contributions of  to complete the  apartment homes being developed by the op and by amrescon 
amli owns land in ft 
worth  austin and houston  texas and kansas city  kansas  which is being held for the development of an additional  apartment homes  or for sale 
amli has made earnest money deposits for two land parcels located in kansas city  kansas 
amli has postponed active development planning for some of its land parcels in houston and forth worth  texas  until conditions in those particular submarkets are more favorable for development 
amli expensed costs associated with carrying these land parcels in and inflation inflation has been low for the past several years 
amli s apartment leases at its communities are typically for six or twelve months duration 
absent other market influences  this enables amli to reset rental rates relatively often  thereby passing along inflationary increases in its rental expenses on a timely basis 
because amli s community rental expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization are approximately of rental and other revenue  increased inflation typically results in comparable increases in income before interest and general and administrative expenses 
however  since the increases in costs and expenses combined with decreases in income resulted in decreased income before interest and general and administrative expenses 
an increase in general price levels may be accompanied by an increase in interest rates 
at december   amli s exposure to rising interest rates including amli s proportionate share of its partnerships interest expense was mitigated by the existing debt level of approximately of amli s total market capitalization including amli s share of partnerships debt  the higher percentage of intermediate term fixed rate debt of total debt  and the use of interest rate swaps and caps to effectively fix or limit the interest rate on  of floating rate borrowings through september  on  through october and on  through april of total debt

in january  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  fin  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies 
fin was revised in december the revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r is applicable for interim periods that end after march  fin r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
consolidated financial statements  and requires that vies in which a business enterprise has a majority variable interest be presented on a consolidated basis in its financial statements 
we do not believe the adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as land  buildings and improve ments and personal property  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated fair value  which is computed based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount of such excess 
assets to be disposed of would be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
amli has provided for losses on its land parcels held for future development or sale totaling  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  which losses are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
other contingencies amli has discovered that some of its communities primarily some of those located in texas have problems with mold caused by excessive moisture which accumulates in buildings or on building materials 
some molds are known to produce potent toxins or irritants 
concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold can cause a variety of health effects and symptoms in certain individuals  including severe allergic or other reactions 
as a result  the presence of mold at amli s communities could require undertaking a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected communities 
such a remediation program could necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the communities residents or the complete rehabilitation of the communities 
amli carries insurance to protect against this specific risk 
based on existing known facts  amli is unaware of any specific circumstance that could result in amli incurring any significant costs as a result of problems with mold 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk amli is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of amli s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
amli s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  amli borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
amli does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
since december   amli has reduced its exposure to risks associated with interest rate changes and has significantly extended the average maturities of its fixed rate debt portfolio by refinancing  in borrowings under its floating rate line of credit with a ten year secured fixed interest rate loan 
there have been no other significant changes in amli s exposure to market risks 
at december  variable rate debt net of  swapped to fixed rates totals  so that each increase in short term interest rates will increase amli s annual interest cost by  amli s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the following table presents amli s debt and estimated fair value at december  average market effective estimated value carrying interest fair interest amount rate value rate fixed rate debt

  the interest rate shown for the variable rate libor debt excludes the effect of amli s interest rate limitation contracts on  of the variable rate libor debt 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
moreover  because there were no firm commitments to actually sell these instruments at fair value at december   the information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value 
as a result  amli s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  amli s hedging strategies at that time  and future changes in the level of interest rates
