item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for customer sales information 
backlog backlog consists of contracts or purchase orders with delivery dates scheduled within the next months 
at august   our backlog was approximately billion  compared with backlog of approximately billion at august  because customers may cancel or reschedule deliveries  often with little or no financial penalty  backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future consolidated financial results 
competition the ems industry comprises many companies  several of which have substantial market share 
we also face competition from current and prospective customers that evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally 
we compete with different companies depending on the type of service or geographic area 
we believe the primary basis of competition in our targeted markets is proven execution  reliability  superior manufacturing technology  price  flexibility  continuity of supply  quality  responsiveness  innovative and value adding services and ability to serve global customers 
associates as of august   we employed approximately  associates worldwide  which includes approximately  temporary associates 
patents and trademarks we hold certain united states and foreign patents and patent licenses relating to certain of the processes and equipment used in our manufacturing technology  as well as certain of the products which we have designed and manufactured 
in addition  we have registered trademarks service marks in the united states and various other countries throughout the world 
although we do not believe that our trademarks  manufacturing processes  patents or license rights to which we have access infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  we cannot ensure that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
if such an assertion were to be made  it may become necessary or useful for us to enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve such an issue through litigation 
however  we cannot ensure that such license rights would be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or that any such litigation would be resolved favorably 
any litigation could be lengthy and costly and  regardless of its outcome  could materially harm our consolidated financial condition 
environmental matters we are required to comply with local  state  federal and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the treatment  storage  use  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing and service processes 
we are also required to comply with laws and regulations relating to occupational safety and health  product disposal and product content and labeling 
in general  we are not directly responsible for compliance with laws like waste electrical and electronic equipment weee and restriction of hazardous substances rohs 
these weee and rohs laws generally apply to our oem customers  solectron may  however  provide compliance related services to our customers upon request 
failing to have the capability of delivering products which comply with these present and future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand facilities  or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations  and could impair our relations with customers 
moreover  to the extent we are found non compliant with any environmental laws and regulations applicable to our activities  we may incur substantial fines and penalties 
we are committed to maintaining compliance in all of our facilities and to continuously improving our environmental practices 
we are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits for many of our facilities 
these permits  which must be renewed periodically  are subject to revocation if we violate environmental laws 
there can be no assurance that violations will not occur as a result of equipment failure  human error or other causes 
if a violation of environmental laws occurs  we could be held liable for damages  fines and costs of remedial actions  and our permits could be revoked 
any such revocation could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  and may adversely impact our results of operations 
we have been  and in the future may be  held liable for remediation of sites where our hazardous materials or those of companies we have acquired have been disposed of 
to date  these liabilities have not been substantial or material to our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we believe  based on our current knowledge  that the cost of any groundwater or soil clean up that may be required at any of our facilities would not materially harm our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
however  it is costly to remediate contamination  and there can be no assurance that any future remediation costs would not harm our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations

item legal proceedings solectron is from time to time involved in various litigation and legal matters  including those described below 
by describing the particular matters set forth below  solectron does not intend to imply that it or its legal advisors have concluded or believe that the outcome of any of those particular matters is or is not likely to have a material adverse impact upon solectron s business or consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the case entitled ronald sorisho v 
solectron corporation et al  case no 
cv  which has been previously reported  was resolved on terms not material to solectron and the case has been dismissed 
on march   a putative shareholder class action lawsuit was filed against solectron and certain of its officers in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging claims under section b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  and rule b promulgated thereunder 
the case is entitled abrams v 
solectron corporation et al  case no 
c crb 
the complaint alleged that the defendants issued false and misleading statements in certain press releases and sec filings issued between september  and september  in particular  plaintiff alleged that the defendants failed to disclose and to properly account for excess and obsolete inventory in the former technology solutions business unit during the relevant time period 
additional complaints making similar allegations were subsequently filed in the same court  and pursuant to an order entered june   the court appointed lead counsel and plaintiffs to represent the putative class in a single consolidated action 
the consolidated amended complaint  filed september   alleges an expanded class period of june  through september   and purports to add a claim for violation of section of the securities act of  as amended the securities act  on behalf of a putative class of former shareholders of c mac industries  inc  who acquired solectron stock pursuant to the october  registration statement filed in connection with solectron s acquisition of c mac industries  inc in addition  while the initial complaints focused on alleged inventory issues at the former technology solutions business unit  the consolidated amended complaint adds allegations of inadequate disclosure and failure to properly account for excess and obsolete inventory at solectron s other business units 
the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages on behalf of the putative class 
solectron believes the complaint to be without merit  and that it has valid defenses to the plaintiffs claims 
there can be no assurance  however  that the outcome of the lawsuit will be favorable to solectron or will not have a material adverse effect on solectron s business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations

overview we provide a range of worldwide manufacturing and integrated supply chain services to electronics companies 
our revenue is generated from sales of our services primarily to customers in the computing storage  networking  communications  consumer  industrial  and automotive markets 
sales to a relatively small number of customers historically have made up a significant portion of our net sales and we expect that trend to continue in the future 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for   and for fiscal   and  respectively 
currently  our largest customer  cisco systems  accounted for or more of our net sales for fiscal  and the ems industry experienced rapid change and growth over the past decade as an increasing number of oems outsourced an increasing portion of their manufacturing requirements 
in  the industry s revenue declined as a result of significant reduction in end market demand  which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we initiated the restructuring of our operations in light of the global economic downturn 
the measures  which included reducing the workforce  consolidating facilities and changing the strategic focus of a number of sites  were intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated customer demand  transition our operations to lower cost regions and rationalize our footprint worldwide 
additionally  we decided to divest selected business operations that are not central to our strategy 
these business operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations 
our revenues from continuing operations have increased over the last year as customer production requirements have risen during the economic recovery  and we are winning business with new and existing customers 
summary of results the following table sets forth  for the three year periods indicated  certain key operating results and other financial information in millions years ended august net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense income loss on discontinued operations net sales for fiscal increased to billion compared to billion for the fiscal our sales levels during fiscal year were stronger across all our primary markets 
the increase in net sales represents stronger demand from existing programs  as well as growth from new and existing customers 
net sales for fiscal decreased to billion compared to billion for fiscal the decrease in net sales was primarily the result of weakness in end markets for networking  communications and computing and storage particularly pc notebooks 
the weaknesses in these areas were partially offset by strength in our high end computing and storage  consumer  industrial and automotive markets 
gross profit improved to for fiscal compared to and for fiscal and  respectively 
the improvement in gross profit is primarily the result of the execution of our lean six sigma manufacturing initiative lean initiative  increased discipline in the implementation of our quote process  and improved capacity utilization 
the lean initiative has begun to give us improved flexibility  quality  and operational effectiveness and efficiency 
the lean initiative encompasses identifying value added activities  conducting these activities without interruption whenever a customer requests them  and performing them more effectively 
in general  the lean initiative in our manufacturing environment attempts to provide customers with what they require using more efficient human effort  equipment  time and space 
the increased discipline in the implementation of our quote process has involved centralizing the process  standardizing the cost models used to evaluate programs  raising decision making authority to more senior levels within the company  emphasizing the expected returns to solectron in deciding what pricing to offer and accept  and implementing profitability based sales force compensation 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense including research and development costs continued to decline in fiscal sg a expense was  and as a percentage of net sales for fiscal   and  respectively 
the reduction in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales  is a result of our restructuring activities  divestures and other cost reduction initiatives 
during fiscal  we completed the sale of six of our seven discontinued operations dy systems  inc  kavlico corporation  smart modular technologies  inc  stream international inc  our interest in us robotics corporation  and force computers  inc in addition  we entered into an agreement to sell the last discontinued operation  our microtechnology business  in the fourth quarter of fiscal on october  we completed the divesture of our microtechnology business operations 
total gross proceeds from the sale of all discontinued operations were approximately million 
we have made significant progress in reducing our outstanding debt during the year ended august  in fiscal  we completed the early settlement of approximately of our outstanding aces debentures and the cash settlement of million of our outstanding lyons 
these two actions decreased our outstanding debt by approximately billion and increased equity by approximately billion 
the net effect of reducing debt and increasing equity improved our debt to capital ratio from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal our short term debt is now million and our remaining long term debt of billion has an average maturity of years 
key performance indicators management regularly reviews the following financial performance indicators to assess the company s operating results 
the following table sets forth  for the quarterly periods indicated  certain of management s key financial performance indicators 
three months ended august  may  february  november  august  inventory turns turns turns turns turns turns days sales outstanding dso days days days days days days payable outstanding dpo days days days days days cash to cash cycle cc days days days days days capital expenditures in millions inventory turns is calculated as the ratio of cost of sales compared to the average inventory for the quarter 
the improvement in inventory turns during fiscal was primarily the result of our disciplined and focused effort on material and production planning and  continued implementation of the lean initiative in our manufacturing sites around the world 
dso is calculated as the ratio of average accounts receivable  net  for the quarter compared to daily net sales for the quarter 
dso has declined due to an increased focus on collection activity and ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions of our contracts 
dpo is calculated as the ratio of average accounts payable during the quarter compared to daily cost of sales for the quarter 
the cc cycle is determined by taking the ratio of days compared to inventory turns plus dso minus dpo 
the cc cycle has declined primarily as a result of improvements in both inventory turns and dso  partially offset by lower dpo 
capital expenditures are primarily related to equipment purchases supporting increased demand  new programs  and information technology projects 
critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported when we prepare consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  our accounting for contingencies  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  goodwill and intangible asset impairments  restructuring costs  and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand  as well as any other lower of cost or market considerations 
we make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are also impacted by our contractual arrangements with our customers including our ability or inability to re sell such inventory to them 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected or if our customers are unwilling or unable to comply with any contractual arrangements related to excess and obsolete inventory  additional provisions may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due to us and thereby reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is likely to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are outstanding  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter as of june 
additionally  we perform an impairment assessment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
significant changes in circumstances can be both internal to our strategic and financial direction  as well as changes to the competitive and economic landscape 
with the change in operating segments as of sept   we determined that there was a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment tests under sfas no 
for purposes of assessing the impairment of our goodwill  we estimate the value of the reporting unit using our market capitalization as the best evidence of fair value 
this fair value is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we then allocate the fair value of the unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit s fair value was the purchase price to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including future revenue forecasts  discount rates and various reporting unit allocations 
intangible assets our intangible assets consist primarily of intellectual property agreements and other intangible assets obtained from asset acquisitions 
intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is measured by comparing the intangible assets carrying amounts to the fair values as determined using discounted cash flow models 
there is significant judgment involved in determining these cash flows 
restructuring and related impairment costs over the past few years  we have recorded restructuring and impairment costs as we rationalized our operations in light of customer demand declines and the economic downturn 
these restructuring and impairment charges include employee severance and benefit costs  costs related to leased facilities that have been abandoned and subleased  owned facilities no longer used by us which will be disposed of  costs related to leased equipment that has been abandoned or returned to the lessor  and impairment of owned equipment that will be disposed of 
for owned facilities and equipment  the impairment loss recognized was based on the fair value less costs to sell  with fair value estimated based on existing market prices for similar assets 
severance and benefit costs and other costs associated with restructuring activities initiated prior to january  were recorded in compliance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
severance and benefit costs associated with restructuring activities initiated on or after january  are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postemployment benefits  as we concluded that we had a substantive severance plan 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  the estimated lease loss accrued for leased facilities that have been abandoned and subleased after january  represents the fair value of the lease liability as measured by the present value of future lease payments subsequent to abandonment less the present value of any estimated sublease income 
for those facilities abandoned and subleased as part of restructuring activities under eitf issue no 
 the estimated lease loss represents payments subsequent to abandonment less any estimated sublease income 
in order to estimate future sublease income  we work with a real estate broker to estimate the length of time until we can sublease a facility and the amount of rent we can expect to receive 
our estimates of expected sublease income could change based on factors that affect our ability to sublease those facilities such as general economic conditions and the real estate market  among others 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions resulting from tax credit carry forwards  net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences  which will reduce taxable income in such jurisdictions in future periods 
we have provided valuation allowances for future tax benefits resulting from foreign net operating loss carry forwards and for certain other us and foreign deductible temporary differences where we believe future realizability is in doubt 
sfas no 
requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  and further provides that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses in recent years 
therefore  cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
we established a valuation allowance in the third quarter of fiscal for most of our deferred tax assets because prior losses and an uncertain future outlook did not support projections of profitability sufficient to establish our ability to use those deferred tax assets in future periods 
we have not yet established sustained profitability since that time which would support recognition of deferred tax assets generated in prior and current periods 
as a result of our assessment  we increased our total valuation allowance on deferred tax assets arising from continuing operations to approximately billion at august  we expect to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we reach a sustained level of profitability in the countries in which deferred tax assets arise 
we have established contingency reserves for income taxes in various jurisdictions in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
the estimate of appropriate tax reserves is based upon the amount of prior tax benefit which might be at risk upon audit and upon the reasonable estimate of the amount at risk 
we periodically reassesses the amount of such reserves and adjusts reserve balances as necessary 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business for example  environmental and legal matters 
we consider the likelihood and our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining the necessity for  and amount of  any loss contingencies 
estimated loss contingencies are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether any such accruals should be adjusted 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential loss contingencies could have a material impact in our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
results of operations for fiscal years  and the following table summarizes certain items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 
the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the discussion following the table is provided separately for continuing and discontinued operations 
in fiscal and  certain operations we planned to divest qualified for discontinued operations classification 
accordingly  our consolidated statements of operations include these results in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
information related to the discontinued operations results is provided separately following the continuing operations discussion 
years ended august net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative restructuring and impairment costs goodwill impairment operating loss interest income interest expense other expense income net operating loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit loss from continuing operations discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations income tax expense benefit income loss on discontinued operations net loss net sales continuing operations for the year ended august   net sales increased to billion from billion in fiscal the increase was due to increased sales levels across all primary markets 
specific increases include a increase in the sale of computing and storage products  a increase in the sale of networking products  a increase in the sale of communication products  a increase in sales of consumer products  a increase in the sale of industrial products  and a increase in the sale of automotive products 
the increased sales levels were due to stronger demand from existing programs  as well as growth from our new and existing customers 
the consumer product market represented our largest dollar increase in revenue year over year at approximately million 
this increase in the consumer market was driven by demand for handheld devices  cellular handsets and set top boxes in fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal primarily resulted from weakness in end markets for networking  communications and computing and storage particularly pc notebooks 
the weaknesses in these areas were partially offset by strength in our high end computing and storage  consumer  industrial and automotive markets 
the following table depicts  for the periods indicated  revenue by market expressed as a percentage of net sales 
the distribution of revenue across our markets has fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of numerous factors  including but not limited to increased business from new and existing customers  fluctuations in customer demand  seasonality  and growth in market outsourcing 
years ended august computing storage networking consumer communications industrial automotive other total international sales international locations contributed of consolidated net sales in fiscal  compared with in fiscal and in fiscal net sales from our international sites have grown primarily in the asia region where we have invested to take advantage of the lower cost of operations 
net sales are attributable to the country in which the product is manufactured 
major customers net sales to major customers as a percentage of net sales were as follows years ended august cisco systems nortel networks less than our top ten customers accounted for of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal we cannot guarantee that these or any other customers will not increase or decrease as a percentage of consolidated net sales either individually or as a group 
consequently  any material decrease in sales to these or other customers could materially harm our consolidated results of operations 
we believe that our ability to grow depends on increasing sales to existing customers and on successfully attracting new customers 
customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of delayed  canceled or reduced orders with new business cannot be ensured 
in addition  we cannot assume that any of our current customers will continue to utilize our services 
consequently  our consolidated results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
gross profit continuing operations gross profit varies from period to period and is affected by a number of factors  including product mix  production efficiencies  component costs and delivery linearity  product life cycles  unit volumes  expansion and consolidation of manufacturing facilities  utilization of manufacturing capacity  pricing  competition  and unanticipated inventory charges 
our gross profit percentages were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit percentage from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to effectively implementing the lean initiative in our manufacturing sites around the world  increasing discipline in the implementation of our quote process and improving capacity utilization 
the decrease in gross profit percentage from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to continued inefficiencies associated with reduced demand  pricing pressure within our industry  and the transition of production capacity from higher cost to lower cost regions 
we continue to implement a number of initiatives to improve our gross profit lean initiative to improve flexibility  quality  and operational effectiveness and efficiency  further improving capacity utilization  ensuring contractual relationships reflect value added by our operations  a disciplined pricing model  engaging with our customers in collaborative design  and profitability based sales force compensation 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million related to excess and obsolete inventory 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory 
both charges were the result of the depressed condition in the telecommunications market 
in the foreseeable future  our overall gross profit will depend primarily on several factors  including but not limited to  product mix  production efficiencies  utilization of manufacturing capacity  pricing within the electronics industry  and component costs 
over time  gross profit may continue to fluctuate 
sales of inventory previously written down or written off have not been significant and have not had any material impact on our gross profit to date 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses continuing operations sg a expenses decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal sg a expenses decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses decreased to in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal in fiscal  the functional alignment of the organization and resulting sg a cost reduction initiatives drove the improvement 
furthermore  headcount reductions and other sg a expense reductions including depreciation expense resulting from our restructuring initiatives and divestures also contributed to the decrease over the past three fiscal years 
restructuring and impairment costs continuing operations in recent years  we have initiated a series of restructuring measures in light of the economic downturn 
the measures  which included reducing the workforce  and consolidating facilities  have been intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated customer demand and transition our operations to lower cost regions 
this has enhanced our ability to provide cost effective manufacturing service offerings  which enables us to retain and expand our existing relationships with customers and attract new business 
we have recognized restructuring costs of million  million and million excluding goodwill and intangible asset impairments during fiscal  and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we committed to a plan to incur approximately million in new restructuring charges 
these restructuring actions are to further consolidate facilities  reduce the workforce in europe and north america and impair certain long lived assets 
these restructuring actions will result in future savings in salaries and benefits and depreciation expense that would impact cost of goods sold and sg a expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
of the million in planned restructuring charges  approximately million relates to severance charges  million relates to the impairment of certain long lived assets and the remaining amount relates to program transfer costs 
we expect to complete these new restructuring actions by the end of fiscal excluding the new activity noted above  restructuring costs over the past three fiscal years includes the elimination of approximately  full time positions primarily in the americas and europe regions 
in addition  these charges relate to the closure and consolidation of facilities and impairment of certain long lived assets 
these restructuring activities are substantially complete as of august  however  we expect to incur nominal restructuring charges which will consist of both cash and non cash charges during the next fiscal year as we continue to sell the restructured long lived assets and revise previous estimates 
revisions to estimates will primarily be due to changes in assumptions used for the facility lease loss accrual 
while we believe our capacity is appropriate for current revenue levels  we continue to evaluate our cost structure relative to future financial results and customer demand 
if our estimates about future financial results and customer demand prove to be inadequate  our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations may suffer 
see note  restructuring  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our restructuring activities 
in addition to restructuring charges incurred  we have also impaired certain intangible assets over the past three fiscal years 
as a result of impairment tests performed during fiscal years   and  we recorded approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in non cash impairment charges 
for fiscal  the intangible impairment charges were the result of our disengagement from certain product lines 
for fiscal and  the intangible impairment charges were the result of reduced expectations of sales to be realized under certain supply agreements 
goodwill impairment continuing operations there was no goodwill impairment in fiscal goodwill impairment was approximately billion and billion for fiscal and  respectively  primarily as a result of significant negative industry and economic trends that affected our operations as well as a significant decline in our stock price 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest income continuing operations interest income decreased million to million for fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decreases were due to reduced average cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances and lower average interest rates 
interest expense continuing operations interest expense decreased million to million for fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense during fiscal was primarily due to the retirement of approximately billion aggregate principal amount at maturity of our liquid yield option tm notes lyons and the early settlement of approximately of our outstanding adjustable conversion rate equity security units aces debentures during the third quarter of fiscal the decrease in interest expense during fiscal was primarily due to the retirement of approximately billion aggregate principal amount at maturity of our lyons during the past two fiscal years 
this decrease was partially offset by the issuance in fiscal of our and senior notes due in the second quarter of fiscal for gross proceeds of approximately billion that bear interest at higher rates than the lyons 
tm trademark of merrill lynch co  inc other expense income net continuing operations other expense income net for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  other expense income net primarily consisted of a loss resulting from the early settlement of approximately of our aces debentures of million and a million loss resulting from the sale of our minority interest in ecs holdings limited 
other expense income net primarily consists of gains on retirement of our lyons in fiscal and fiscal the remaining components of other expense income net fluctuate primarily due to foreign currency gains and losses and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
the following tables provide the details of the early settlement of our aces debentures  the retirement of our lyons due  the retirement of our lyons due and the retirement of our lyons due in each period presented recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in millions years ended august aces early settlement principal amount at maturity carrying value common stock issued cash paid write off of debt issuance costs loss included in other expense income net years ended august lyons retirement principal amount at maturity carrying value cash paid and payable gain included in other expense income net see basis of presentation and recent accounting pronouncements  of note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  for further discussion of other expense income net 
income taxes continuing operations our income tax benefit was million in fiscal we recorded income tax expense of million in fiscal and a benefit of million in fiscal during fiscal  management determined that a valuation allowance was required with respect to deferred tax assets  which resulted in the tax expense incurred during the period 
the benefit in fiscal was primarily the result of losses incurred in those periods 
our effective income tax benefit rate for continuing operations was approximately in fiscal in prior years  the effective income tax rate had been largely a function of the balance between income and losses from domestic and international operations 
our international operations  taken as a whole  have been subject to tax at a lower rate than operations in the united states  primarily due to tax holidays granted to several of our overseas sites in malaysia  singapore and china 
the malaysian tax holiday is effective through january  subject to certain conditions  including maintaining certain levels of research and development expenditures 
the singapore tax holiday is effective through march  subject to certain conditions 
several of our china sites have separate tax holiday agreements 
certain of our offshore operations are reporting taxable profits  mostly arising in low cost locations 
accordingly  we are recognizing some tax expense related to those operations 
we will not be able to offset this tax expense with unrecognized deferred tax assets described above  because  for the most part  those assets did not arise in the jurisdictions where we are realizing taxable profits 
liquidity and capital resources continuing operations cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased to approximately billion at august  from approximately billion at august  the table below  for the periods indicated  provides selected consolidated cash flow information in millions years ended august net cash used in provided by operating activities of continuing operations net cash provided by used in investing activities of continuing operations net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations we used cash from operating activities of million during fiscal year this use of cash was the result of a million loss from continuing operations  a million increase in accounts receivable  net  a million increase in inventories offset by a million increase in accounts payable  non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million  non cash impairment charge for property  equipment and intangible assets of million and loss on the retirement of debt of million 
the rise in inventory levels and accounts payable is due to an increase in forecasted demand from our customers 
accounts receivable  net  has increased in conjunction with higher net sales 
we generated cash from investing activities of million during fiscal year primarily due to net proceeds of million received from the disposition of six of our discontinued operations 
we used cash from financing activities of million during fiscal year primarily due to the payment to retire lyons for million offset by million of net proceeds generated from the issuance of convertible senior notes and million of net proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock 
as of august   we had available a million revolving credit facility that expires on august  this revolving credit facility was secured in august it amends and updates the previous million credit facility 
our revolving credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and secured by the pledge of domestic accounts receivable  inventory and equipment  the pledge of equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries and notes evidencing intercompany debt 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at the london interbank offering rate libor plus a margin of based on our current senior secured debt ratings  or the higher of the federal funds rate plus of or bank of america na s publicly announced prime rate 
as of august   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
we are subject to compliance with certain financial covenants set forth in these facilities including  but not limited to  capital expenditures  cash interest coverage and leverage 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of august  on october  standard and poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to b with a stable outlook 
on october  moody s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to b with a stable outlook 
these rating downgrades increase our cost of capital should we borrow under our revolving lines of credit  and may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future 
such capital raising activities may be on terms that may not be acceptable to us or otherwise not available 
on june   standard and poor s affirmed our senior unsecured rating and revised our outlook to positive from stable 
in addition  we had million in committed and million in uncommitted foreign lines of credit and other bank facilities as of august  relating to continuing operations 
a committed line of credit obligates a lender to loan us amounts under the credit facility as long as we adhere to the terms of the credit agreement 
an uncommitted line of credit is extended to us at the sole discretion of a lender 
the interest rates range from the bank s prime lending rate to the bank s prime rate plus 
as of august   borrowings and guaranteed amounts were million under committed and million under uncommitted foreign lines of credit 
borrowings are payable on demand 
the weighted average interest rate was for committed and for uncommitted foreign lines of credit as of august  during fiscal  we issued million shares of common stock for total net proceeds of million 
these net proceeds of million in part  along with an additional common stock issuance of million shares were used to early settle approximately of our aces 
as of august   million of the aces debentures remained outstanding 
on august   the remaining aces debentures were remarketed and the interest rate was reset at 
the proceeds from the remarketing will be used to satisfy the holders obligation to purchase solectron s common stock in november the aces debentures are due on november  holders of our lyons due november had the option to require us to repurchase their notes on may  in an amount of per  principal amount for a total of approximately million 
solectron repurchased million lyons for approximately million in cash during the third quarter of fiscal in addition  our million aggregate principal amount of senior notes is due on march   our million aggregate principal amount of senior notes is due on february   and our million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes is due on february  we have synthetic lease agreements relating to four manufacturing sites 
the synthetic leases have expiration dates in august at the end of the lease term  we have an option  subject to certain conditions  to purchase or to cause a third party to purchase the facilities subject to the synthetic leases for the termination value  which approximates the lessor s original cost for each facility  or we may market the property to a third party at a different price 
we are entitled to any proceeds from a sale of the properties to third parties in excess of the termination value and liable to the lessor for any shortfall not to exceed of the termination value 
we provided loans to the lessor equaling approximately of the termination value for each synthetic lease 
these loans are repayable solely from the sale of the properties to third parties in the future  are subordinated to the amounts payable to the lessor at the end of the synthetic leases  and may be credited against the termination value payable if we purchase the properties 
the approximate aggregate termination values and loan amounts are million and million  respectively  as of august  in addition  cash collateral of million is pledged for the difference between the aggregate termination values and the loan amounts 
each synthetic lease agreement contains various affirmative and financial covenants 
a default under a lease  including violation of these covenants  may accelerate the termination date of the arrangement 
effective august   we amended our cash interest coverage and leverage covenants  and eliminated its minimum cash  minimum tangible net worth  and minimum liquidity covenants 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of august  monthly lease payments are generally based on the termination value and day libor index as of august  plus an interest rate margin  which may vary depending upon our moody s investors services and standard and poor s ratings  and are allocated between the lessor and us based on the proportion of the loan amount to the termination value for each synthetic lease 
we account for these synthetic lease arrangements as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended 
our loans to the lessor and cash collateral were included in other long term assets and cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  respectively  in the consolidated balance sheets 
solectron has determined that it is probable that the expected fair value of the properties at the end of each of the various synthetic lease terms will be less than the applicable termination value  and the expected shortfall of million is being recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining lease term  beginning june  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  lines of credit and cash anticipated to be generated from continuing operations and divestitures of our discontinued operation will satisfy our expected working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and investment requirements through at least the next months

a tabular presentation of our contractual obligations is provided in the liquidity and capital resources portion of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
discontinued operations during fiscal and fiscal  as a result of a full review of our portfolio of businesses  we committed to a plan to divest a number of business operations that are no longer part of our strategic plan for the future 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have reported the results of operations and financial position of these businesses in discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets for all periods presented 
the companies that we have divested and are in the process of divesting and that are included in discontinued operations are dy systems inc  kavlico corporation  solectron s microtechnology division  smart modular technologies inc  stream international inc  our interest in us robotics corporation  and force computers  inc the collective results from all discontinued operations for all periods presented were as follows in millions years ended august net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses net operating income loss interest income net other expense income net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss on discontinued operations  net of tax fiscal net sales  gross profit  operating expenses net  and interest income net from discontinued operations decreased for the year ended august  as compared to the same period in fiscal due to the sale of six discontinued operations during fiscal in addition  the aggregate pre tax gain from the sale of all six discontinued operations of million was recorded in operating expenses net for fiscal in addition  we recorded million in operating expenses net in restructuring and impairment costs including goodwill in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the sales agreements for all six divestitures contain certain indemnification provisions under which solectron may be required to indemnify the buyer of the divested business for liabilities  losses  or expenses arising out of breaches of covenants and certain breaches of representations and warranties relating to the condition of the business prior to and at the time of sale 
in aggregate  solectron is generally contingently liable for up to million for a period of to months subsequent to the completion of the sale 
as of august   there were no liabilities recorded under these indemnification obligations 
fiscal sales and gross profit increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to fiscal including a full year of operations for all the discontinued operations while fiscal included partial results as four of our seven discontinued operations were acquired in fiscal operating expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to a million in restructuring and impairment costs including goodwill recorded during fiscal relating to the discontinued operations 
income tax expense increased significantly in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to approximately million charge recorded to establish valuation allowances against deferred tax assets related to the discontinued operations

on september   we completed the sale of our minority interest in ecs holdings limited ecs for approximately million in cash 
on october   we completed the divesture of our microtechnology business operations to francisco partners 
risk factors most of our net sales come from a small number of customers  if we lose any of these customers  our net sales could decline significantly 
most of our annual net sales come from a small number of our customers 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately   and of net sales from continuing operations in fiscal years   and  respectively 
one of these customers individually accounts for more than ten percent of our annual net sales 
any material delay  cancellation or reduction of orders from these or other major customers could cause our net sales to decline significantly  and we may not be able to reduce the accompanying expenses at the same time 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain any of our largest customers or any other accounts  or that we will be able to realize the expected revenues under existing or anticipated supply agreements with these customers 
our business  market share  consolidated financial condition and results of operations will continue to depend significantly on our ability to obtain orders from new customers  retain existing customers  realize expected revenues under existing and anticipated supply agreements  as well as on the consolidated financial condition and success of our customers and their customers 
net sales may not improve  and could decline  in future periods if there is continued or resumed weakness in customer demand  particularly in the telecommunications and computing sectors  resulting from worldwide economic conditions 
in addition  in connection with our efforts to improve our gross profits  we are engaged in pricing discussions with certain current customers on specific programs where we feel we are presently under compensated for the services and value that we provide 
where we are not able to reach mutual agreement with a customer on price adjustments  we have mutually agreed with the customer to transition the business in question to a new supplier 
while we believe our disengagement from specific programs with certain customers will ultimately advance our efforts to return to sustained profitability  there can be no assurance that such disengagements will not result in a loss of significant revenue  a lowering of our capacity utilization at affected sites  and other adverse financial effects 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or locations  or delay production 
to remain competitive  ems companies must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround  at increasingly competitive prices  for their customers 
we generally do not have long term contractual commitments from our top customers 
as a result  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to receive any net sales from our customers 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons outside of our control 
many of our customers industries have recently experienced a significant decrease in demand for their products and services  as well as substantial price competition 
the generally uncertain economic condition of several of our customers industries has resulted  and may continue to result  in some of our customers delaying purchases on some of the products we manufacture for them  and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated 
cancellations  reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers would seriously harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products manufactured by us for the customers and delivered in that period 
furthermore  delays in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and lower asset utilization in those periods would result in lower gross profits 
in addition  customers may require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to achieve cost and other objectives 
such transfers  if unanticipated or not properly executed  could result in various inefficiencies and costs  including excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and related strains on our resources at the other  disruption and delays in product deliveries and sales  deterioration in product quality and customer satisfaction  and increased manufacturing and scrap costs 
we may not be able to sell excess or obsolete inventory to customers or third parties  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition 
the majority of our inventory purchases and commitments are based upon demand forecasts that our customers provide to us 
the customers forecasts  and any changes to the forecasts  including cancellations  may lead to on hand inventory quantities and on order purchase commitments that are in excess of the customers revised needs  or that become obsolete 
we generally enter into supply agreements with our significant customers 
under these supply agreements  the extent of our customer s responsibility for excess or obsolete inventory related to raw materials that were previously purchased or ordered to meet that customer s demand forecast is defined 
if our customers do not comply with their contractual obligations to purchase excess or obsolete inventory back from us and we are unable to use or sell such inventory  our consolidated financial condition could be materially harmed 
some of our customers are in the telecommunications industry  an industry that in recent years has experienced declining revenue  large losses  negative cash flows  and several bankruptcies or defaults on borrowing arrangements 
in the past  some of our customers have defaulted on their obligations to purchase inventory back from us 
there is a risk that  in the future  these or other customers may not purchase inventory back from us despite contractual obligations  which could harm our consolidated financial condition if we are unable to sell the inventory at carrying value 
in addition  enforcement of these supply agreements may result in material expenses  delays in payment for inventory and or disruptions in our customer relationships 
we are responsible for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from inventory purchases in excess of inventory needed to meet customer demand forecasts at the time the purchase commitments were made  as well as any inventory purchases not made pursuant to the customer s responsibility under our supply agreements 
for inventory which is not the customer s responsibility  provisions are made when required to reduce any such excess or obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value  based on the quantity of such inventory on hand  our customers latest forecasts of production requirements  and our assessment of available disposition alternatives such as use of components on other programs  the ability and cost to return components to the vendor  and our estimates of resale values and opportunities 
these assessments are necessarily based upon various assumptions and market conditions which are subject to rapid change  and or which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate 
any material changes in our assumptions or market conditions could have a significant effect on our estimates of net realizable value  could necessitate material changes in our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition 
in addition  in the normal course of business  bona fide disagreements may arise over the amount and or timing of such claims  and in order to avoid litigation expenses  collection risks  or disruption of customer relationships  we may elect to settle such disputes for lesser amounts than we believe we should be entitled to recover 
in these instances  we must bear the economic loss of any such excess or obsolete inventory  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition 
for example  we recorded a charge of million related to excess and obsolete inventory during the second quarter of fiscal  and there can be no assurance that similar charges at lesser or greater levels will not be necessary in future periods 
our non us locations represent a significant portion of our net sales  we are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally 
approximately   and of our net sales from continuing operations are the result of services and products manufactured in countries outside the united states during fiscal   and  respectively 
as a result of our foreign sales and facilities  our operations are subject to a variety of risks and costs that are unique to international operations  including the following adverse movement of foreign currencies against the us dollar in which our results are reported  import and export duties  and value added taxes  import and export regulation changes that could erode our profit margins or restrict exports and or imports  potential restrictions on the transfer of funds  government and license requirements governing the transfer of technology and products abroad  disruption of local labor supply and or transportation services  inflexible employee contracts in the event of business downturns  the burden and cost of compliance with import and export regulations and foreign laws  economic and political risks in emerging or developing economies  and risks of conflict and terrorism that could disrupt our or our customers and suppliers businesses 
we have been granted tax holidays  which are effective through subject to some conditions  for our malaysian and singapore sites 
we have also been granted various tax holidays in china 
these tax holidays are effective for various terms and are subject to some conditions 
it is possible that the current tax holidays will be terminated or modified or that future tax holidays that we may seek will not be granted 
if the current tax holidays are terminated or modified  or if additional tax holidays are not granted in the future or when our current tax holidays expire  our future effective income tax rate could increase 
we are exposed to general economic conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and consolidated financial condition 
as a result of the recent economic conditions in the us and internationally  and reduced capital spending as well as uncertain end market demand  our customers and therefore our sales have been difficult to forecast with accuracy 
if there were to be continued or resumed weakness in these industries which we serve  or any further deterioration in the business or financial condition of our customers  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and consolidated financial condition 
in addition  if the economic conditions in the united states and the other markets we serve worsen  we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and consolidated financial condition 
possible fluctuation of operating results from quarter to quarter and factors out of our control could affect the market price of our securities 
our quarterly earnings and or stock price may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors including the following differences in the profitability of the types of manufacturing services we provide 
for example  high velocity and low complexity printed circuit boards and systems assembly services have lower gross profit than low volume complex printed circuit boards and systems assembly services  our ability to maximize the hours of use of our equipment and facilities is dependent on the duration of the production run time for each job and customer  the amount of automation that we can use in the manufacturing process for cost reduction varies  depending upon the complexity of the product being made  our customers demand for our products and their ability to take delivery of our products and to make timely payments for delivered products  our ability to optimize the ordering of inventory as to timing and amount to avoid holding inventory in excess of immediate production needs  our ability to offer technologically advanced  cost effective  quick response  manufacturing services  fluctuations in the availability and pricing of components  timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  cyclicality in our target markets  fluctuations in our market share  expenses and disruptions associated with acquisitions and divestitures  announcements of operating results and business conditions by our customers  announcements by our competitors relating to new customers or technological innovation or new services  economic developments in the electronics industry as a whole  credit rating and stock analyst downgrades  political and economic developments in countries in which we have operations  and general market conditions 
if our operating results in the future are below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our outstanding securities could be harmed 
if we incur more restructuring related charges than currently anticipated  our consolidated financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
if our estimates about previous restructuring charges prove to be inadequate  our consolidated financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
while we believe our capacity is appropriate for current revenue levels  we continue to evaluate our cost structure relative to future financial results and customer demand 
if our estimates about future financial results and customer demand prove to be inadequate  our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations may suffer 
we depend on limited or sole source suppliers for critical components 
the inability to obtain sufficient components as required  and under favorable purchase terms  would cause harm to our business 
we are dependent on certain suppliers  including limited and sole source suppliers  to provide key components used in our products 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  delays in component deliveries  which in turn could cause delays in product shipments and require the redesign of certain products 
in addition  if we are unable to procure necessary components under favorable purchase terms  including at favorable prices and with the order lead times needed for the efficient and profitable operation of our factories  our results of operations could suffer 
the electronics industry has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  shortages in semiconductor devices  including application specific integrated circuits  dram  sram  flash memory  certain passive devices such as tantalum capacitors  and other commodities that may be caused by such conditions as overall market demand surges or supplier production capacity constraints 
the inability to continue to obtain sufficient components as and when required  or to develop alternative sources as and when required  could cause delays  disruptions or reductions in product shipments or require product redesigns which could damage relationships with current or prospective customers  and increase inventory levels and costs  thereby causing harm to our business 
we potentially bear the risk of price increases associated with shortages in electronics components 
at various times  there have been shortages of components in the electronics industry leading to increased component prices 
one of the services that we perform for many customers is purchasing electronics components used in the manufacturing of the customers products 
as a result of this service  we potentially bear the risk of price increases for these components if we are unable to purchase components at the pricing level anticipated to support the margins assumed in our agreements with our customers 
our net sales could decline if our competitors provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at a lower cost 
we compete with different contract manufacturers  depending on the type of service we provide or the geographic locale of our operations  in an industry which is intensely competitive 
these competitors may have greater manufacturing  financial  r d and or marketing resources than we have 
in addition  we may not be able to offer prices as low as some of our competitors because those competitors may have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide  or because such competitors are willing to accept business at lower margins in order to utilize more of their excess capacity 
in that event  our net sales could decline 
we also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services  to reduce their current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater value added performance and improved pricing 
any of these could cause a decline in sales  loss of market acceptance of our products or services and corresponding loss of market share  or profit margin compression 
we have experienced instances in which customers have transferred certain portions of their business to competitors in response to more attractive pricing quotations than we have been willing to offer  and there can be no assurance that we will not lose business in the future in response to such competitive pricing or other inducements which may be offered by our competitors 
we depend on the continuing trend of oems to outsource 
a substantial factor in our past revenue growth was attributable to the transfer of manufacturing and supply based management activities from our oem customers 
future growth is partially dependent on new outsourcing opportunities 
to the extent that these opportunities are not available  our future growth would be unfavorably impacted 
our strategic relationships with major customers create risks 
in the past several years  we completed several strategic transactions with oem customers 
under these arrangements  we generally acquired inventory  equipment and other assets from the oem  and leased or in some cases acquired their manufacturing facilities  while simultaneously entering into multi year supply agreements for the production of their products 
there has been strong competition among ems companies for these transactions  and this competition may continue to be a factor in customers selection of their ems providers 
these transactions contributed to a significant portion of our past revenue growth  as well as to a significant portion of our more recent restructuring charges and goodwill and intangible asset impairments 
while we do not anticipate our acquisitions of oem plants and equipment in the near future to return to the levels at which they occurred in the recent past  there may be occasions on which we determine it to be advantageous to complete acquisitions in selected geographic and or industry markets 
as part of such arrangements  we would typically enter into supply agreements with the divesting oems  but such agreements generally do not require any minimum volumes of purchases by the oem and the actual volume of purchases may be less than anticipated 
arrangements which may be entered into with divesting oems typically would involve many risks  including the following we may pay a purchase price to the divesting oems that exceeds the value we are ultimately able to realize from the future business of the oem  the integration into our business of the acquired assets and facilities may be time consuming and costly  we  rather than the divesting oem  would bear the risk of excess capacity  we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies  we may be unable to meet the expectations of the oem as to volume  product quality  timeliness and cost reductions  and if demand for the oem s products declines  the oem may reduce its volume of purchases  and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other oems  and we might find it appropriate to close  rather than continue to operate  the facility  and any such actions would require us to incur significant restructuring and or impairment charges 
as a result of these and other risks  we may be unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under such arrangements and they may not result in material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings 
additionally  other oems may not wish to obtain logistics or operations management services from us 
if we are unable to manage future acquisitions  and cost effectively run our operations  our profitability could be adversely affected 
our ability to manage and integrate future acquisitions will require successful integration of such acquisitions into our manufacturing and logistics infrastructure  and may require enhancements or upgrades of accounting and other internal management systems and the implementation of a variety of procedures and controls 
we cannot guarantee that significant problems in these areas will not occur 
any failure to enhance or expand these systems and implement such procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with our business activities could harm our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may experience inefficiencies from the management of geographically dispersed facilities and incur substantial infrastructure and working capital costs 
we incurred approximately million including intangible impairment charges of approximately million of restructuring and impairment costs relating to continuing operations in fiscal and approximately billion including goodwill and other intangible impairment charges of approximately billion during fiscal see also the risk factor entitled if we incur more restructuring related charges than currently anticipated  our consolidated financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
notwithstanding our divestiture of certain businesses  we will remain subject to certain indemnification obligations for a period of time after completion of the divestitures 
the sale agreement for each of our divested businesses contains indemnification provisions under which we may be required to indemnify the buyer of the divested business for liabilities  losses  or expenses arising out of breaches of covenants and certain breaches of representations and warranties relating to the condition of the business prior to and at the time of sale 
while we believe  based upon the facts presently known to us  that we have made adequate provision for any such potential indemnification obligations  it is possible that other facts may become known in the future which may subject us to claims for additional liabilities or expenses beyond those presently anticipated and provided for 
should any such unexpected liabilities or expenses be of a material amount  our finances could be adversely affected 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our sites 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the currency of the exposure and the functional currency of our sites could seriously harm our business  operating results and consolidated financial condition 
for example  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  and if we price our products and services in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products and services in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts intended to reduce the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on foreign currency cash  receivables  investments and payables 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts are intended to offset the transaction gains and losses on the foreign currency cash  receivables  investments  and payables recognized in earnings 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative purposes 
our foreign exchange forward contracts related to current assets and liabilities are generally three months or less in original maturity 
as of august   we had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts with a total notional amount of approximately million related to continuing operations 
the change in value of the foreign exchange forward contracts resulting from a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates would be offset by the remeasurement of the related balance sheet items  the result of which would not be significant 
as of august   the majority of our foreign currency hedging contracts were scheduled to mature in approximately three months and there were no material deferred gains or losses 
in addition  our international operations in some instances act as a natural hedge because both operating expenses and a portion of sales are denominated in local currency 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower sales when translated to us dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
although approximately of our net sales from continuing operations in fiscal were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  we do not believe our total exposure to be significant because of natural hedges 
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
as of august   substantially our entire total portfolio was scheduled to mature in less than three months 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolios 
as of august   we had no cash equivalents and short term investments that were subject to interest rate risk defined as risk of loss of investment fair value due to interest rate movements 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and short term investments approximated the carrying value as of august  interest on long term debt instruments is payable at fixed rates 
in addition  the amount of principal to be repaid at maturity is also fixed 
on november   we entered into an interest rate swap transaction under which we pay variable rates and we receive fixed rate 
the interest swap effectively converted million of our long term debt with fixed interest rate into debt with variable rates of interest 
our interest rate swap  which expires on february   has a total notional amount of million and relates to our million senior notes 
under this swap transaction we pay an interest rate equal to the month libor rate plus a fixed spread 
in exchange  we receive fixed interest rates of 
our interest rate swap creates interest rate risk for us 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
failure to attract and retain key personnel and skilled associates could hurt our operations 
our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical associates 
losing the services of key personnel could harm us 
our business also depends upon our ability to continue to attract key executives and retain senior managers and skilled associates 
failure to do so could harm our business 
failure to comply with environmental regulations could harm our business 
as a company in the electronics manufacturing services industry  we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations  including those relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process as well as air quality and water quality regulations  restrictions on water use  and storm water regulations 
although we have never sustained any significant loss as a result of non compliance with such regulations  any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant costs to comply with regulations 
we own and lease some contaminated sites for some of which we have been indemnified by third parties for required remediation  sites for which there is a risk of the presence of contamination  and sites with some levels of contamination for which we may be liable and which may or may not ultimately require any remediation 
we have obtained environmental insurance to reduce potential environmental liability exposures posed by some of our operations and facilities 
we believe  based on our current knowledge  that the cost of any groundwater or soil clean up that may be required at our facilities would not materially harm our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  the process of remediating contamination in soil and groundwater at facilities is costly and cannot be estimated with high levels of confidence  and there can be no assurance that the costs of such activities would not harm our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights and could become involved in intellectual property disputes 
our ability to effectively compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we hold a number of patents  patent applications  and various other trade secrets and license rights 
these patents  trade secrets  and license rights may not provide meaningful protection for our manufacturing processes and equipment innovations  or we might find it necessary to initiate litigation proceedings to protect our intellectual property rights 
any such litigation could be lengthy and costly and could harm our consolidated financial condition 
in the past we have been and may from time to time continue to be  notified of claims that we may be infringing patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights owned by other parties 
in the event of an infringement claim  we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop a non infringing alternative  to obtain licenses  and or to defend against the claim 
we may not be successful in developing such an alternative or obtaining a license on reasonable terms  if at all 
any litigation  even where an infringement claim is without merit  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
accordingly  the resolution or adjudication of intellectual property disputes could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
our rating downgrades make it more expensive for us to borrow money 
on october  standard and poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to b with a stable outlook 
on october  moody s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to b with a stable outlook 
these rating downgrades increase our cost of capital should we borrow under our revolving lines of credit  and may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future 
such capital raising activities may be on terms that may not be acceptable to us or otherwise not available 
on june   standard and poor s affirmed our senior unsecured rating and revised our outlook to positive from stable
