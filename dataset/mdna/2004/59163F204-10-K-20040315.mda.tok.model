results of operations for the periods discussed below should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected in any future period and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly and annual operating results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on factors such as changes in the telecommunications market  the addition or expiration of customer contracts  increased competition  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  lengthy sales cycles  advertising costs or lack of market acceptance associated with the introduction of new versions of our products or features  the cost and success of new growth strategies  the timing of the initiation of wireless or other telecommunications services through new delivery systems or their acceptance by customers  the timing and expense of the expansion or contraction of our national call center network  the general employment environment  general economic conditions and the other factors discussed under the heading issues and uncertainties in this item overview we are the leading developer and provider of enhanced directory assistance and information services 
we primarily contract with wireless carriers to provide these services to their subscribers 
under our contracts  carriers agree to route some or all of their directory assistance calls to us 
we offer our services to multiple carriers within the same market 
when a carrier s subscribers dial a typical directory assistance number  such as  or  the calls are routed to and answered by our operators identifying the service by that carrier s brand name  such as nextel or alltel directory plus 
each carrier customer establishes its own directory assistance fee structure for its subscribers 
wireless subscribers typically pay fees ranging from to plus airtime charges for our services 
we bear no subscriber collection risk with respect to carrier subscribers  however  there may be collection risk to the extent growth and profitability in the telecommunications industry decreases and to the extent we provide services to other types of customers  including businesses  governmental units or callers attracted through other means or affiliations 
we charge our carrier customers directly on a per call basis  with prices varying in some cases based on call volume 
in order to encourage our carrier customers to route more of their calls to us  our long term strategy has been based in part on reducing the price we charge them 
we expect that average revenue per call may continue to decrease over time  as we believe this pricing strategy better positions us to retain and expand service with existing carrier customers  where profitable  and to attract new carrier customers 
prices for services provided to other types of customers  including businesses  governmental units or other callers  may vary based on the nature of the service  volume and other circumstances 
competition in the telecommunications industry  and in the directory assistance market in which we participate  has recently been intense 
with slowing subscriber growth and declining revenue per user  carriers are looking to lower their costs of providing directory assistance and other services through  among other ways  outsourcing to low cost domestic or overseas operators and utilizing automation to reduce costs 
in response to these and other issues  in may  we launched infone  a service that provides enhanced directory and personal assistant services directly to consumers 
callers may use the service from nearly any domestic telephone  landline or wireless  simply by dialing billing is handled by using a major credit card 
calls can be connected nationwide and to canada and puerto rico for the all inclusive price of cents for any call of up to minutes  plus cents per minute after that 
the initial launch of infone was accompanied by a significant nationwide marketing and promotion campaign designed to build brand awareness and encourage customers to sign up for infone 
during fiscal  we spent approximately million on such marketing and promotion campaigns  and we will likely spend significant additional funds on marketing and promotional activities in the future 
significant events our contract with at t wireless expired on december   and we were unable to reach an economic arrangement acceptable to both parties  thus  our negotiations did not result in a new contract to replace the existing one 
at t wireless accounted for approximately  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
we expect that the call volume from at t wireless will transition away from us during the second quarter of the expiration of our contract with at t wireless will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  future operating results and cash flows  as well as our operations 
we expect to adjust personnel  call centers and network capacities in order to address varying business circumstances  including the expiration of this contract 
our contract with sprint pcs expired on december  we agreed to a transition arrangement with sprint pcs  pursuant to which we continued to handle its subscribers calls subsequent to december  the transition began in march and was substantially completed by june  revenue from sprint pcs accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
in february  we completed a transaction with sonera media holding b 
v 
sonera  at that time a wholly owned subsidiary of sonera corporation of helsinki  finland  whereby sonera purchased six million newly issued shares of our common stock at a price of per share  for an aggregate price of million and an approximate ownership position at that time 
a portion of the proceeds from this transaction was used to pay off all outstanding debt 
in august  the shares were transferred to sonera holding bv  another wholly owned subsidiary of sonera corporation 
in december  sonera merged with telia ab to form teliasonera ab 
according to a schedule d a filed with the securities and exchange commission in january  teliasonera ab reported that it no longer holds any shares of our common stock 
results of operations the following table shows selected items of our statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues years ended december  revenues direct operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses impairment loss on goodwill and related intangible assets loss income from operations other income  net interest and loan fees loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss income compared to revenues 
revenues decreased to million from million 
call volume decreased to approximately million calls from approximately million calls 
these decreases resulted primarily from lower call volume from sprint pcs due to expiration of their contract  partially offset by growth in call volume under other existing contracts and markets 
our average revenue per call was effectively in both and direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses consist of costs of salaries  wages  benefits and taxes of call center personnel and costs of listings data and content acquisition 
these expenses decreased to million from million 
this decrease was primarily due to lower personnel and data costs associated with servicing lower call volumes 
as a percentage of revenues  direct operating expenses increased to from  due primarily to higher costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million 
this increase resulted primarily from marketing and promotion costs of approximately million and increased network costs associated with our infone service 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to from resulting from lower revenue and increased marketing  promotion and network costs 
impairment loss on goodwill and related intangible assets 
based on our evaluation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
during  we determined that goodwill and certain related intangible assets were impaired  thus  goodwill in the amount of million and non amortizing intangible assets of approximately  were written off during the fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million from million  due primarily to equipment purchased for upgrades of our corporate wide infrastructure and existing call centers and product development activities 
other income  net 
other income for the years ended december  and consisted primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents of approximately  and  respectively 
the decrease in resulted primarily from a decrease in cash available for investment and a decrease in market interest rates 
interest expense was not significant in either or income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit for was approximately million resulting primarily from our ability to carry current year losses back to offset income in prior years and to receive refunds of income taxes paid in those years 
income tax expense for was million for an effective tax rate of approximately which resulted from the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately partially offset by various federal and state tax credits 
compared to revenues 
revenues increased to million from million 
call volume grew to approximately million calls from approximately million calls 
these increases resulted from growth in call volume under existing contracts and markets  as well as new call volume from new contracts and new markets 
our average revenue per call was approximately in compared to in as we continued to offer volume pricing discounts to encourage carrier customers to send us additional call volume 
direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses  consisting of the costs of salaries  wages  benefits and taxes of call center personnel  listings data and content acquisition costs  increased to million from million 
this increase was primarily due to the costs of servicing increased call volumes 
as a percentage of revenues  direct operating expenses decreased to from  due primarily to operating efficiencies realized from greater call volumes and lower costs of accessing information content 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million resulting primarily from additional costs necessary to support our increased call center capacity and call volumes 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses remained approximately flat at in compared to in with additional efficiencies related to the growth of our business offset by new product development costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by to million from million  due primarily to equipment purchased for new call centers  for upgrades and expansions of existing call centers and product development activities offset by the decrease in amortization of  due to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
other income  net 
other income for the years ended december  and consisted primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents of approximately  and million  respectively 
the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in market interest rates 
interest expense and loan fees 
interest expense and loan fees decreased  to  in from  in this decrease resulted from a reduction in average debt outstanding during the year 
all debt was paid in full as of march  income tax expense 
income tax expense for was million for an effective tax rate of approximately which resulted from the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately partially offset by various federal and state tax credits 
for  income tax expense was million for an effective tax rate of approximately 
this rate differs from the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately due primarily to the use of net operating loss carryforwards and various federal and state tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are recorded at cost which approximates their fair market value 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash including million of restricted cash compared to approximately million including million of restricted cash at december  the net decrease of million resulted primarily from our use of cash to advertise  market and promote our infone service and capital expenditures of approximately million  partially offset by cash generated from operations excluding advertising  marketing and promotional expenditures 
we have no outstanding debt 
working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  this decrease was primarily due to working capital used to advertise  market and promote infone and by the use of working capital for capital expenditures  partially offset by working capital generated from operations excluding advertising  marketing and promotional expenditures 
cash flow from operations 
net cash used in operations was million in compared to net cash provided by operations of million in this difference resulted primarily from a decrease in revenues and our use of cash to market and promote infone  partially offset by a decrease in cash paid to or on behalf of employees and a decrease in federal and state income tax payments 
cash received from customers decreased by approximately million  and cash paid to employees decreased by approximately million  in compared to  primarily resulting from the expiration of our contract with sprint pcs 
as a result of the net loan generated in  we paid approximately  in federal and state income taxes in compared to approximately million in cash flow from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  capital expenditures were primarily for equipment to upgrade existing call centers and corporate networks and infrastructure 
in  cash used in investing activities was related primarily to capital expenditures for the purchase of equipment for new call centers  the upgrade and expansion of existing call centers  upgrades and expansions of corporate networks and infrastructure and  in  cash paid in the acquisition of a data extraction and processing company 
cash flow from financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and and was primarily related to cash used to secure a letter of credit offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  resulting primarily from the proceeds of the investment by sonera and the receipt of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and from employee stock purchases  offset by the repayment of all outstanding debt 
future capital needs and resources 
the primary uses of our capital in the near future are expected to be for the continued advertising  marketing and promotion of infone  the development or acquisition of technologies  features and content complementary to our business and for general corporate purposes 
these general corporate purposes could include acquisitions  efforts to pursue and market new growth strategies  other corporate development activities and working capital 
we have begun to adjust personnel  and expect to adjust personnel  call centers and network capacities in order to address varying business circumstances  including the expiration of our contract with at t wireless 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
although cash on hand including restricted cash at december  was approximately million  future activities  including advertising  marketing and promoting infone  execution of new product initiatives and growth strategies  new product development and rollout may reduce available cash 
in such event  we will attempt to establish borrowing arrangements in order to maintain adequate liquidity 
depending on the development of our business  we believe we will have access to future financing sources  although we cannot provide assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
contractual obligations and commitments 
our contractual obligations are presented in the table below 
other than operating leases  we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements or obligations 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations total we generally lease our facilities through non cancelable operating leases extending for up to ten years 
from time to time  in the normal course of our business  we issue standby letters of credit and bank guarantees 
at december   we had one letter of credit outstanding in the amount of million related to our workers compensation insurance program 
the letter of credit is secured by a certificate of deposit for the same amount that is recorded as restricted cash 
this commitment expires on april  and is typically renewed on an annual basis 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  these contractual obligations and commitments are not reflected in our balance sheets 
effect of inflation inflation did not materially affect our business during the last several years 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management believes that of our significant accounting policies see note to the financial statements  those governing accounts receivable  the lives and recoverability of the carrying amount of equipment and other long lived assets  such as existing intangibles and goodwill  estimates involving the levels of our contingent liabilities for workers compensation and medical self insurance and estimates of current and deferred taxes owed may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation and uncertainty 
accounts receivable 
our customer base has primarily consisted of large wireless telephone carriers in the united states 
as such  we have had minimal risk of uncollectability  at any point in time  related to outstanding accounts receivable with these customers 
we have not experienced significant collection issues or write offs related to these customers 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in relatively few of these wholesale customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of them could adversely impact collection of our accounts receivable and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future operating results 
in addition  with the launch of our infone service  we generate receivables from retail customers and businesses that may expose us to greater risk of uncollectible receivables than we have experienced in the past 
long lived assets and goodwill 
we evaluate the remaining life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including patents and trademarks and internally developed software  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
at such time  we estimate the future cash flows expected upon eventual disposition and  if lower than the carrying amount  adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
because of our changing business conditions and dependence on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues  our estimates of future cash flows to be generated from our operations could change materially  resulting in the need for us to record an impairment charge 
in addition  as a result of our changing business conditions  we expect to adjust personnel  call centers and network capacities 
if any of these activities result in certain of our assets no longer being used in operations  we may need to record an impairment charge 
goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination  was amortized on a straight line basis  over its estimated economic life  through december  on january   we adopted sfas no 
under sfas no 
 we discontinued amortization of goodwill and are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill is impaired 
when we performed our evaluation of goodwill in  particularly given the expiration of our contract with at t wireless in december  our analysis indicated that our estimate of the fair value of our business  as determined by the market price of our stock  was less than its carrying value  therefore  the book value of goodwill and related intangibles of approximately million was written off during the fourth quarter of self insurance reserves 
we self insure a portion of our workers compensation and employee medical insurance programs 
we purchase stop loss coverage at varying levels in order to mitigate our potential future losses 
the nature of these liabilities  which may not fully manifest themselves for several years  requires significant judgment 
we evaluate pending workers compensation and medical claims periodically to determine the reasonableness of the reserves we have recorded for such claims 
our evaluation includes estimates of potential incurred but unreported claims as well as factors that may cause original estimates of such claims to increase over time  such as available claims data and historical trends and experience  as well as future projections of ultimate losses  expenses  premiums and administrative costs 
we adjust these reserves if events or changes in circumstances indicate that ultimate payments related to the claims will be more than the recorded reserves 
while we believe that the amounts reserved for these obligations are sufficient  any significant increase in the number of claims and costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
due to differences in the recognition of items included in income for accounting and tax purposes  temporary differences arise which are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities 
we estimate the likelihood of recovery of these assets  which is dependent on future levels of profitability and enacted tax rates 
should any amounts be determined not to be recoverable  or assumptions change  we would be required to take a charge  which could have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  the provisions of which are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under previous guidance  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
we adopted this statement effective january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued financial interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the disclosure requirements in this interpretation were applied as of december  we adopted the recognition provisions of fin effective january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
issues and uncertainties while management is optimistic about our long term prospects  the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our outlook 
we have contracts with a limited number of carrier customers 
if we fail to extend or renew these contracts  or if these contracts are terminated prior to their expiration  our business could be adversely affected 
a limited number of customers account for substantially all our revenues 
for example  our top four customers accounted for approximately of our revenues in our two largest customers  at t wireless services  and nextel communications accounted for approximately of our revenues in our contract with at t wireless expired in december as described above in significant events 
in addition  our contract with alltel communications expired in december while we did enter into an extension agreement  it is not currently a long term arrangement 
our contract with nextel communications extends through early in some contracts contain performance and other standards and may be terminated prior to their scheduled expiration dates under specified circumstances 
if we fail to extend or replace our contracts  or other contracts are terminated prior to their expiration  our business could be adversely affected 
although we seek to increase the number of our customers  opportunities are limited because a small number of companies dominate the telecommunications market 
this limits the potential carrier customer base and our expansion opportunities through carrier relationships 
our inability to achieve desired pricing levels could adversely affect our profitability and operations 
we are subject to competitive pressures with respect to pricing that could adversely affect our profitability and operations 
the prices that we charge our carrier customers are subject to the terms of our contracts 
the changing telecommunications market  the relative leverage of the negotiating parties and the overall competitive landscape can significantly impact contract pricing negotiations 
we charge our carrier customers on a per call basis  with prices varying in some cases based on call volume 
our long term strategy is based in part on reducing the price we charge our carrier customers 
generally  our pricing levels have declined and  in the future  will likely continue to decline as call volumes increase with specific carrier customers and in response to competition in the industry 
if we were to substantially reduce our prices without correspondingly increasing volume  there could be an adverse impact on our ability to operate profitably 
we face substantial competition from a number of other companies 
many of our competitors in the directory assistance market  including the regional bell operating companies  have far greater resources and better name recognition 
the regional bell operating companies also may have the advantage of being the local telephone carrier in their area of operation 
some of these companies are or may be developing their own versions of quality directory assistance services 
we also face competition from a number of other independent directory assistance providers 
individual competitors may also seek to provide low cost domestic or offshore service or to provide automation of directory assistance services 
if we are unable to compete successfully  it could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our ability to compete successfully depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate and appropriately respond to many factors  including retail pricing decisions by carriers  decisions by carriers to force consumers to accept lower quality information services products  the introduction of new services and products by our competitors  changes in subscriber preferences  changes in economic conditions and discount pricing strategies by our competitors 
we may not gain customer acceptance of our infone service or the costs of advertising  marketing and promotion of infone to obtain such acceptance may result in future losses and pressure on our liquidity and capital resources 
in order to build awareness among consumers and encourage them to sign up for our infone service  we have undertaken a national advertising and marketing campaign that has required significant expenditures to date and likely will require that further expenditures be made to gain consumer acceptance 
these expenditures have necessarily preceded the receipt of substantial revenues from customers for the infone services 
if our customer base and related number of calls for this service do not grow to generate sufficient levels of revenue on a timely basis  or our financial and pricing assumptions are not accurate  these advertising and marketing expenses may result in further losses and pressure on our liquidity and capital resources 
in such event  we may need additional financing  but there can be no assurance that such financing would be available or that the terms offered would be acceptable to us 
because the infone service is still in its initial stages and until we gain more experience with consumer acceptance  it will be difficult to predict our future results of operations 
we are dependent on the wireless telecommunications industry  and a decrease in wireless usage by subscribers could have an adverse impact on our results of operations  additionally  consolidation of  or reduction in  the number of carrier competitors in this industry could affect us adversely 
most of our revenues have historically come from providing enhanced directory assistance and information services to wireless carrier customers subscribers 
a decrease in wireless usage in general  or of our products in particular  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
wireless usage by subscribers appears to be affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including pricing  safety concerns  reliability and availability of the wireless network  government regulation and reliability and availability of alternative technologies 
our quarterly and annual operating results may vary significantly in part due to factors outside our control 
in the future  as in the past  our quarterly and annual operating results may vary significantly as a result of a number of factors 
we cannot control many of these factors  which include  among others changes in the telecommunications market  including the addition or withdrawal of carriers from the market  changes in technology and increased competition from existing and new competitors  the timing and expense of our call center network expansion or contraction  including changing staffing and infrastructure expenses related to anticipated call volume changes  the continued costs of advertising  marketing and promotion of infone without commensurate consumer acceptance or revenues  the addition or expiration of contracts with carrier customers  changes in our or our competitors  customers or suppliers pricing policies  lengthy sales cycles for new and extended contracts  the timing of the commencement of our services under new or existing contracts with our carrier customers  which depends in part on the customers ability to adapt their networks and billing systems to allow them to transfer calls to us  lack of market acceptance or delays or increased development costs related to the introduction of our services or features  and general economic conditions 
for these reasons  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our financial results as an indication of any future results 
our future operating results could fall below the expectations of securities industry analysts or investors 
any such shortfall could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 
fluctuations in our operating results would likely increase the volatility of our common stock price 
the rapidly changing telecommunications market could unfavorably affect us 
the telecommunications market is subject to rapid change and uncertainty that may result in competitive situations which could unfavorably affect us 
these changes and uncertainties are due to  among other factors  the following mergers  acquisitions and alliances among carriers and among our competitors  which can result in fewer carriers in the marketplace  lost carrier customers  increased negotiating leverage for newly affiliated carriers and more effective competitors  changes in the regulatory environment  which may affect us directly  by affecting our ability to access and update listings data at a reasonable cost  or indirectly  by restricting our carrier customers ability to operate or provide a competitive service  increasing availability of alternative methods for delivery of directory assistance and other information services  including the internet  evolving industry standards  including frequent technological changes and new product introductions  and changes in retail prices offered to consumers for our services or for services perceived to be substitutes for ours  in whole or in part 
we have a long sales cycle which may cause delays that adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results 
a customer s decision to contract for our directory assistance and information services involves a significant commitment of technical and other resources 
as a result  we have a long sales cycle for both new and extended contracts  particularly with large customers 
the selling process involves demonstrating the value added benefits of outsourcing directory assistance and using our services rather than those of our competitors 
additionally  the effectiveness of our marketing to other types of customers  including businesses  governmental units or callers attracted through other means or affiliations  is difficult to predict at any given point in time  given a wide variety of potential business circumstances 
any delays due to lengthy sales cycles could significantly affect our revenue growth and operating results 
our operating results are significantly affected by our ability to accurately estimate the amount and timing of call volume  which is often subject to factors outside of our control 
our operating results are significantly affected by costs incurred for expanding or contracting staffing and infrastructure 
we incur significant staffing and general and administrative costs in contracting operations  if necessary  and in anticipation of additional call volume under our customer contracts 
if such call volume does not depart or arrive as scheduled  in the amount anticipated  or at all  our operating results can be adversely affected 
this could increase our operating expenses without a corresponding increase in revenues 
we need to maintain or expand call volume and increase efficiencies in order to be successful 
in order to successfully execute our business strategies  we need to maintain or increase the volume of calls made to our call center network  while realizing the benefits of operating leverage 
we intend to increase call volume by seeking additional customers  including landline carrier customers  as well as seeking additional business from our existing carrier customers and through our infone service and by offering our services to other types of customers 
we have limited experience in the landline market  which is dominated by the regional bell operating companies 
if we are unable to expand our wireless business or attract significant landline business  or grow our infone revenues on a cost effective basis or at all  we may be unable to attain meaningful profitability or sustain past growth rates 
regulations affecting our customers and suppliers and future regulations to which we may be subject may adversely affect our business 
while in the past  our principal business as a wholesale supplier of enhanced directory assistance and information services for telecommunications common carriers has not been directly regulated  the offering of those services to the public by our customers is regulated by various federal and state regulatory authorities 
the federal communications commission fcc has jurisdiction over all us telecommunications common carriers to the extent they provide interstate or international communications services  including  in our case  the use of our local networks to originate or terminate such services 
the operations of our infone service currently involve interstate and intrastate communications services 
the application of the fcc s current and or future policies could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial conditions 
to the extent that we provide telecommunications services that originate and terminate within the same state  including in state long distance toll calls  we are subject to regulation by that state s utility commission 
we are subject to direct regulation in all jurisdictions in which we operate 
many jurisdictions require certification before a company can provide intrastate communications services 
we are certified as an interexchange carrier in all jurisdictions where required  and as a local exchange carrier where required 
we are also subject to numerous local  state and federal taxes and regulatory fees  including the federal excise tax  fcc universal service and regulatory fees and numerous public utility commission regulatory fees 
we have procedures in place to ensure that we properly collect taxes and fees from our customers and remit such taxes and fees to the appropriate entity pursuant to applicable law and or regulation 
if our collection procedures prove to be insufficient or if a taxing or regulatory authority determines that our remittances were inadequate  we could be required to make additional payments  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other aspects of our services may be subject to state or federal regulation  such as regulations relating to the confidentiality of data and communications  copyright issues  and taxation of services 
we cannot predict the actions that federal  state  and local regulators may take or what impact such actions would have on our business 
future acquisitions or efforts to pursue additional growth strategies may strain our operations 
we intend to evaluate  and in the future may pursue  acquisition or business opportunities that are consistent with our business strategy 
if we fail to adequately address financial and operational risks associated with such acquisitions or business opportunities  such activities may adversely affect our business 
these risks can include  among other things difficulties in assimilating the operations  technology  information systems and personnel of an acquired company  including the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls and policies  and the loss of key employees of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  impairment of relationships with licensors  customers and suppliers  difficulties in entering into markets in which we have no direct prior experience and potential marketing expenses related thereto  use of cash resources  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities  and significant write offs related to goodwill and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets 
if we are unable to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop new services and features  we may not succeed 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new services and features that are accepted by the marketplace and cost effective for us to provide as a part of our overall service offerings 
the development of new services and features can be very expensive 
further  given rapid technological changes  frequent introduction of new products  services and features  and changing consumer demands that characterize our industry  it can be difficult to correctly anticipate future changes in technology and industry standards 
if we fail to develop new services and features  encounter difficulties that delay the introduction of such services and features  or incorrectly anticipate future changes and develop services and features that are not accepted by the marketplace or are not cost effective for us to provide as a part of our overall service offerings  we may not succeed at our business 
alternative methods for delivery of directory assistance and information services could reduce the demand for our services 
our business comes primarily from providing enhanced directory assistance and information services to telephone users 
however  information can be transmitted in other ways  including more intelligent communications devices and other technologies and protocols  and over the internet 
for example  as the internet continues to develop and becomes easier to use and access  technologies may be developed that decrease or eliminate the demand for telephone based or voice based directory or information services 
widespread acceptance of existing and developing technologies and protocols  such as voice recognition and wireless application protocol  could adversely affect our business 
our call volume could decline if telephone users change their usage habits and rely on the internet or other alternatives as their primary source for information 
systems failures  delays and other problems could harm our reputation and business  cause us to lose customers and expose us to customer liability 
our success also depends on our ability to provide reliable services 
our operations could be interrupted by significant damage to or failure of our network  our connections to third parties  our computer hardware or software or our customers or suppliers computer hardware or software 
any such significant damage or failure could disrupt the operations of our network and the provision of our services and result in the loss of current and potential customers 
in addition  if call volume increases  we may need to expand and or upgrade our technology and network hardware and software in order to provide services 
capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may make it difficult for us to expand and upgrade our systems in a timely and economical manner 
if we are unable to obtain or adequately update directory or information content at an economical cost  we may be unable to provide current levels of service or improve our service 
our operations depend on our access to the names  telephone numbers and other information that we supply directly to callers or we use in providing our services 
the availability  cost  quality and usefulness of such data varies widely across geographic regions 
if we are unable to obtain or update directory or information content at an economical cost  we may be unable to provide current levels of service  improve our enhanced directory assistance service or provide new services and features 
ultimately  the satisfaction of callers and our carrier customers  and our ability to renew and extend our current customer contracts  enter into new customer contracts and expansion of our infone service  depends on the quality of services we provide

as we rely on a limited number of suppliers  an abrupt loss of any key supplier could adversely affect our business operations or delay our development efforts 
we rely on some key suppliers to provide us with programming and engineering services and to license us their technology

if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified senior management  technical personnel and call center operators  or our call center staff is unionized  our operations could be adversely affected 
our success depends to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  technical personnel and call center operators 
the loss of the services of our senior management and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to meet our strategic objectives 
we also depend on the continued service of our call center operators  who we hire from the available labor pool 
the ability to attract and retain qualified senior management  technical personnel  operators and other skilled employees is extremely important to the operation of our business 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals  or we are required to pay significantly higher wages and other benefits to such individuals  or if our call center staff is unionized  it could adversely affect our business operations 
we find it more difficult to recruit and retain qualified individuals during periods of low unemployment and  therefore  may be subject to increasing pressure to offer higher wages and other benefits during such periods 
in our call center hiring  we may also feel the effects of the telecommunications industry in general  which has widespread union membership among its operators and other workers 
if we are unable to use and protect our intellectual property  we may be unable to provide some of our enhanced directory assistance and information services or profitably operate our business 
we regard aspects of our enhanced directory assistance and information services and their features and processes to be proprietary 
if we are unable to use and protect our intellectual property  we may be unable to provide some of our enhanced directory assistance and information services or profitably operate our business 
to a limited extent  we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent and other intellectual property law  nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our intellectual property 
however  these measures may be difficult and costly to meaningfully enforce 
in addition  attempts to enforce our intellectual property rights may bring into question the validity of these rights 
litigation with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights can result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and other resources 
we may need additional capital in the future  and it may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may require more capital in the future to fund our operations  finance investments in equipment and infrastructure needed to maintain or expand our call center and network capabilities  enhance and expand the range of services and features we offer  respond to competitive pressures and potential opportunities  such as investments  acquisitions and new product initiatives and growth strategies and advertise  market and promote infone 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
the terms of available financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility 
if adequate financing is not available on acceptable terms  we may be forced to reduce our operations or abandon expansion opportunities 
if we expand our business into international markets  we will encounter risks which could adversely affect us 
we have operated only in the united states  however  an element of our business strategy is to continue to explore international business opportunities 
if we expand into one or more international markets  we will encounter significant risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include increased operational difficulties arising from  among other things our ability to attract sufficient business or locate a suitable partner or joint venture candidate to enable us to overcome logistical and economic barriers to entry  our ability and cost to gather sufficient information content and listings data  properly modify our features and services to meet applicable standards  and hire and train personnel  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and political  regulatory and economic developments and cultural differences 
our common stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has experienced volatility and is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in response to a number of factors 
these factors include  among others  those that affect our quarterly and annual operating results and the following announcements of extensions  expirations or changes in our contracts and the effects on our call centers and infrastructure of such activities  announcements relating to material events concerning our customers  actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  the success of our infone service  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  obsolescence of technologies that we or our customers use  introductions of new technologies  products or features  new product initiatives and growth strategies  and general market conditions 
from january  through december   our common stock price fluctuated from a low of per share to a high of per share and has on several days fluctuated more than 
these trading prices may change significantly and arbitrarily 
in addition  broad market factors affecting telecommunications or technology stocks may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
general economic  political and market conditions  including interest rate changes and recession  may also adversely affect our stock price 
our results of operations could be impacted by a significant increase in the rate of inflation 
inflation has not historically had a material affect on our business 
operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and occupancy costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures which could adversely affect our operating results 
oregon law and provisions of our charter could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
we are authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  and our board of directors has the authority to fix the preferences  limitations and relative rights of those shares without any vote or action by the shareholders 
the potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of our company  may discourage bids for the common stock at a premium over the market price and may adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
in addition  provisions under oregon law limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over our company 
these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of our company through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of the board of directors and may deter efforts to obtain control of our company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our liquid investments are invested in money market instruments  and therefore  the fair market value of these investments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
however  these investments were invested in overnight money market instruments at december  and were redeemable on a daily basis 
all of the underlying investments in the money market fund had maturities of three months or less 
as a result  we believe the market risk arising from our holdings of financial instruments is minimal 
a hypothetical fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
