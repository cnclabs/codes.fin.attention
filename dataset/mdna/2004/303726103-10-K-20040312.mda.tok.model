item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview from our beginning as an independent semiconductor company in  we have grown both organically and through acquisitions  to become one of the top suppliers of power semiconductors in the world 
over these past six years  we have focused on developing semiconductors that provide solutions for power management  which we refer to as power products  that serve fast growing consumer  computing  industrial and communications markets 
we have also rapidly expanded our presence in korea and asia regional markets  where we see the highest growth potential over the next several years 
the combined effect of our organic and acquisition driven growth  our ability to service multiple end markets  and our focus on growing in asia have all contributed to us increasing our percent of revenue from power products from just of total sales in to of total sales in we have a wide portfolio of new products that leverage expertise in both analog and discrete power technologies 
some of our newest products combine both of these technologies and provide a total power management solution to our customers 
beginning in and continuing through most of  the semiconductor industry experienced the worst downturn in its history 
throughout this downturn  we have focused on increasing our operational efficiency through streamlining our factories  investing in leading edge supply chain management and business systems  and opening our new suzhou  china assembly and test facility 
during this same downturn  we also maintained record cash and investment levels  as well as reporting straight quarters of positive operating cash flow 
we look at gross margins and operating margins as key indices that reflect our progress in developing the right new products  as well as our ability to manufacture at low cost levels 
other key indices used by the company include factors such as day s sales outstanding dso s and inventory turn ratios  which were roughly flat year over year 
in addition  the company tracks factory utilization  which began to steadily increase during and as of the end of the year  our blended fab capacity utilization  based on our installed equipment  was over  and if demand continues to be strong  may increase further 
as we look into  we believe the steps we have taken to improve our operations and develop new power products  combined with the highest order backlog the company has had in three years and improving macroeconomic factors  all position us well for we believe the power semiconductor market will continue to grow as fast as or faster than the total semiconductor industry over the foreseeable future 
our strategy will be to continue to focus on developing new power process  packaging and circuit technology that will allow us to introduce power products that serve multiple end markets 
we also plan to continue to invest in our more modern fabrication facilities and in our new suzhou assembly and test plant as we believe these are significant factors that will help us to continue to improve gross and operating margins 
overall our focus will remain on growing profitable market share in our power markets

total revenues were down to  million in compared to  million in revenues were impacted in by the continued semiconductor industry recession  as well as the effect of sars  particularly in the middle part of the units shipped were nearly flat year over year  but pricing pressures  particularly in our analog and logic and memory product lines  drove revenues lower 
as a percentage of sales  geographic sales for the united states  other north america  europe  asia pacific which for our geographic reporting purposes excludes korea and korea were as follows for and year ended december  december  united states other north america europe asia pacific korea total 
table of contents geographic sales by region remained consistent year over year 
our slight percentage increase in our asia pacific region is the result of our focus on expanding our presence in this region 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in for  gross profit includes sales reserves of million and inventory reserves of million in connection with product discontinuations as a result of our various restructuring actions 
for  gross profit includes inventory reserves of million in connection with the analog restructuring action 
the remaining decrease in gross profit was a result of continued pricing pressures across most product lines  partially offset by on going manufacturing cost reductions see separate product line discussions below 
operating expenses 
during  in our continued response to the semiconductor industry downturn  we have implemented many cost reduction efforts to reduce our operating expenses 
r d expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in we have reprioritized r d activities on products and technologies in support of power semiconductors and cut costs in r d for other non focus areas 
sg a expenses increased million to of sales in compared to of sales in the increases in sg a were the result of the resumption of certain employee related benefits in these spending increases were partially offset by further cuts in discretionary spending as well as workforce reductions 
amortization of acquisition related intangibles was million in  compared to million in the decrease in amortization is due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of purchased in process research and development was million for  compared to million for in  ipr d resulted from the purchase of raytheon s non military rf components business completed in the fourth quarter of in  ipr d resulted from our acquisitions of i cube and signal processing technologies  inc spt 
further information regarding our ipr d for significant acquisitions  including information on significant assumptions  is addressed below under in process research and development 
due to the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry and in order to align our cost structure with our revenues  we have continued to look at the rationalization of both our manufacturing operations and our workforce levels 
as a result  the company recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million in these charges included million of employee separation costs for severance and other costs associated with workforce reduction actions undertaken during the year  including the closure of our fab in mountaintop  pa  the closure of the fab in south portland  me  the planned plant closures in wuxi  china and kuala lumpur  malaysia  and million of impairment  decommissioning and other exit costs relating to the closure of our above referenced fab and plant closures  as well as asset impairment charges in bucheon  south korea 
as a result of these restructuring plans commenced during  we have completed actions which we expect will result in cost savings of approximately million on an annualized basis when compared to our cost structure during the fourth quarter of we expect to achieve to million of additional annualized cost savings as the remaining actions initiated during are finalized in restructuring and impairments of million were recorded in these charges included million of employee separation costs for severance and other costs associated with workforce reduction actions undertaken during the year  million for contract termination costs and million of impairment charges related to the closure of our carlsbad  california facility 
as a result of the restructuring plans completed during  we achieved approximately million in annualized cost savings when compard to our cost structure at the beginning of for further detailed disclosure relating to our restructuring and impairment charges during and  please see item  note of this report 
a gain on the sale of our space and defense product line was recorded in that did not reoccur in as a result of the sale of our space and defense product line for million  a gain on sale of million was recorded 
the net carrying value of the assets sold consisted primarily of inventory million  developed technology million  and customer contracts  net of certain liabilities million not assumed by the buyer 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in the decrease was principally the result of the redemption of million of senior subordinated notes on june  as well as the redemption of million of senior subordinated notes on june  these redemptions are offset by interest on our new million term loan which carried an interest rate of approximately at december  interest income 
interest income was million in  compared to million in the decrease was due to a lower interest rate environment in other expense 
during  we recorded other expense of million associated with the redemption of our senior subordinated notes and the refinancing of our revolving line of credit 
these costs included million for the call premium on the senior subordinated notes and other transaction fees and a million non cash write off of deferred financing fees associated with the original bond offering and revolving line of credit 
during  we recorded other expense of million associated with the redemption of our senior subordinated notes 
these costs included million for the call premium on the senior subordinated notes and other transaction fees and a million non cash write off of deferred financing fees associated with the original bond offering 
income taxes 
income tax benefit was million in  compared to million in the effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate in as compared to was due to the changes in the magnitude and location of taxable income among taxing jurisdictions 
changes in the location of taxable income loss could result in significant changes in the effective tax rate 
comparative disclosures of revenue and gross profit of our reportable segments are as follows year ended december  december  of gross of gross revenue total profit revenue total profit dollars in millions analog and mixed signal discrete logic and memory other total analog and mixed signal products group 
the decrease in analog revenue was driven primarily by declining average selling prices on slightly higher unit volumes  across virtually all products 
consistent with the overall analog market  these pricing pressures continued throughout due to factory utilization at historically low levels 
markets in all regions were soft  particularly in asia where the sars epidemic drove significant demand and pricing weakness during the second and third quarters of gross profits declined year over year due to the previously discussed pricing pressures and weak economic climate 
the decreases during also include million of sales reserves included in revenue  and million of inventory charges included in cost of sales  both associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our restructuring actions  offset by a million inventory charge included in cost of sales in  associated with the analog restructuring action 
starting in late  demand  unit shipments and gross profits for analog products improved  primarily due to a recovery in asia and new product success in analog switches 
analog had operating income loss of million in compared to million in the decrease in analog s operating income was consistent with declines in gross profits due to the previously discussed severe pricing pressure and lower factory utilization throughout most of r d and sg a expenses were roughly flat year over year 
strategic r d spending was maintained despite tough economic conditions  which will prove vital to improved market share in 
table of contents discrete products group 
the increase in discrete revenues was due to increased average selling prices somewhat offset by lower unit volumes 
the increase in prices and decrease in unit volumes was somewhat offset by the small signal business  which is categorized by low average selling prices and high unit volumes 
the increases in average selling prices were also partially offset by the divestiture of the space and defense product line  which was characterized by high margins and high average selling prices 
excluding million of revenues in related to the space and defense product line  which we divested  discrete revenues increased approximately over  primarily from our power discrete products 
these products showed strength in computing and communications segment  particularly in the second half of as the industry rebounded from the sars epidemic in asia 
while revenues increased  gross profits were roughly flat primarily due to the divestiture of the space and defense product line  which as discussed  historically was characterized with higher margins 
gross profits in also include million of sales reserves and million of inventory  both associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our restructuring actions 
discrete had operating income of million in as compared to million in the increase in operating income was due primarily to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized at the end of r d expenses increased slightly due to the rf acquisition in the fourth quarter of sg a expenses were flat as a percentage of sales 
logic and memory products group 
the decrease in logic and memory revenues was driven primarily by a sharp decline in average selling prices on roughly flat unit volumes  particularly in our mature logic products 
advanced logic and tiny logic products also experienced significant pricing pressures  however unit volume improvement nearly offset the declines in selling prices 
gross profits also declined year over year due to the previously discussed pricing pressures  particularly in korea and asia  and lower factory utilization due to a change in product mix 
the decreases during also include million of sales reserves and million of inventory charges  both associated with the discontinuation of certain products in connection with our restructuring actions 
during  we also announced the exit from our memory business  which contributed to already existing revenue declines 
the revenues for memory declined from logic and memory had operating income loss of million in  compared to million in the decrease in logic and memory s operating income was a result of gross profit declines due to the pricing pressures and industry conditions discussed above 
these declines were offset slightly by lower r d spending in our mature product lines as well as lower sg a expenses 
the reduction in spending was due to cost cutting in response to declining market conditions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues 
revenues of  were roughly flat in compared to  million in the slight increase in revenues was due to higher unit volumes  offset by lower average selling prices due to continued pricing pressures

table of contents the north american sales region has been impacted by a shrinking market due to the continued migration of electronic components manufacturing offshore  primarily to china and elsewhere in asia 
all market segments exhibited weakness except for small improvements in the automotive segment 
european revenues were impacted by the same factors affecting north america  with particular weakness in the communications market 
revenues in our asia pacific sales region increased due in part to the continued migration of electronics production into the region as well as strength in industrial  consumer and computing markets 
sales in korea increased primarily due to strong demand from our largest customer  samsung electronics  particularly for products directed toward consumer and industrial markets 
gross profit 
gross profit for and was million  or of sales  and million  or of sales  respectively  which is roughly flat year over year 
in  the amount includes an inventory charge associated with the discontinuance of the digitizer product line in our analog group million 
operating expenses 
r d expenses were million  or of sales  in  compared to million  or of sales  in the decrease in r d was due to spending reductions in response to softer market conditions  offset by a full year of r d spending for the dpp business  which we acquired in mid sg a expenses were million  or of sales in  compared to million  or of sales in we offset incremental sg a from a full year of the acquired dpp business with discretionary spending reductions and workforce reductions in response to softer market conditions 
amortization of acquisition related intangibles was million in  compared to million in the decrease in amortization was due to our adoption of sfas no 
in  which mandates that goodwill should no longer be amortized  offset by an increase in amortization  due to a full year of amortization of other intangibles acquired in the acquisitions of dpp  impala linear corporation acquisition in the latter part of and spt in march of 
amortization of goodwill in was million 
ipr d expense was million for  compared to million for in  ipr d resulted from our acquisitions of i cube and spt

restructuring and impairments of million were recorded in these charges included an million charge for asset impairments relating to the consolidation of the five inch wafer fabrication line in south portland  maine  and million for employee separation costs 
as a result of the restructuring plans completed during  we achieved approximately million in annualized cost savings when compared to our cost structure at the beginning of the gain on the sale of our space and defense product line was recorded in as a result of the sale of our space and defense product line for million  a gain on sale of million was recorded 
the net carrying value of the assets sold consisted primarily of inventory million  developed technology million  and customer contracts  net of certain liabilities million not assumed by the buyer 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in the decrease was principally the result of the redemption of million of senior subordinated notes on june   partially off set by a full year of interest associated with the million of convertible senior subordinated noted we sold in the fourth quarter of interest income 
interest income was million in  compared to million in the decrease was due to a lower interest rate environment  partially offset by higher cash balances throughout other expense 
during  we recorded other expense of million associated with the redemption of our senior subordinated notes 
these costs included million for the call premium and other 
table of contents transaction fees and a million non cash write off of deferred financing fees associated with the original bond offering 
during  we recorded a loss of million related to the write off of an equity investment 
income taxes 
income tax benefit was million in  compared to million in the effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the benefit in was a result of us losses taxed at us statutory rates 
the us losses were offset by korean income which effectively had no tax expense associated with it 
comparative disclosures of revenue and gross profit of our reportable segments are as follows year ended december  december  of gross of gross revenue total profit revenue total profit dollars in millions analog and mixed signal discrete logic and memory other total analog and mixed signal products group 
analog unit volumes grew  offset slightly by a decline in average selling prices 
the unit volumes increases were a result of higher sales for power switches  motor drivers and high speed converters  predominantly into consumer and industrial markets 
gross profits increased year over year due to previously discussed growth in our unit volumes 
analog had operating income of million in compared to million in the increase in analog s operating income was primarily due to increases in revenues and gross profits as well as decreases in sg a expenses  including a decrease in acquisition amortization due to the adoption of sfas no 
 partially offset by increases in r d 
the increase in gross profits was primarily driven by higher unit volume  offset slightly by decreases in average selling prices 
discrete products group 
discrete unit volumes increased  coupled with a increase in average selling prices 
the increases were due to higher sales of low power mosfet s into the computing and communications markets and a full year of revenue from our dpp acquisition an increase of approximately million over  which occurred late in first quarter of gross profits increased year over year due to increased revenues due to higher unit volumes 
discrete had operating income of million in as compared to million in the increases in discrete s operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profits  primarily in the third quarter of  and a decrease in acquisition amortization due to the adoption of sfas no 
 which includes a partial year of acquisition amortization million in for dpp 
the increase in gross profits was primarily driven by higher unit volume as a result of strong sales in low power mosfet s 
logic and memory products group 
logic and memory unit volumes decreased coupled with a decrease in average selling prices 
gross profit decreases were due to significant price competition in our mature products 
logic and memory had operating income of million in  compared to million in the decrease in logic and memory s operating income was due to decreases in revenues and gross profits  partially offset by decreases in r d and sg a expenses 
in process research and development the company has incurred charges for in process research and development ipr d of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the only significant ipr d charge was in connection with the acquisition of the dpp business in 
table of contents the following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the valuations of ipr d for our significant acquisitions estimated weighted cost to average ipr d complete discount cost of charge technology rate capital dollars in millions dpp with respect to the acquisition of the discrete power products business we allocated million of the purchase price to ipr d projects in this allocation represents the estimated fair value based upon risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete products 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
our management assessed and allocated values to the ipr d 
the values assigned to these assets were determined by identifying significant research projects that were not yet technologically feasible  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of these new products 
our v n channel trench technology is a product expansion of our ultrafet power mosfet trench technology 
this technology provides the next generation of power mosfets with improved electrical properties at a reduced cost 
this silicon technology is targeted for use in computer and industrial power supplies 
there are also broad market uses of this technology in electrical load switching applications 
these new products have smaller die sizes and improved electrical properties in both existing and new packages 
the v n channel trench project represented approximately  or million  of the total fair value assigned to ipr d in the intersil discrete power products acquisition 
we estimate that the project was completed  and that it would require five months to finish at an additional cost of  we used the income approach methodology to assign value to purchased ipr d 
significant assumptions which had to be made using this approach included revenue and operating margin projections and determination of the applicable discount rate 
the forecast for the in process projects related products relied upon sales projections that were based upon targeted market share and pricing estimates over expected product life cycles with significant revenue expected to begin in operating expenses for these products included cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses were estimated as a percentage of revenue  consistent with historical results 
the forecasts we used to value ipr d were based upon assumptions we believe were reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
we cannot assure you that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales or profits will be valid  or that the events associated with such projects  will occur as estimated 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances are likely to occur 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from projected results 
the discount rate selected for dpp s in process technology was 
this discount rate is greater than the weighted average cost of capital approximately at the date of acquisition of dpp and reflects the risk premium associated with achieving forecasted cash flows associated with this project 
these risks include the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and the uncertainty of technological advances that are unknown at this time 
as of december   revenues recognized from this project were not lower than the forecasted revenues used in the calculation of the ipr d value 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has two off balance sheet loan guarantees  totaling million
