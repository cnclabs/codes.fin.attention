item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in review in  southwest posted a profit for the st consecutive year 
the company also extended its streak of consecutive quarterly profits to periods in fourth quarter both of these achievements are unsurpassed in the airline industry 
for the third consecutive year  the airline industry as a whole suffered a net loss and many of the larger airlines underwent or continued massive efforts to restructure their business  gain wage concessions from their employees  and slash costs in efforts to avoid bankruptcy or emerge from bankruptcy 
for the company  although profitability levels have not returned to those achieved prior to the september   terrorist attacks  profits increased considerably versus  even excluding the impact of government grants received in both years 
although the process has been gradual  revenue trends had shown improvement prior to the iraq war  and have steadily improved since major hostilities in iraq ended in may however  air traffic remains depressed compared to pre september   levels  particularly business demand 
unit revenues continue to run below pre september   levels by more than percent and the percentage of customers traveling on full fares remains down from historical levels 
the company does not anticipate a complete recovery in revenues until the economy fully recovers and there is an upturn in business travel 
the company s business strategy did not waver in southwest remained committed to providing predominantly shorthaul flights  high frequency service  low fares  point to point flying  and high quality customer service  all while keeping costs low 
the company also continued to complement this strategy by adding longer haul flights  including transcontinental service 
the company continued to respond to the many security changes imposed since the terrorist attacks and find ways to improve customer convenience and the airport experience 
the company has automated and significantly streamlined the ticketing and boarding process with computer generated bag tags  automated boarding passes  self service boarding pass kiosks  and electronic boarding pass readers at the gate

this brought the company s all fleet to aircraft at the end of during  the company made announcements that are expected to benefit the company s overall cost structure in and beyond 
the company announced it would add blended winglets to its fleet of aircraft 
the addition of these wing enhancements  which began to be retrofitted on existing aircraft in fourth quarter and are expected to take place through early  will extend the range of these aircraft  save fuel  lower engine maintenance costs  and reduce takeoff noise 
new aircraft are expected to arrive with winglets already installed beginning in august in october  the company announced it would no longer pay commissions on travel agency sales effective december   consistent with virtually all other us airlines 
this change in policy is expected

the company believes that excluding the impact of these special items will enhance comparative analysis of results 
the grants were made to stabilize and support the airline industry as a result of the devastating effects of the september  terrorist attacks and the war with iraq 
neither of these grants was indicative of the company s operating performance for these respective periods  nor should they be considered in developing trend analysis for future periods

the increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to a percent increase in revenue passenger miles rpms flown 
although the company saw a disruption in revenue and bookings due to the threat of war and from the subsequent conflict between the united states and iraq during the first half of  demand improved following the war 
the increase in revenue passenger miles primarily was due to a percent increase in added capacity  as measured by available seat miles or asms 
this was achieved through the company s net addition of aircraft during net of four aircraft retirements 
the company s improved load factor for rpms divided by asms was percent  compared to percent for the improved load factor is still well below pre september   annual levels 
passenger yields for passenger revenue divided by rpms were

for first quarter  excluding costs associated with the company s reservations center consolidation  the company currently expects an increase in operating expenses per asm compared to first quarter primarily due to higher salaries  jet fuel prices  and airport costs 
based on the company s aggressive efforts to mitigate these cost pressures  unit costs should begin to decline in the second half of for the year  the company s goal is to  at least  keep unit costs flat with salaries  wages  and benefits expense per asm increased percent 
approximately percent of the increase was due to an increase in salaries and wages per asm  primarily from increases in average wage rates 
the majority of the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in employee retirement plans expense per asm  primarily from the increase in earnings and resulting profitsharing 
the company also expects to experience an increase in salaries  wages  and benefits per asm in due  in part  to restructuring charges related to the consolidation of the company s reservations centers

fuel and oil expense per asm increased percent  primarily due to a percent increase in the average jet fuel cost per gallon 
the average cost per gallon of jet fuel in was cents compared to cents in  excluding fuel related taxes but including the effects of hedging activities 
the company s and average jet fuel costs are net of approximately million and million in gains from hedging activities  respectively

table of contents company has hedges in place for over percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in with a combination of derivative instruments that effectively cap prices at about per barrel  including approximately percent of its anticipated requirements for first quarter considering current market prices and the continued effectiveness of the company s fuel hedges  the company is forecasting first quarter average fuel cost per gallon to be in the to cent range 
the majority of the company s near term hedge positions are in the form of option contracts  which protect the company in the event of rising jet fuel prices and allow the company to benefit in the event of declining prices 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm increased percent primarily due to an increase in engine maintenance 
the company outsources all of its engine maintenance work 
approximately half of the increase in engine maintenance expense was for and aircraft subject to a long term maintenance contract  which is based on a contract rate charged per hour flown 
the majority of the increase in engine expense for these aircraft in was due to an increase in the contract rate per hour flown  predicated on increased engine maintenance events 
the other half of the increase in engine maintenance expense was for aircraft  which is based on a time and materials basis 
expense for these aircraft engines increased because of an increase in repairs for these aircraft engines 
currently  the company expects an increase in maintenance materials and repairs expense per asm in first quarter  versus  due to the number of engine repairs scheduled 
agency commissions per asm decreased percent  primarily due to a decline in commissionable revenues 
the percentage of commissionable revenues decreased from approximately percent in to approximately percent in approximately percent of passenger revenues in were derived through the company s web site at www 
southwest 
com versus percent in in october  the company announced it would no longer pay commissions on travel agency sales effective december  this change in policy is expected to save the company approximately million in aircraft rentals per asm and depreciation expense per asm were both impacted by a higher percentage of the aircraft fleet being owned 
aircraft rentals per asm decreased percent while depreciation expense per asm increased percent 
the company owns all of the aircraft it put into service during this  along with the retirement of three owned and one leased aircraft  has increased the company s percentage of aircraft owned or on capital lease to percent at december   from percent at december  based on the company s scheduled capacity increases and aircraft financing plans  the company expects a decline in aircraft rental expense per asm in landing fees and other rentals per asm increased percent primarily as a result of higher space rental rates throughout the company s system 
during  many other major airlines reduced their flight capacity at airports served by the company 
since southwest did not reduce its flights  the company incurred higher airport costs based on a greater relative share of total flights and passengers 
other operating expenses per asm decreased percent 
approximately percent of the decrease was due to lower aviation insurance costs 
following the september terrorist attacks  commercial aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums and reduced the amount of war risk coverage available to commercial carriers 
the federal government stepped in to provide supplemental third party war risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers for renewable days periods  at substantially lower premiums than then prevailing commercial rates and for levels of coverage not available in the commercial market 
in november  congress passed the homeland security act of  which mandated the federal government provide third party  passenger  and hull war risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers through august   and which permitted such coverage to be extended by the government through december  the emergency wartime 
table of contents supplemental appropriations act see note to the consolidated financial statements extended the government s mandate to provide war risk insurance until august   and permits extensions until december  as a result of more coverage from government insurance programs and a more stable aviation insurance market  the company was able to negotiate lower aviation insurance premiums than however  aviation insurance remains substantially higher than before september  the majority of the remaining decrease in other operating expenses per asm was due to reductions in security costs from the transition of airport security to the federal government  and decreases in advertising and personnel related expenses 
as a result of recently concluded negotiations for commercial insurance coverage and the additional coverage provided by the government  the company currently expects other operating expenses per asm to decrease again  in other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense decreased million  or percent  compared to the prior year  primarily due to lower effective interest rates 
the company executed two interest rate swaps in second quarter to convert a portion of its fixed rate debt to a lower floating rate 
the company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its million senior unsecured notes due march  and million class a pass through certificates due november  see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s hedging activities 
excluding the effect of any new debt offerings the company may execute during  the company expects a decrease in interest expense compared to  due to the full year effect of the interest rate swaps  the october redemption of its million senior unsecured notes  and the scheduled redemption of the company s million aircraft secured notes on its due date in fourth quarter capitalized interest increased million  or percent  primarily as a result of higher progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries  compared to based on the company s current schedule of progress payments and aircraft deliveries  the company expects progress payment balances  and corresponding capitalized interest  to increase in compared to interest income decreased million  or percent  primarily due to a decrease in rates earned on short term investments 
other gains in and primarily resulted from government grants of million and million  respectively  received pursuant to the wartime and the stabilization acts 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these acts 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  decreased to percent in from percent in due to higher company earnings in and lower effective state income tax rates 
compared with the company s consolidated net income for was million 
per share  diluted  as compared to net income of million 
per share  diluted  a decrease of million or percent 
approximately percent of this decrease was due to the decrease in government grants that the company recognized under the stabilization act 
in and  the company recognized million pretax and million pretax in government grants under the stabilization act 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the remainder of the decrease primarily was due to the full year impact of the september  terrorist attacks on the company and the airline industry 
following the september  terrorist attacks  all us commercial flight operations were suspended for approximately three days 
however  the company continued to incur nearly all of its normal operating expenses with the exception of certain direct trip related expenditures such as fuel  landing fees  etc the company canceled approximately  flights before resuming flight operations on september after operations were fully resumed  load factors and passenger yields were severely depressed  and ticket refund activity increased 
in addition  operating expenses in areas 
table of contents such as aviation insurance and security related expenses were much higher than before 
from january through the end of august  the company had earned approximately million in operating income 
however  for september  it incurred operating losses of million  and for fourth quarter  operating income was million 
for the full year  operating income was million  a decrease of million  or percent compared to due to the full year impact the terrorist attacks had on airline industry revenue performance 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues decreased million from  or 
percent  primarily due to a million  or 
percent  decrease in passenger revenues 
the decrease in passenger revenues was primarily due to lower load factors attributable to the post september  reduction in demand for air travel 
the company s load factor for was percent  compared to percent for  resulting from a capacity asm increase of percent versus a traffic rpm increase of only percent 
the increase in asms was due to the net addition of aircraft during net of three aircraft retirements 
consolidated freight revenues decreased million  or percent  primarily due to a percent decrease in mail revenues 
following the terrorist attacks  the united states postal service shifted a significant portion of the mail that commercial carriers had previously carried to freight carriers 
the mail decrease more than offset an percent increase in other freight revenues 
other revenues increased million  or percent  primarily due to an increase in commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners  such as the company sponsored bank one visa card 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for increased million  or percent  compared to the percent increase in capacity

the majority of the increase in salaries and wages was due to headcount additions outpacing the company s capacity growth in several operational areas  due in part to additional security requirements at airports 
the remaining portion of the increase in salaries and wages per asm primarily was due to higher average wage rates 

table of contents the increase in benefits expense per asm primarily was due to higher health care costs

the company s and average jet fuel costs are net of approximately million and million in gains from hedging activities  respectively 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm decreased percent 
this decrease primarily was due to a decrease in airframe expense resulting from fewer outsourced heavy maintenance events versus more heavy maintenance events were performed internally in  resulting in the labor costs associated with those events being reflected in salaries and wages 
agency commissions per asm decreased percent  primarily due to a change in the company s commission rate policy 
effective october   the company reduced the commission paid to travel agents from eight percent for ticketless bookings and five percent for paper ticket bookings  to five percent  regardless of the type of ticket sold 
in addition  the mix of tickets sold through travel agents declined from percent of total revenues in to percent in  thereby reducing commissionable revenues and commission expense 
aircraft rentals per asm and depreciation expense per asm were both impacted by a higher percentage of the aircraft fleet being owned

the company owns all of the aircraft it put into service during this  along with the retirement of one owned and two leased aircraft in  increased the company s percentage of aircraft owned or on capital lease to percent at december   from percent at december  landing fees and other rentals per asm increased percent primarily as a result of airport rate increases throughout the company s system 
moreover  following the terrorist attacks  most other major airlines reduced their flight schedules due to the drop in air travel 
since southwest did not reduce its flights  the company incurred higher airport costs based on a greater relative share of total flights and passengers 
other operating expenses per asm decreased percent despite a per asm increase of more than percent in aviation insurance costs 
the insurance cost increases were more than offset through various cost control measures implemented immediately following the prior year terrorist attacks  including reductions in personnel related expenses and office expenses 
excluding insurance expense  other operating expenses per asm decreased percent 
following the terrorist attacks  commercial aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums and reduced the amount of war risk coverage available to commercial carriers 
the federal government then stepped in to provide supplemental third party war risk insurance coverage to commercial airlines  for renewable days periods  at substantially lower premiums than prevailing commercial rates during and for levels of coverage not available at that time in the commercial market 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses

table of contents in long term debt in the form of pass through certificates 
in first quarter  the company issued million in unsecured notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these two borrowings 
the increase in expense caused by these borrowings was partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on the company s floating rate debt and the july redemption of million of unsecured notes 
capitalized interest decreased million  or percent  primarily as a result of lower progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries  compared to interest income decreased million  or percent  as higher invested cash balances for the year were more than offset by lower rates 
other gains in and primarily resulted from million and million  respectively  received as the company s share of government grants under the stabilization act 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the stabilization act 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  increased to percent in from percent in  primarily due to the company s lower earnings in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was billion in compared to million in for the company  operating cash inflows are primarily derived from providing air transportation for customers 
the vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day in which travel is provided and  in some cases  several months before the anticipated travel date 
operating cash outflows are primarily related to the recurring expenses of operating the airline 
for  the increase in operating cash flows primarily was due to higher net income  largely attributable to the million government grant from the wartime act 
also contributing to the increase in operating cash flows was an increase in accrued liabilities and a decrease in accounts and other receivables 
the increase in accrued liabilities primarily was due to an increase in accrued profitsharing from higher earnings available for profitsharing 
the decrease in accounts and other receivables was primarily due to the collection of a million tax refund related to the tax year 
cash generated in and in was primarily used to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and provide working capital 
cash flows used in investing activities in totaled billion compared to million in investing activities in both years primarily consisted of payments for new aircraft delivered to the company and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries 
although the company received fewer new aircraft in new s versus new s  there was a substantial increase in progress payments for future deliveries compared to the prior year 
the increase in progress payments primarily was related to aircraft to be delivered in and during  the company accelerated the delivery for several aircraft from future years into  and exercised options for several and deliveries 
these decisions resulted in an acceleration of progress payments to the manufacturer related to the aircraft 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in cash used in financing activities during was primarily for the redemption of its million senior unsecured notes originally issued in this was mostly offset by proceeds of million from the exercise of employee stock options

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the company s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as air traffic liability 
passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided ie  when the flight takes place 
air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates 
the company s air traffic liability balance at december  was million 
estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded  exchanged  or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment 
the majority of the company s tickets sold are nonrefundable  which is the primary source of forfeited tickets 
according to the company s contract of carriage  tickets that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight  up to a year from the date of sale  or can be refunded if the ticket is refundable 
a small percentage of tickets or partial tickets expire unused 
fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited 
air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges  net of forfeitures for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed 
these estimates are based on historical experience over many years 
the company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel is provided 
estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the company s estimates with respect to forfeited tickets 
events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical customer travel patterns  as noted above  can result in actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts 
if actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range  estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to air traffic liability and to passenger revenue are recorded as necessary 
additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include  but may not be limited to  the company s refund and exchange policy  the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares  and promotional fare activity 
the company s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  actual refund and exchange activity may vary from estimated amounts 
furthermore  the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds  exchanges  and forfeited tickets would be reported 
table of contents based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
following september and through  the company experienced fluctuations in estimated refunds and exchanges  and correspondingly  forfeited tickets  due to many of the factors described above 
following the terrorist events of september   and the subsequent temporary shutdown of us air space  southwest temporarily suspended its normal refund policy in order to provide the highest service to the company s customers  including the refunding of nonrefundable tickets upon customer request 
as a result  the company experienced refunds during september and through december far above historical refund levels and in excess of the company s contractual obligations 
in evaluating passenger revenue through third quarter  based on these unusually high refund levels  the company estimated that approximately million of these refunds related to revenue previously recognized for estimated forfeited tickets 
as a result  the company reduced third quarter passenger revenue by million and restored air traffic liability  accordingly 
subsequent to third quarter and through second quarter  the company experienced a higher than historical mix of discount  nonrefundable ticket sales 
the company also experienced changes in customer travel patterns resulting from various factors  including new airport security measures  concerns about further terrorist attacks  and an uncertain economy 
consequently  the company recorded million in additional passenger revenue in second quarter as customers required fewer refunds and exchanges  resulting in more forfeited tickets 
during  refund  exchange  and forfeiture activity returned to more historic  pre september   patterns 
accounting for long lived assets as of december   the company had approximately billion of long lived assets  including billion in flight equipment and related assets 
in accounting for long lived assets  the company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
the following table shows a breakdown of the company s long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups estimated estimated useful life residual value aircraft and engines to years aircraft parts fleet life ground property and equipment to years leasehold improvements years or lease term the company s remaining s  due to be retired by first quarter  have residual values of in estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft  the company has primarily relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from boeing  the manufacturer of the company s aircraft 
aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown a cycle is one take off and landing 
the company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft 
subsequent revisions to these estimates  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to the company s 
table of contents maintenance program  changes in utilization of the aircraft actual cycles during a given period of time  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and  when warranted  adjusts these estimates and assumptions 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense  as required by gaap 
when appropriate  the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
while the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators  southwest has continued to operate all of its aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow 
consequently  the company has not identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet 
the company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment

the financial derivative instruments utilized by the company primarily were a combination of collars  purchased call options  and fixed price swap agreements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets 
since the majority of the company s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  the company estimates their fair values 
depending on the type of instrument  the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
also  since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel  the company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices  as required by sfas forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices such as crude oil and heating oil and adjusted based on historical variations to those like commodities 
fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle  and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed  respectively 
however  once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed  all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements 
based on these actual results once all values and prices become known  the company s estimates have proved to be materially accurate 
furthermore  since the majority of the company s hedges settle within to months from the time the company enters into the contract for the derivative financial instrument  the estimates being made are relatively short term 

table of contents estimating the fair value of these fuel hedging derivatives and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under sfas to the extent that the period to period change in the estimated fair value of a fuel hedging instrument differs from a period to period change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased  ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge will result  as defined by sfas this could result in the immediate recording of charges or income  even though the derivative instrument may not expire until a future period 
historically  the company has not experienced significant ineffectiveness in its fuel hedges accounted for under sfas sfas is a complex accounting standard with stringent requirements including the documentation of a company hedging strategy  statistical analysis to qualify a commodity for hedge accounting both on a historical and a prospective basis  and strict contemporaneous documentation that is required at the time each hedge is executed by the company 
as required by sfas  the company assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis 
the company also examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis utilizing statistical analysis 
this analysis involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses that compare changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities used for hedging purposes crude oil and heating oil 
the company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap agreements 
during second quarter  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its million senior unsecured notes due march   and million class a pass through certificates due november  under the first interest rate swap agreement  the company pays the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin every six months and receives every six months on a notional amount of million until march  under the second agreement  the company pays libor plus a margin every six months and receives every six months on a notional amount of million until november  the company s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges  as defined by sfas in addition  these interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method of accounting for hedges  as defined by sfas under the shortcut method  the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective  and thus  there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements  which are adjusted regularly  are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet  as necessary  with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the long term debt 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements  excluding accrued interest  at december   was a liability of approximately million 
this amount is recorded in other deferred liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
in accordance with fair value hedging  the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value of long term debt

forward looking statements some statements in this form k or otherwise made by the company or on the company s behalf from time to time in other reports  filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases  conferences  world wide web postings or otherwise which are not historical facts  may be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include statements about southwest s estimates  expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies for the future  and the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements 
southwest uses the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  forecasts  may  will  should  and similar expressions to identify these forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve 
table of contents risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or the company s present expectations 
factors that could cause these differences include  but are not limited to items directly linked to the september  terrorist attacks  such as the adverse impact of new airline and airport security directives on the company s costs and customer demand for travel  changes in the transportation security administration s scope for managing us airport security  the availability and cost of war risk and other aviation insurance  including the federal government s provision of third party war risk coverage  and the possibility of additional incidents that could cause the public to question the safety and or efficiency of air travel 
war or other military actions by the us or others 
competitive factors  such as fare sales and capacity decisions by the company and its competitors  changes in competitors flight schedules  mergers and acquisitions  codesharing programs  and airline bankruptcies 
general economic conditions  which could adversely affect the demand for travel in general and consumer ticket purchasing habits  as well as decisions by major freight customers on how they allocate freight deliveries among different types of carriers 
factors that could affect the company s ability to control its costs  such as the results of employee labor contract negotiations  employee hiring and retention rates  costs for health care  the largely unpredictable prices of jet fuel  crude oil  and heating oil  the continued effectiveness of the company s fuel hedges  changes in the company s overall fuel hedging strategy  capacity decisions by the company and its competitors  unscheduled required aircraft airframe or engine repairs and regulatory requirements  changes in commission policy  availability of capital markets  future financing decisions made by the company  and reliance on single suppliers for both the company s aircraft and its aircraft engines

caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the company s forward looking statements  which represent the company s views only as of the date this report is filed 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps  and has commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet 
the company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices  but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases 
the company also operates aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the 
table of contents company s accounting for its hedging program and note to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the company s financial derivative instruments 
fuel hedging 
the company utilizes its fuel hedges as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices 
the company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases 
the company expects to consume billion gallons of jet fuel in based on this usage  a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the company s fuel and oil expense by approximately million per year 
the fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december   were net assets of million 
the current portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  is classified as fuel hedge contracts in the consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  is included in other assets 
the fair values of the derivative instruments  depending on the type of instrument  were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
an immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december   prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately million 
changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects 
this sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at december   levels  except underlying futures prices 
financial market risk 
airline operators are inherently capital intensive as the vast majority of the company s assets are expensive aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to capitalize conservatively and grow capacity steadily and profitably 
while the company uses financial leverage  it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an a credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with standard poor s and fitch ratings agencies  and a baa credit rating with moody s rating agency 
the company s aircraft secured notes and french credit agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt 
in addition  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  during  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its million senior unsecured notes due march   and million class a pass through certificates due november  due to these transactions  the company considers these debts to also be at floating rates 
although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings  the risk for the aircraft secured notes and french credit agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt on any of the semi annual principal and interest payment dates 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the material terms of the company s short term and long term debt 
excluding the million senior unsecured notes that were converted to a floating rate as previously noted  the company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling million at december  these senior unsecured notes currently have a weighted average maturity of years at fixed rates averaging percent at december   which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years 
the fixed rate portion of the company s pass through certificates consists of its class a certificates and class b certificates  which totaled million at december  these class a and class b certificates had a weighted average maturity of years at fixed rates averaging percent at december  the carrying value of the company s floating rate debt totaled million  and this debt had a weighted average maturity of years at floating rates averaging percent at december  in total  
table of contents the company s fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented percent and percent  respectively  of total noncurrent assets at december  the company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash  which totaled billion at december  the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit  highly rated money markets  investment grade commercial paper  and other highly rated financial instruments 
because of the short term nature of these investments  the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
a change in market interest rates could  however  have a corresponding effect on the company s earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt  invested cash  and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items 
assuming floating market rates in effect as of december   were held constant throughout a month period  a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the company s net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than million 
utilizing these assumptions and considering the company s cash balance  short term investments  and floating rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in rates would have a net positive effect on the company s earnings and cash flows  while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
however  a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt 
the company is also subject to various financial covenants included in its credit card transaction processing agreement  the revolving credit facility  and outstanding debt agreements 
covenants included the maintenance of minimum credit ratings and minimum asset fair values 
the company met or exceeded the minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of december  however  if conditions change and the company failed to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreements  it could reduce the availability of cash under the agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact as written
