results of operations overview we develop  manufacture and market the invos cerebral oximeter  the only non invasive patient monitoring system commercially available in the united states that continuously measures changes in the blood oxygen level in the brain 
we also develop and market the correstore system for use in cardiac repair and reconstruction  including heart surgeries called surgical ventricular restoration  or svr 
in june  we entered into a license agreement for the correstore system 
in november we received clearance from the fda to market the correstore patch in the united states  and in april we met the requirements under the european medical device directive to use the ce mark  thereby allowing us to market the product in the european economic community 
during fiscal  our primary activities consisted of sales and marketing of the cerebral oximeter and related disposable somasensor 
during fiscal and  our primary activities consisted of sales and marketing of the cerebral oximeter  the related disposable somasensor  and the correstore system 
we derive our revenues from sales of cerebral oximeters  somasensors and correstore systems to our distributors and to hospitals in the united states through our direct sales employees and independent sales representative firms 
we offer to our customers in the united states a no cap sales program whereby we ship the cerebral oximeter to the customer at no charge  in exchange for the customer agreeing to purchase at a premium a minimum monthly quantity of somasensors 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  the product has been delivered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the product is considered delivered to the customer once we have shipped it  as this is when title and risk of loss have transferred 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days or longer for international sales 
our primary expenses  excluding the cost of our products  are selling  general and administrative and research  development and engineering 
as described in more detail below  we achieved our first year of profitability in fiscal  with net income of 
per common share 
our net income was primarily a result of a increase in net revenues  an increase in gross margin percentage  and the control of our operating expenses 
we have projected an increase in net revenues for fiscal of approximately to  and have projected net income per basic common share of approximately 
to 
we also expect our gross margin percentage to increase in fiscal fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  our net revenues increased approximately  or  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in united states sales of approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in sales of the disposable somasensor of approximately  or  and an increase in correstore system revenues of approximately  or  an increase in international sales of approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to increased purchases of the cerebral oximeter and disposable somasensor by tyco healthcare in europe and edwards lifesciences in japan  and a increase in the average selling price of somasensors in the united states  primarily as a result of the increase in the suggested retail price of the somasensor effective december   the addition of new customers during at the higher suggested retail prices  and increased sales of somasensors to larger us hospitals at a premium price pursuant to our no cap sales program 
this increase was partially offset by increased somasensor sales to international distributors  which have lower average selling prices 
sales of our products as a percentage of net revenues were as follows percent of net revenue fiscal year ended november  product somasensors cerebral oximeters correstore systems total approximately of our net revenues in fiscal were export sales  compared to approximately of our net revenues in fiscal one international distributor accounted for approximately of net revenues for each of the fiscal years ended november  and november  effective september   we increased the suggested list price for the adult somasensor and the pediatric somasensor in the united states to and  respectively 
in addition  we launched our new small adult somasensor  designed for use on patients with smaller foreheads or lower hairlines  with a suggested list price of 
although these prices may not apply to existing customers or to any existing sales quotations issued before september   we expect that the average selling price of somasensors in the united states will increase by approximately in fiscal  primarily as a result of the addition of new customers at our suggested retail prices  the preference of larger us hospitals to acquire the cerebral oximeter using our no cap sales program and  thereby  pay a premium price for the disposable somasensor  increased sales of our pediatric somasensor  which has a higher retail price than our adult somasensor  and increased sales of our new small adult somasensor 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately for the fiscal year ended november  and approximately for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to the increase in the average selling price of somasensors in the united states described above  increased sales of our latest model somasensor  which is less costly to manufacture than the prior model somasensor sold in fiscal  sales of our latest model cerebral oximeter  which was launched in  and is less costly to manufacture than the model sold in fiscal  and increased sales of the correstore system in fiscal we expect gross margins to increase in fiscal primarily as a result of increased average selling prices of the somasensor in the united states and expected reduced costs of manufacturing the somasensor 
our research  development and engineering expenses decreased approximately  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to approximately  in decreased costs associated with the development of the correstore system and approximately  in decreased costs associated with the development of the cerebral oximeter 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a  increase in commissions paid to our independent sales representative firms as a result of increased sales and additional independent representative firms  a  increase in incentive compensation expense due to increased sales  net income  and our executive officers receiving awards under the incentive compensation plan after forgoing awards under the incentive compensation plan  a  increase in salaries  wages  commissions and related expenses  primarily as a result of increased salaries  principally sales and marketing  and increased employee insurance costs  a  increase in trade show  promotional  and selling related expenses as a result of our increased sales and marketing activities  and a  increase in royalty expense due to increased sales of the correstore system 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal as a result of marketing and selling the cerebral oximeter and the correstore system 
fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  our net revenues increased approximately  or  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in united states sales of approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to a increase in sales of the disposable somasensor  and approximately  in correstore system revenues in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in sales of the cerebral oximeter primarily as a result of approximately  in stocking orders to independent representatives in fiscal  and also partly as a result of a preference by larger us hospitals to acquire cerebral oximeters using our no cap sales program  and a increase in the average selling price of somasensors primarily as a result of the increase from the prior year in the suggested retail price of the somasensor effective september   and a change in the sales mix between sales in the united states  which have higher average selling prices  and sales to international distributors 
the increase in net revenues was achieved despite a decrease in international sales of approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to decreased purchases by tyco healthcare in fiscal sales of our products as a percentage of net revenues were as follows percent of net revenue fiscal year ended november  product somasensors cerebral oximeters correstore systems total approximately of our net revenues in fiscal were export sales  compared to approximately of our net revenues in fiscal one international distributor accounted for approximately of net revenues for the fiscal year ended november   and approximately of net revenues for the fiscal year ended november  effective december   we increased the suggested list price for the adult somasensor and the pediatric somasensor in the united states to and  respectively 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately for the fiscal year ended november  and approximately for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to a increase in the average selling price of somasensors  described above  increased sales of our latest model somasensor  which is less costly to manufacture than the prior model somasensor  sales of the correstore system in fiscal  and a change in sales mix with increased sales in the united states and decreased sales to international distributors which have lower average selling prices 
our research  development and engineering expenses decreased approximately  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to approximately  in decreased costs associated with the development of the correstore system and a  decrease in engineering salaries as a result of one less engineer  partially offset by approximately  in increased costs associated with the development of our next generation cerebral oximeter 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a  increase in commissions paid to our independent sales representative firms   in customer education expenses for the correstore system in fiscal  a  increase in trade show expenditures for the cerebral oximeter and correstore system as a result of our increased sales and marketing activities  a  increase in insurance expense  primarily due to increased products liability insurance coverage since we began marketing the correstore system  and a  increase in professional service fees  primarily due to the timing of auditing and tax service expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in intangible amortization expense as a result of discontinued amortization of license acquisition costs in connection with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  a  termination fee paid in fiscal related to the kingsbridge capital limited private equity line  a  decrease in salaries  wages  commissions and related expenses  primarily as a result of a reduction in the number of employees  principally sales and marketing from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  and reduced employee sales commissions  and  paid in fiscal in connection with the loan and security agreement with crestmark bank 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations in the past three years 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operations during fiscal was approximately  cash was used primarily to increase accounts receivable by approximately  primarily as a result of higher fourth quarter sales than fourth quarter sales  and increase inventory by approximately  primarily due to the acquisition of components associated with our somasensor and cerebral oximeter due to anticipated sales  partially offset by a reduction in correstore inventory 
these uses of cash were partially offset by our net income  approximately  before depreciation and amortization expense  a  increase in accounts payable  primarily due to increased inventories and the increased sales commissions payable to our independent sales representative firms described above  and a  increase in accrued liabilities  primarily as a result of the increased accrued incentive compensation described above and increased sales commissions to our direct sales employees as a result of higher sales  partially offset by a reduction in accrued training and clinical research expenses from we expect our working capital requirements to increase as sales increase 
we capitalized approximately  of costs for cerebral oximeters being used as demonstration units and no cap units during fiscal  compared to approximately  in fiscal as of november   we have capitalized approximately  in costs for cerebral oximeters being used as demonstration and no cap units  and these assets have a net book value of approximately  we depreciate these costs over five years 
capital expenditures in fiscal were approximately  these expenditures were primarily approximately  for cerebral oximeters being used as demonstration units and no cap units  and approximately  in tooling costs  primarily for the somasensor 
our principal sources of operating funds have been the proceeds of equity investments from sales of our common shares 
see statements of shareholders equity of our financial statements included in item of this report 
on march   we entered into the private equity line agreement with kingsbridge capital limited  a private institutional investor 
we completed the sales of  common shares under the private equity line agreement  for gross proceeds of  through december  our net proceeds  after deducting the commissions and the estimated expenses of the offerings  were approximately  on april   we mutually agreed with kingsbridge to terminate the private equity line agreement  the related registration rights agreement  and kingsbridge s right to the discount on any unsold shares  in exchange for our payment of  to kingsbridge 
in connection with the private equity line agreement  we issued to kingsbridge capital warrants which entitled the holder to purchase  common shares  after adjustment for the april private placement and the january public offering  at a purchase price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable at any time until september  the warrants contain standard provisions that protect the holder against dilution by adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares issuable pursuant to the warrants if various events occur 
the exercise price of the warrants is payable either in cash or by a cashless exercise 
in november  kingsbridge purchased  common shares under the warrants by a cashless exercise 
as a result of this cashless exercise  we issued  common shares to kingsbridge  retaining  common shares in payment of the exercise price  and kingsbridge s warrants now entitle it to purchase  more common shares 
on february   we entered into a loan and security agreement with crestmark bank for a working capital line of credit for up to  collateralized by all of our assets 
we paid a  commitment fee for the loan 
as of april   we amended our loan and security agreement with crestmark bank 
pursuant to the amendment  we paid a  renewal commitment fee to continue our lending relationship for the remainder of through november   we had borrowed an aggregate of  under the agreement and repaid  in principal amount through crestmark s collection of our receivables and by using some of the proceeds from our april  and january  offerings 
no amounts were borrowed under this facility in fiscal effective december   our loan and security agreement with crestmark bank expired 
we do not intend to renew this lending agreement 
on april   we completed the private placement of  newly issued common shares at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of  our estimated net proceeds  after deducting the placement agent s commission and the expenses of the offering  were approximately  brean murray co  inc was our exclusive placement agent for the offering and received for its services  as a placement agent fee  and warrants to purchase  common shares at per share exercisable during the four year period beginning april   with the exercise price of the warrants payable either in cash or by a cashless exercise 
in addition  the brean murray co  inc profit sharing plan purchased  common shares in the offering  and robert r 
henry  one of our directors  purchased  common shares in the offering 
in october  brean murray co  inc transferred the  warrants to persons who are or were employees of brean murray co  inc  and in november  those persons exercised the warrants to purchase all  common shares under the warrants by a cashless exercise 
as a result of this cashless exercise  we issued  restricted common shares to those individuals  retaining  common shares in payment of the exercise price  and no more common shares remain subject to these warrants 
on january   we completed the public offering of  newly issued common shares at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of  our estimated net proceeds  after deducting the placement agent s commission and the estimated expenses of the offering  were approximately  brean murray co  inc was our exclusive placement agent for the offering and received for its services  as a placement agent fee  and warrants to purchase  common shares at per share exercisable during the four year period beginning january  during fiscal  we issued  common shares as a result of stock option exercises by employees  directors and former employees  for proceeds of approximately  as of november   we had working capital of  cash and cash equivalents of  total current liabilities of  and shareholders equity of  we had an accumulated deficit of  through november  we expect that our primary needs for liquidity in fiscal will be to fund our operations  including funding for marketing costs for the cerebral oximeter and the correstore system  and research and development efforts related to the advancement of the design and production processes of the cerebral oximeter and somasensor  and for working capital  primarily accounts receivable  as our sales increase 
in addition  we have budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures during fiscal  primarily for new demonstration and no cap equipment 
we believe that the cash and cash equivalents on hand at november  will be adequate to satisfy our operating and capital requirements for more than the next twelve months 
the estimated length of time current cash and cash equivalents will sustain our operations is based on estimates and assumptions we have made 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to change as a result of actual experience 
actual funding requirements necessary to market the cerebral oximeter  the disposable somasensor  and the correstore system  to undertake other product development activities  and for working capital might be substantially greater than current estimates 
our ability to use our accumulated net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income  if any  for income tax purposes  is limited due to the initial public offering of our securities in march see note of notes to financial statements included in item of this report 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement  which is effective for fiscal years ending after december   amends statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  statement no 
amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
regardless of the accounting method used to account for stock based compensation 
we have chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation of employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
however  we adopted the enhanced disclosure provisions as defined by statement no 
beginning with our fiscal quarter ended february  during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the adoption of this interpretation had no impact on our financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the adoption of eitf had no impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe our most significant accounting policies relate to the recording of an intangible asset for license acquisition costs related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories  and our accounting treatment of stock options issued to employees 
in fiscal years   and  we recorded an intangible asset related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories 
license acquisition costs include our estimate of the fair value of ten year vested stock options to purchase common shares granted to one of our then current directors in connection with negotiating and assisting us in completing the transaction  and our estimate of the fair value of the vested portion of five year warrants to purchase common shares issued in the transaction 
we estimated the value of the stock options to purchase common shares and the warrants to purchase common shares using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation model requires the following assumptions expected life period of the security  expected volatility of our stock price during the period  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield 
given the assumptions inherent in the black scholes valuation model  it is possible to calculate a different value for our intangible asset by changing one or more of the valuation model variables or by using a different valuation model 
however  we believe that the model is appropriate  that the judgments and assumptions that we have made at the time of valuation were also appropriate  and that the reported results would not be materially different had one or more of the variables been different or had a different valuation model been used 
in addition  effective december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the effect of adopting this statement has been to discontinue amortizing our license acquisition costs related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories described above because we believe these licenses have an indefinite life 
therefore  we recorded no amortization expense related to these license acquisition costs in fiscal or for fiscal  we incurred amortization expense of approximately  associated with these license acquisition costs 
our net loss for fiscal  excluding the effect of amortizing our license acquisition costs  would have been reduced to approximately  or 
per common share 
it is possible to determine a different life for these licenses  and if they had a definite life we would amortize the intangible asset over the remaining useful life 
however  we believe it is appropriate to use an indefinite life for these licenses 
in october  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  was issued by the financial accounting standards board 
in addition  as described above  in december  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  was issued by the financial accounting standards board  and amends statement no 
we have chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation of employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation costs for stock options granted to employees are measured as the excess  if any  of the market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
no compensation expense has been charged against income for stock option grants to employees because our stock option grants are priced at the market value as of the date of grant 
during fiscal  we granted  stock options to our employees and directors  in fiscal we granted  stock options to our employees and directors  and in fiscal we granted  stock options to our employees and directors 
had we recognized compensation expense for our stock options granted to employees in fiscal  based on the fair value of the options on the grant date pursuant to the methodology of sfas no 
 we would have recorded approximately  in compensation expense and incurred a pro forma net loss of approximately  or 
per fully diluted common share 
had we recognized compensation expense for stock options granted to employees in fiscal and  our net loss  on a pro forma basis  would have increased by approximately  or 
per common share  in fiscal  and increased by approximately  or 
per common share  in fiscal contractual obligations the following information is provided as of november  with respect to our known contractual obligations specified in the following table  aggregated by type of contractual obligation payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations    purchase obligations   other long term liabilities purchase obligations consist primarily of purchase orders executed for inventory components
