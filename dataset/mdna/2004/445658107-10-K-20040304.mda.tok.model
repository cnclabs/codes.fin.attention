item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see forward looking statements and risk factors for a discussion of items  uncertainties  assumptions and risks associated with these statements 
executive summary we are one of the largest truck load transportation and logistics companies in north america 
our business operations are primarily organized through three business segments 
our jbt segment typically picks up freight loaded in trailers at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transports a complete truck load directly to the consignee 
jbt utilizes primarily company controlled tractors or ics and transports freight over highway routes 
jbi freight is usually loaded in containers and picked up at a shipper s location by company controlled tractors or designed third party dray companies and transported to railroad yards 
this intermodal container is then transferred from highway vehicles chassis and stacked on rail cars for what is typically the longest leg of the route 
at the destination rail yard  jbi freight is removed from the rail car  remounted on a chassis and moved to the final destination by company controlled tractors or dray carriers 
dcs segment operations vary significantly by individual customer account 
a dcs account may involve a limited number of tractors  drivers and trailing equipment or may include a large fleet 
the specific services offered frequently range from typical freight transportation to labor intensive deliveries  freight handling and other specialized services 
we separated our jbt and jbi segment business effective january  we contributed our jbl business to a newly formed  associated logistics company in july in late  we established goals to improve the operating margins of each of our three segments 
our financial results for calendar year represented the second consecutive year of record revenues and earnings  driven by strong performance from each of our segments 
our financial results for were impacted by a number of items 
we implemented a driver pay per diem plan in february under this plan  a portion of certain road driver s pay is designated as reimbursement of expense 
this designation provides benefits both to our driver and to the business 
although the driver per diem plan increased our effective income tax rate  it reduced our total segment operating costs 
during  we also continued to focus on a process we call yield management 
yield management is a continuous process of reviewing our freight to determine whether business which is generating low or negative margins can be replaced by different business with better margins 
management actions may also involve price changes to ensure that we are charging for all services provided 
these price and freight mix actions favorably impacted a number of our key segment operating statistics shown in the following tables  particularly revenue per loaded mile and revenue per tractor per week 
our yield management activities also significantly contributed to our improved margins in  particularly in our jbt and dcs segments 
we also placed special emphasis during on dray costs and equipment utilization in our jbi segment 
we were able to increase the average number of loads that our drivers moved by creating pay incentives that rewarded productivity 
we also improved our box turns  or what we call velocity  which is the average number of loads moved by each container each month 
this continued focus allowed us to reduce our jbi segment operating ratio to in from in and in another area of management focus during was maintenance and revenue equipment 
we reduced the average age of our tractor fleet to years at december  from years at the end of we also converted a portion of our maintenance work to our company controlled facilities from third party owned shops 
the combination of the newer tractor fleet and conversion to our facilities reduced overall maintenance costs in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and associated disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following workers compensation and accident costs we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers compensation  vehicular collisions and accidents and cargo claims 
most insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim  but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured 
the amounts of self insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates 
during  we were self insured for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss  personal injury  property damage  workers compensation and health claims for amounts up to the first million of each claim 
in january  we changed our level of self insurance to million for auto accidents and million for workers compensation 
our claims accrual policy for all self insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as legal  economic and regulatory factors 
our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim 
the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature  timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available 
accordingly  we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability 
this process involves the use of loss development factors based on our historical claims experience 
in doing so  the recorded ultimate liability considers future claims growth and provides an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
we do not discount our estimated losses 
we are also substantially self insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 
at december   we had approximately million of estimated net claims payable 
in addition  we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums 
at december   we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately million  which represented pre funded claims and premiums 
revenue equipment we operate a significant number of tractors  trailers and containers in connection with our business 
this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements 
in addition  we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under short term rental arrangements 
revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or trade in value 
equipment acquired under capital leases is initially recorded at the net present value of the minimum lease payments and amortized on the straight line method over the lease term or the estimated useful life  whichever is shorter 
we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for guaranteed residual or trade in values for certain new equipment acquired since during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the useful lives and salvage values of our tractor fleet 
we have utilized the guaranteed trade in values as well as other operational information  such as anticipated annual miles  in accounting for purchased and leased tractors 
these changes in useful lives and salvage values increased net earnings during the fourth quarter of by approximately  if our tractor supplier was unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for guaranteed trade in values  it could have a materially negative impact on our financial results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported 
accordingly  a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 
segments we operated three segments during calendar year the operation of each of these businesses is described in footnote 
the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment 
operating revenue by segment for years ended december in millions of dollars jbt jbi dcs other subtotal inter segment eliminations total operating income by segment for years ended december in millions of dollars jbt jbi dcs other total operating data by segment for years ended december jbt operating ratio total loads revenue excl

fuel surcharge per tractor per week average number of tractors during the period tractors at end of period average effective trailing equipment usage reflects average use of corporate wide trailing equipment results of operations compared with overview of our consolidated net earnings for calendar year totaled a record million  after reversing million of non cash tax benefits  which resulted from a sale and leaseback transaction on intermodal trailing equipment 
this compares with our previous record net earnings of million in diluted earnings per share were in  also a record number  compared with cents in the average number of diluted shares outstanding in was approximately higher than the comparable number in consolidated operating revenues were billion in  an increase of over the billion in each of our business segments contributed to our improved financial results in while the overall economy and level of freight activity were not particularly strong during  a number of factors contributed to our improved level of earnings 
we have continued our focus on yield management  as well as individual load and lane profitability 
a number of new proprietary technology tools and increased management focus have allowed us to reduce the amount of unprofitable lanes and freight  and to properly charge for equipment and services provided to customers 
in addition  significant increases in certain operating costs  such as insurance  fuel and equipment  have reduced the level of capacity available in the industry 
jbt segment jbt segment gross revenue was million in  up over the million in higher fuel prices in and the resulting increase in fuel surcharge revenue accounted for this entire level of revenue growth 
the average tractor count in was down nearly from however  revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharges  rose in the current year  more than offsetting the decline in the size of the fleet and enhancing operating income 
operating income of the jbt segment rose to million in  from million in in addition to the higher revenue per mile  we implemented an accountable expense reimbursement plan driver per diem plan in early this new plan benefited most of our eligible drivers and increased operating income 
jbi segment jbi segment gross revenue grew by  to million in  from million in revenue growth was due  in part  to a strong demand for our unique intermodal service offering which generated an increase in number of loads year over year 
freight mix changes also played an important role that led to improved revenue per load 
operating income in the jbi segment increased to million in from million in the jbi segment operating ratio improved by basis points to for  compared to for these improved financial results were attributable to our investment in upgrading our tractor fleet and adding incremental containers  improved utilization of both drivers and equipment and a concentrated focus on yield management and revenue quality 
dcs segment dcs segment revenue grew over to million in from in revenue net of purchased transportation and fuel surcharge revenue increased 
the increase in revenue occurred even as the business unit s average tractor count for declined nearly  compared to more than offsetting the decline in the tractor fleet was a nearly improvement in revenue excluding fuel surcharge per tractor per day 
driving this increase in productivity was an increase in length of haul of and increased focus on backhaul opportunities 
operating income increased to million in versus million in at the end of  we began analyzing a number of underperforming accounts and identified opportunities to redeploy assets from accounts that did not offer appropriate financial returns on the segment s assets 
at the same time  cost controls were implemented to improve operating results at all accounts 
the success of these efforts improved the operating ratio by basis points  to in cost reductions in driver pay  salary and office wages and associated payroll taxes also enhanced operating income 
a decline of in the average age of the tractor fleet helped reduce maintenance costs and an ongoing commitment to safety contributed to an improvement in the segment s insurance and claims costs 
we also incurred certain new start up costs in associated with several large accounts that did not impact revenue growth will continue to be driven by improvement in productivity and new customer opportunities that provide appropriate financial returns to justify commitment of additional assets 
the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 
percentage of operating revenue percentage change between years vs 
operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits rents and purchased transportation fuel and fuel taxes depreciation and amortization operating supplies and expenses insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses general and administrative expenses  net of gains communication and utilities total operating expenses operating income interest expense equity in loss of associated companies earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings consolidated operating expenses total operating expenses increased in over  while operating revenues increased 
the combination of the change in these two categories resulted in our operating ratio improving by basis points to in  from in as previously mentioned  increases in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharges  and the implementation of a driver per diem plan were two of the more significant factors driving these changes 
we also increased the number of independent contractors ics in our jbt fleet to at december  from at the end of when we replace company operated tractors and driver employees with ics  certain costs such as salaries  wages  employee benefits and fuel are reduced and other costs such as purchased transportation increase 
fuel cost per gallon was approximately higher in over however  we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to adjust charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change 
if fuel costs change rapidly we may experience some financial impact from timing differences between financial reporting periods when fuel costs change more quickly than our compensating fuel surcharges 
we recovered through our fuel surcharge programs substantially all of the increased fuel costs experienced in calendar year we currently have no contracts or derivative programs in place to hedge changes in fuel costs 
insurance and claims costs rose during  primarily due to higher premium costs 
while our accident frequency declined in  severity  or the cost per accident  increased over general and administrative expenses include driver recruiting and testing  bad debts and professional service fees  all of which increased in gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions are also classified in the general and administrative category 
we had a net loss of approximately million on equipment and other dispositions in  compared with a million loss in these losses were primarily a result of revenue equipment which was lost or written off 
our net interest expense declined to million in  from million in we were able to reduce our total debt levels to million as of december   from million at the end of this reduced debt level was primarily a result of improved earnings and cash flow in and proceeds from a secondary stock offering which closed in mid our effective income tax rate increased to in  from in this higher tax rate was primarily due to our increased level of earnings  the driver per diem plan and a reversal of a million non cash tax benefit taken in related to certain sale leaseback transactions that closed in as previously mentioned  we implemented a driver per diem pay plan in early this plan generates net benefits to most of our eligible drivers and to the company 
however  it does result in an increase in our effective income tax rate 
the million reversal of tax benefits was retroactive to january   and related to a proposed adjustment by the internal revenue service that would disallow the tax benefits associated with a series of sale and leaseback transactions  which occurred in in addition to the reversal of tax benefits recorded in  we have suspended the recognition of any future tax benefits effective january  this issue is discussed in further detail under risk factors 
the equity in loss of associated company item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results for transplace  inc tpi 
effective january   we increased our interest in tpi to approximately  from in jbht s financial exposure is limited to its approximate million investment in tpi since we have not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of tpi s financial obligations 
compared with overview of our consolidated net earnings for calendar year were million  or diluted earnings per share of cents  compared with full year earnings of million  or cents per diluted share 
we generated million of operating income in  a nearly increase over the million of operating income in our operating ratio was in and in our increase in net earnings was in spite of an effective income tax rate which rose to from in and the number of diluted shares outstanding increasing by nearly 
the increase in shares outstanding reflected a secondary public offering  which closed in june each of our three segments contributed to the improved earnings levels in jbt segment jbt segment gross revenue was essentially flat  totaling million in and million in however  revenues were generated with approximately fewer tractors 
in addition  fuel surcharge revenues were million lower than the comparable amount in  which negatively impacted the revenue comparison by approximately 
truck segment operating income rose to million in  from million in the improvement in operating income reflected higher revenue per loaded mile  reduced empty miles and lower driver pay rates 
a significant portion of the higher revenue per loaded mile and reduced empty miles was a result of our continued focus on yield management and improved revenue quality 
a reduction in driver pay per mile was primarily a result of changes in pay scales for newly hired drivers 
jbi segment jbi segment gross revenue grew to million in  from million in revenue growth was due  in part  to continued demand for our intermodal service offering and conversion of our container fleet to solely foot units 
operating income in the jbi segment rose to million in from million in our jbi operating ratio was in and in financial results in this segment were enhanced by improved container utilization  improved driver productivity and a focus on revenue quality 
dcs segment dcs segment revenue grew nearly to million in  from million in revenue growth was primarily a result of a increase in the size of the dcs tractor fleet and our focus on improving the quality of individual fleets 
while operating income rose to million in from million in  the segment s operating ratio was in and in we reduced some costs in the dcs segment  such as driver pay and overhead  however  higher accident and claims expenses  as well as new account start up costs  more than offset the improvements 
the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 
percentage of operating revenue percentage change between years vs 
operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits rents and purchased transportation fuel and fuel taxes depreciation and amortization operating supplies and expenses insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses general and administrative expenses  net of gains communication and utilities total operating expenses operating income interest expense equity in loss of associated companies earings before income taxes income taxes net earnings consolidated operating expenses total operating expenses in increased over  while operating revenues rose 
our operating ratio improved to in  compared with in salaries  wages and employee benefits expense increased in  and declined to of revenue in from in as previously mentioned  a lower mileage pay rate in our jbt segment for newly hired drivers and the use of additional independent contractors were primary contributors to the relationship of this cost category to operating revenues 
partly offsetting a decline in drivers wages relative to revenue were increases in maintenance wages  workers compensation  health insurance and office employee incentive expenses 
we opened some new company managed maintenance facilities and increased our mechanic labor force by about in order to reduce the amount of maintenance that we outsource 
we also experienced higher costs in workers compensation and other fringe benefit programs and paid additional incentive payments to our office and administrative personnel that resulted from improved net earnings 
rents and purchased transportation expense increased  primarily due to the growth of our jbi business segment and the related payments to railroads and drayage carriers and the use of more independent contractors 
the decline in fuel and fuel tax expense was primarily a result of fuel costs per gallon averaging about less vs 
operating supplies and expenses were down in  reflecting the reduced amount of outsourced tractor and trailer maintenance work and our focus on reducing travel expenses 
the increase in insurance and claims costs reflects escalating liability insurance premiums that have been experienced industry wide and our higher accident costs 
the significant increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher driver advertising and recruiting expense in and changes in our gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions 
in  we had a million net loss on equipment and facility dispositions  compared with a net gain of million in our net interest expense declined in  partly due to the approximate million of capital we raised through a secondary public offering of common stock which closed in june we increased our effective income tax rate to in  from in  primarily to reflect additional taxes associated with our increased earnings 
equity in losses of associated companies reflects our share of operating results for tpi and for our mexican joint venture 
amounts included the following years ended december tpi mexican joint venture the year financial results of our mexican joint venture primarily reflect adjustments to the carrying value of the investment due to the anticipated sale of our interests 
during the first quarter of  we sold our joint venture interest in mexico for its carrying value  to the majority owner  transportacion maritima mexicana tmm 
we recorded an million note receivable from tmm  which  according to the terms of the sale  was to be paid in four annual payments of approximately million  plus interest at per annum  through june in june  we agreed to extend the principal payment to june we have received interest payments within the terms of the renegotiated note 
we are accounting for interest income on a cash basis and have a note receivable of million as of december  the next principal and interest payment is due in june liquidity and capital resources cash flow we generate significant amounts of cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in the significant changes in trade accounts payable which appear on our consolidated statements of cash flows for and were partly a result of timing differences among years of insurance related items 
cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment 
during the latter part of  through late  we utilized capital leases to acquire tractors 
tractor additions since october have been purchased 
in late  we began purchasing tractors that were under capital lease programs at the end of the initial lease term 
we paid approximately million in residual values for tractors under lease arrangements that terminated in and anticipate purchasing the remaining leased tractors for approximately million in in december  we purchased approximately million of intermodal trailing equipment that had been under an operating lease program 
the majority of trailing equipment additions during and were under operating lease agreements 
these lease agreements mature over a four year period beginning in and ending in since march  predominately all trailing equipment additions have been purchased 
the million of outstanding notes are due in september  and the final million of subordinated notes are due in october we anticipate that our current cash balance  cash flow generated from operations during the year and unused revolving lines of credit will be sufficient to retire this debt as it comes due 
by the end of  we anticipate that our only remaining obligations will consist primarily of operating leases for trailing equipment 
selected balance sheet data as of december working capital ratio current maturities of long term debt and lease obligations millions total debt and capitalized lease obligations millions total debt to equity total debt as a percentage of total capital from time to time  our board of directors authorizes the repurchase of our common stock 
however  we have not repurchased any of our common stock since liquidity our need for capital typically has resulted from the acquisition of revenue equipment required to support our growth and the replacement of older revenue equipment with new  late model equipment 
we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions 
we have recently obtained capital through a secondary common stock offering  revolving lines of credit and cash generated from operations 
we have also utilized capital and operating leases to acquire revenue equipment 
as mentioned above  we utilized capital leases to acquire tractors from late through late since late  we have been acquiring tractors and trailing equipment under purchase arrangements and plan to continue purchasing our revenue equipment in the foreseeable future 
we currently are committed to spend in the range of million  net of expected proceeds from sale or trade in allowances  on revenue equipment for and believe our current cash on hand  cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit will provide sufficient funds 
we are authorized to borrow up to million under our current revolving lines of credit  which expire november  we had no balances outstanding under these lines at december   and also no outstanding balances at the end of under the terms of our credit and note agreements  we are required to maintain certain financial covenants  including leverage tests  minimum tangible net worth tests  and other financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december  also  our revolving lines of credit do not contain ratings triggers that would accelerate payments or amounts due under the agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements all of our leases related to tractors have been accounted for as capital leases and are carried on our balance sheet 
our only off balance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment  which are described above 
as of december   we had approximately  trailers and  containers chassis that were operated subject to operating leases  and we had approximately million of obligations remaining under these leases 
our standby letters of credit are also not recorded on our books at december   since there were no balances outstanding at that time under these arrangements 
contractual cash obligations as of december  amounts due by period total one year or less one to three years four to five years after five years operating leases capital leases senior and subordinated notes payable subtotal commitments to acquire revenue equipment total financing commitments as of december  commitments expiring by period total one year or less one to three years four to five years after five years revolving credit arrangements standby letters of credit total risk factors our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on the results of our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  excess capacity in the trucking industry  surpluses in the market for used equipment  interest rates  fuel taxes  license and registration fees  insurance premiums  self insurance levels  and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors 
we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing  where we have a significant concentration of customers 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss  and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses 
in addition  our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season  and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather  which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry 
numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers 
some of these factors include we compete with many other truck load carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with less than truck load carriers and railroads  some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do 
many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins 
many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved transportation service providers  and in some instances we may not be selected 
many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors 
the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size 
advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
for the calendar year ended december   our top ten customers  based on revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue 
our largest customer is wal mart stores  inc  which accounted for approximately of our total revenue in generally  we do not have long term contracts with our customers  and we cannot assure you that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 
our intermodal business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services 
these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads 
while we have agreements with various class i railroads  the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe railway and the norfolk southern railroad 
the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in addition  a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts 
difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 
periodically  the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors 
if we are unable to continue to attract drivers or contract with independent contractors  we could be required to adjust our driver compensation package or let trucks sit idle  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 
our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
during  we self insured for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss  personal injury  property damage  workers compensation and health claims for amounts up to the first million of each claim 
in january  we changed our level of self insurance to million for auto accidents and million for workers compensation 
if the number or severity of claims for which we are self insured increases  our operating results could be adversely affected 
also  we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self insure with licensed insurance companies 
insurance carriers have recently raised premiums for most trucking companies 
as a result  our insurance and claims expenses could increase when our current coverage expires on july   or we could be required to raise our self insured retention 
if these expenses increase  and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
the internal revenue service irs has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain sale and leaseback transactions 
in  we entered into a series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of a portion of our intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price of approximately million 
this transaction was recently examined by the irs in an audit of our and income tax returns  and on december   we received a revenue agent s report summarizing adjustments proposed by the irs arising from this audit 
the irs proposes to disallow the tax benefits associated with this transaction based on their interpretation of existing tax laws and court precedents 
we believe this transaction conforms with the applicable tax law  and we intend to vigorously defend against the irs position using all administrative and legal processes available 
we have received the irs notice of proposed assessment and  as a result  we have filed an appeal in the matter 
if a resolution of the matter cannot be reached in the appeals process  the irs will forward a day letter  also known as a notice of deficiency 
a resolution of the dispute could occur at any point in this procedure or could extend through a trial and court appeals 
after receiving the irs notice of proposed assessment  applicable accounting literature dictated that we reverse all of the expected non cash tax benefits of approximately million and cease any further recognition of the benefit 
there is no impact on the benefits taken in prior years  however  if we are unsuccessful in defending this transaction  we could owe additional taxes and interest 
we estimate our maximum earnings exposure to be million  which represents the tax benefits realized through december   plus estimated accrued interest through december  this exposure would result if the irs succeeded in disallowing of the tax benefits from this transaction 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials  underground fuel storage tanks  and discharge and retention of storm water 
we operate in industrial areas  where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located  and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage  and hazardous wastes disposal  among others 
we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
we operate in a highly regulated industry  and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
the us department of transportation dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service  equipment operation  safety and financial reporting 
we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety  hours of service and other rules and regulations 
if we were found to be out of compliance  the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 
effective january   the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa  an administration within the dot  changed the regulations that govern driver hours of service 
these new rules generally allow a driver to drive for up to consecutive hours  rather than  but require hours of off duty time  rather than in addition  more off duty sleeper berth time is required before on duty time is allowed 
these new rules could increase our operating costs or reduce our equipment utilization 
as part of a consent decree with the us environmental protection agency epa  a number of heavy duty diesel engine manufacturers agreed to significantly reduce emissions from their engines produced subsequent to october  in november  we committed to purchase approximately  new tractors  primarily for our jbi and dcs segments  that were equipped with mercedes engines 
these engines were not covered by the epa s october  rules 
in late  we commenced receiving tractors with the new engines 
while the initial cost of these reduced emission engines is somewhat higher  we have not yet determined their impact on operating costs such as maintenance and fuel economy 
the epa has issued additional engine operating limitations that are scheduled to apply in fuel and fuel taxes currently represent our third largest general expense category 
during the past three years  fuel cost per gallon has varied significantly  with prices frequently changing as much as 
to 
per gallon between consecutive months 
we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers  which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs 
most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel 
however  there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers 
in addition  we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold weather and empty or out of route miles that cannot be billed to customers 
rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a materially adverse effect on our operations or future profitability 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
we have a million note receivable from transportacion maritima mexicana tmm related to the sale of our share of a mexican joint venture 
during the first quarter of  we sold our joint venture interest in mexico to tmm 
in accordance with the original terms of the sale  we recorded an million note receivable  which was to be paid in four annual payments of approximately million  plus interest 
in june  we agreed to extend the principal payment to june we are accounting for interest income on a cash basis and have a note receivable of million as of december  the next principal and interest payment is due in june recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
statement required us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the assets 
we also were required to record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation should be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
we adopted statement on january  the adoption of statement did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no

as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations
