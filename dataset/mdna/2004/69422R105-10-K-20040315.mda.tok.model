item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of pacific energy partners  lp  the successor to pacific energy predecessor as defined below  should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto set forth elsewhere in this report 
the discussion set forth in this section pertains to the consolidated financial position  statements of income and statements of cash flows of  as well as equity investment in  the partnership and its ownership interest in pacific energy group llc peg  whose subsidiaries consist of i pacific pipeline system llc pps  owner of line and the line system  ii pacific marketing and transportation llc pmt  owner of the pmt gathering and blending system  iii pacific terminals llc pt  owner of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system acquired on july   iv rocky mountain pipeline system llc rmps  owner of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems  and arepi pipeline  and v ranch pipeline llc rpl  the owner of a partnership interest in frontier pipeline company  a wyoming general partnership frontier 
prior to july   the date of the partnership s initial public offering  the financial data and results of operations for pps  pmt  rmps and rpl  are presented on a combined basis and constitute the predecessor 
overview we are a publicly traded partnership engaged principally in the business of gathering  transporting  storing and distributing crude oil in california and the rocky mountain region 
we completed our initial public offering of common units on july  we operate primarily in california  colorado  montana  wyoming and utah and conduct our business through two regional operating units west coast operations and rocky mountain operations 
we generate revenue principally through three crude oil and other dark products related activities pipeline transportation services  storage and distribution services  and buying  gathering  blending and selling activities 
our west coast operations consist of line  the line system  the pacific terminals storage and distribution system and the pmt gathering and blending system 
we transport crude oil produced in california s san joaquin valley and the california outer continental shelf to third party refineries and terminal facilities in the los angeles basin and in bakersfield 
we also provide crude oil and other dark products storage and distribution services to third party refineries and terminal facilities in the los angeles basin 
we have recently announced that we are proceeding with the next phase of development of our pier marine import terminal project in the port of los angeles  as described below 
in addition  in our west coast operations  we purchase  gather  blend and resell crude oil  in large measure as a means of generating additional volumes on our pipelines 
our rocky mountain operations consist of the western corridor system  the salt lake city core system  the arepi pipeline and rpl s interest in frontier pipeline 
we transport crude oil produced in canada and the rocky mountain region for delivery to refineries in montana  wyoming  colorado and utah 
our pipelines deliver crude oil to refineries by direct connection or indirectly through connections with third party pipelines 
we recently announced that we have entered into an acquisition agreement and a non binding letter of intent to extend our rocky mountain pipeline network into alberta  canada as described below 
cash distributions our principal business objective is to generate stable and increasing cash flows by being a leading provider of pipeline transportation and other midstream services to the north american energy industry 
we seek to achieve our objective by executing the following strategies use our strategic position in our core market areas to maximize throughput on our pipelines and utilization of our storage facilities 
control our operating and capital costs while maintaining the safety and operational integrity of our assets 
minimize our exposure to commodity price volatility 
pursue strategic and accretive acquisitions and new projects that enhance and expand our core business 
our ability to execute this acquisition and development strategy successfully is dependent on the price we pay for the acquisitions or the cost of development relative to the assets future cash flows 
our cash distributions to unitholders may vary over time with the cash flow from our operating activities  which are impacted by the revenue and cost variables described below 
our cash distributions may also vary over time with the level of sustaining capital expenditures 
these expenditures are required to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity or efficiency of our assets and extend their useful lives 
during the subordination period  the common units are entitled to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of per unit  plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters  to the extent we have sufficient cash from our operations after payment of fees and expenses  including payments to our general partner and establishment of cash reserves  before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units 
the purpose of the subordinated units is to increase the likelihood that during the subordination period there will be available cash to be distributed on the common units 
see item market price of and distributions on the registrant s common equity and related unitholder matters regarding subordinated units and the subordination period 
key events in and recent developments the key events in were the closing of the million eptc acquisition by pt on july  and the related equity offering which raised million of net proceeds 
the financial data for includes the financial position and results of operations associated with five months of ownership of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system 
this acquisition supported a per unit  or  increase to a per unit annual distribution rate 
in february  we entered into a definitive share purchase and sale agreement to acquire the rangeland pipeline system from bp canada energy company  and we entered into a non binding letter of intent to purchase the mid alberta pipeline mapl assets  also in alberta  from imperial oil resources 
the acquisition price for the rangeland pipeline system is million canadian plus an estimated million canadian for line fill  working capital  transaction costs and transition capital expenditures 
at an exchange rate of us canadian  as of march   the total purchase price would be approximately us million 
closing of the transaction is expected in the second quarter of  following receipt of regulatory approvals and fulfillment of other customary closing conditions 
the mapl transaction is subject to completion of a definitive purchase and sale agreement  receipt of regulatory approvals and fulfillment of such other closing conditions as are included in the definitive agreement 
see items and business and properties rocky mountain operations 
we expect to fund the canadian acquisitions with borrowings under a new revolving credit facility being negotiated and with the proceeds from the issuance of additional common units so as to maintain an approximate percent debt to total capitalization ratio 
the final key event was completion of the feasibility study for pier marine import terminal project in the port of los angeles  and  in early  the entering into a project development agreement with subsidiaries of valero energy corporation and the commencement of environmental review for permitting purposes

business fundamentals pipeline transportation we generate pipeline transportation revenue by charging tariff rates for transporting crude oil on our pipelines 
the fundamental items impacting our pipeline transportation revenue are the volume of crude oil  or throughput  we transport on our pipelines and our tariff rates 
throughput on our pipelines fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil available for transport on our pipelines  the demand for refined products  refinery downtime and the availability of alternate sources of crude oil for the refineries we serve 
our shippers determine the amount of crude oil we transport on our pipelines  but we influence these volumes through the level and type of service we provide and the rates we charge 
our rates need to be competitive to transportation alternatives  which are mostly other pipelines 
the availability of crude oil for transportation on our pipelines is dependent in part on the amount of drilling and enhanced recovery activity in the production fields we serve in our west coast operations and in parts of our rocky mountain systems 
with the passage of time  production of crude oil in an individual well naturally declines  which can in the short term be offset in whole or in part by additional drilling or the implementation of recovery enhancement measures 
in the san joaquin valley  california and in the california outer continental shelf ocs  production is generally declining 
the expected development of the rocky point field in the ocs and  if it occurs  the closure of the shell bakersfield refinery  will  we believe  provide an increase in the supply of crude oil available to be transported by us to the los angeles basin  offsetting some or all of the effects of production decline in the short term 
in addition  we acquired the pacific terminals storage and distribution assets and are developing the pier project to participate in the marine import business  which is growing as a result of local production decline 
in the rocky mountains  our pipelines are connected to canadian sources of crude oil  and we recently announced an agreement and a non binding letter of intent to acquire two pipeline systems to access significant supplies of canadian crude oil and synthetic crude oil which we expect will replace any rocky mountain production decline and meet growing demand in the rocky mountain region

the tariff rates we charge on line and the line system are regulated by the california public utilities commission the cpuc 
tariffs on line are established based on market considerations  subject to certain contractual restraints 
tariffs on line  which are cost of service based tariffs  are based upon the costs to operate and maintain the pipeline  as well as charges for the depreciation of the capital investment in the pipeline and the authorized rate of return 
the tariff rates charged on our rocky mountain pipelines are regulated by either the ferc or the wyoming public service commission generally under a cost of service approach 
storage and distribution we provide storage and distribution services to refineries in the los angeles basin 
the fundamental items impacting our storage and distribution revenue are the amount of storage capacity we have under lease  the lease rates for that capacity and the length of each lease 
demand for crude oil storage capacity tends to be more stable over time and leases for crude oil storage capacity are usually long term more than one year 
demand for other dark products storage capacity is less stable than for crude oil storage and varies depending on  among other things  refinery production runs and maintenance activities 
leases for other dark products storage capacity are usually short term less that one year 
one of our business goals is to convert a number of other dark products tanks to more flexible crude oil service which can also accommodate other dark products 
while pt s rates are regulated by the cpuc  the cpuc has authorized pt to establish its rates based on market conditions through negotiated contracts 
gathering and blending we purchase  gather  blend and resell crude oil in our pmt operations 
our pmt gathering and blending system in california s san joaquin valley is a proprietary intrastate operation  not regulated by the cpuc or the ferc  a business that is complementary to our west coast pipeline transportation business 
the gathering network effectively extends our pipeline network to capture additional supplies of crude oil for transportation to los angeles 
the contribution of our pmt gathering and blending operations is  for several reasons  a variable part of our income 
first  it varies with the price differential between the cost of the varying grades of crude oil and natural gasoline it buys to blend and the price of the blended crude oil it sells 
costs and sales prices are impacted by crude oil prices generally  as well as local supply and demand forces  including regulations affecting refined product specifications 
second  it varies with the price differential between crude oil purchased on one price basis and sold on a different price basis 
finally  it varies with the volumes gathered and blended 
we control these activities through our risk management policy  which provides specific guidelines for our crude oil marketing and hedging activities and requires oversight by our senior management 
acquisitions and new projects we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions and new projects for development of additional midstream assets  including pipeline and storage and terminal facilities that are accretive to our cash flow and complement our existing business 
we expect to fund acquisitions and new projects with a combination of debt and additional partnership units  including common units 
we expect to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately percent over time 
operating expense a substantial portion of the operating expenses we incur  including the cost of field and support personnel  maintenance  control systems  telecommunications  rights of way and insurance  varies little with changes in throughput 
certain of our costs  however  do vary with throughput  the most material being the cost of power used to run the various pump stations along our pipelines 
major maintenance costs can vary with age and also with regulation requiring inspections at defined intervals 
unanticipated costs can include the costs of cleanup of any oil spills to the extent not covered by insurance 
employees the partnership does not have any employees 
all our personnel are employed by our general partner 
our general partner does not conduct any business other than with respect to the partnership 
all expenses incurred by our general partner are charged to us

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
such estimates and judgments are evaluated and modified as necessary on an ongoing basis 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note  significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements and estimates  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity we routinely apply the provisions of purchase accounting when recording our acquisitions 
application of purchase accounting requires that we estimate the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the valuation of the fair value of the assets involves a number of judgments and estimates 
in our major acquisitions to date  we have engaged an outside valuation firm to provide us with an appraisal report  which we utilize in determining the purchase price allocation 
the allocation of the purchase price to different asset classes impacts the depreciation expense we subsequently record 
the principal assets we have acquired to date are property  pipelines  storage tanks and equipment 
we depreciate the components of our property and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated 
when necessary  the assets useful lives are revised and the impact on depreciation is treated on a prospective basis 
we accrue an estimate of the undiscounted costs of environmental remediation for work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated it is probable that cleanup costs are or will be required and may be reasonably estimated 
in making these estimates  we consider information that is currently available  existing technology  enacted laws and regulations  and our estimates of the timing of the required remedial actions 
we use outside environmental consultants to assist us in making these estimates 
in addition  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america require us to establish liabilities for the costs of asset retirement obligations when the retirement date is determinable 
we will record such liabilities only when such date is determinable 
from time to time  a shipper or group of shippers may initiate a regulatory proceeding or other action challenging the tariffs we charge or have charged 
in such cases  we assess the proceeding on an ongoing basis as to its likely outcome and as to the dollar amounts involved in order to determine whether to accrue for a future expense 
we use outside regulatory lawyers and financial experts to assist us in these assessments 
our inventory of displacement oil  pipeline linefill and minimum tank volumes is carried in our accounts at the lower of cost and market value 
this inventory is held for our long term use and for the operation of our pipelines and storage facilities and as such is recorded in our property and equipment balance 
as oil prices tend to be cyclical  we are exposed to the potential for a write down to market value 
such a write down would be a non cash expense but would not be realized  if at all  until we were to sell such inventory for a price less than our cost 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary year ended december  change percent in thousands net income    basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit for was and per limited partner unit  respectively 
we completed our initial public offering in july  so there is no comparable per unit calculation for net income for includes five months of operations of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system following the acquisition of these assets on july  net income for includes the results of the western corridor and salt lake city core system assets for the ten months following the acquisition of these assets on march  the additional income generated by the pacific terminals storage and distribution system assets and the western corridor and salt lake city core systems was more than offset by a combination of lower west coast pipeline volumes and increased expenses 
the increased expenses include increased general and administrative expense associated with our growth and becoming a public company in july  and increased interest expense associated with our post ipo capital structure 
segment information year ended december  west coast change percent in thousands operating income    operating data pipeline throughput bpd the increase in west coast operating income was primarily due to the acquisition of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in pipeline transportation revenue as average daily pipeline throughput decreased to  barrels per day for the year ended december   compared to  barrels per day for the prior year 
california ocs throughput to the los angeles basin was lower during  compared to  primarily due to maintenance downtime at both on shore processing and off shore production facilities 
refinery maintenance activities and increased mid barrel crude oil mbco demand in san francisco reduced throughput to the los angeles basin 
increased demand for light crude oil at refineries in bakersfield also reduced throughput to the los angeles basin 
in addition  the natural decline of ocs and san joaquin valley production reduced available crude supplies 
year ended december  rocky mountains change percent in thousands operating income   operating data bpd salt lake city core system western corridor system arepi pipeline frontier pipeline operating income for the period included only ten months of results for the western corridor and salt lake city core systems 
the partnership incurred significant transition costs in the period  but those costs were largely eliminated in the period 
the reduction in transition costs in was offset  however  by increased maintenance expense 
refinery maintenance in the first half of resulted in reduced throughput to salt lake city through our various pipeline systems 
statement of income discussion and analysis year ended december  change percent in thousands pipeline transportation revenue    rocky mountain pipeline transportation revenue increased by million compared to the corresponding period in due to revenue generated by the western corridor and salt lake city core systems for twelve months in compared to ten months in the increase in rocky mountain pipeline transportation revenue for was more than offset by a decrease in west coast pipeline transportation revenue due to lower throughput 
year ended december  change percent in thousands storage and distribution revenue   the acquisition of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system resulted in storage and distribution revenue of million for the period ended december  year ended december  change percent in thousands crude oil sales    crude oil purchases    crude oil sales  net of purchases   the increase in crude oil sales and purchases for was primarily the result of higher crude oil prices 
we consider this activity to be complementary to our pipeline transportation operations 
year ended december  change percent in thousands operating expenses    the increase in operating expense was related primarily to the acquisitions of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system and a full year of operations of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems 
we are also experiencing higher operating costs as a result of increased requirements for pipeline and storage tank inspections  and increased costs for property taxes and insurance 
operating expense for our rocky mountain operations increased by million due to a full year of operations of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems compared to ten months of operations for the corresponding period in and a return to a normal level of maintenance activity 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of million in transition cost savings 
operating expense for our west coast operations increased by million 
for  we incurred five months of operating expense relating to the pacific terminals storage and distribution system 
operating expense for our west coast pipeline and gathering and blending operations decreased due to lower field operating expenses and reduced right of way expense resulting from the relinquishment of certain unused rights of way on line year ended december  change percent in thousands transition costs   transition costs in consisted only of employee transition bonus payments  whereas transition costs in consisted of payments to the seller of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems for certain interim operations support  financial systems services and employee transition bonuses 
year ended december  change percent in thousands general and administrative expense    this increase includes million of expense for long term incentive awards made in december and in the balance of the increase is attributable to additional costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems and higher costs of being a public company  including costs incurred as a result of new stock exchange and sec rules 
year ended december  change percent in thousands depreciation and amortization    the increase in depreciation and amortization includes million for a full year of depreciation on the western corridor and salt lake city core systems in  compared to ten months in  and million for five months of depreciation on the pacific terminals storage and distribution system 
year ended december  change percent in thousands share of net income loss of frontier income before rate case and litigation expense   rate case and litigation expense   share of net income loss of frontier   our decreased share of frontier net income was attributable to expenses for a contract dispute and two tariff rate related matters 
these matters relate to early and prior years  so there is no impact on frontier s current rates or revenues 
year ended december  change percent in thousands interest expense    million of the increase in interest expense was attributable to an increase in borrowings during the period to finance the acquisition of the pacific terminals storage and distribution system 
the remaining increase was primarily due to an increase in the interest rate on outstanding borrowings during our interest rate on outstanding borrowings averaged for  as compared to during  reflecting our interest rate swap agreements  in which we fixed the interest rates on million of our post initial public offering debt 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  summary year ended december  change percent in thousands net income    this increase was due to the acquisition of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems  higher volumes and tariffs on line and the line system  and a full year of operation and improved results from our pmt gathering and blending system 
segment information year ended december  west coast change percent in thousands operating income    operating data pipeline throughput bpd this increase was primarily due to a full year of operation and improved results of the pmt gathering and blending system and improved west coast pipeline revenues as a result of increased long haul throughput volumes and higher average tariff rates in the strong refinery demand in the los angeles basin  coupled with the absence of any significant production or refinery outages  accounted for the increased volumes in year ended december  rocky mountains change percent in thousands operating income    operating data bpd salt lake city core system western corridor system arepi pipeline frontier pipeline the increase in operating income was primarily due to the acquisition of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems 
additionally  operating income was higher due to reduced rate case and litigation expense in statement of income discussion and analysis year ended december  change percent in thousands pipeline transportation revenue    this increase was primarily due to our rocky mountain operations  where revenue increased by million due to revenue generated by the western corridor and salt lake city core systems 
in addition  pipeline transportation revenue from our west coast operations increased by million 
the west coast pipeline transportation revenue increase was due to the increase in long haul throughput volumes of approximately  bpd  or  and an increase in average tariff rates 
the strong refinery demand for crude oil by the los angeles basin refiners and the absence of any significant refinery or production outages in our delivery market account for the increased volumes compared to this increase in west coast revenue was partially offset by million attributable to the elimination of pipeline transportation revenue that was previously charged to the seller of the pmt gathering and blending system as a third party during the first six months of year ended december  change percent in thousands crude oil sales    crude oil purchases    crude oil sales  net of purchases    on july   we acquired the pmt gathering and blending system 
we consider this activity to be complementary to our pipeline transportation operations 
the increase in crude oil sales net of purchases is attributed to a full year of operations in as compared to six months in year ended december  change percent in thousands operating expense    the increase in operating expense related primarily to our rocky mountain operations  where operating expenses increased by million  principally as a result of the acquisition in of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems 
operating expenses for our west coast operations increased million due primarily to field operating  blending and trucking expenses related to our pmt gathering and blending system acquired in mid year ended december  change percent in thousands general and administrative expense    the general and administrative expense increase was due in part to the acquisition of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems  and a full year of pmt reflected in operations 
in addition  we incurred an additional million  approximately  in g a expenses in as a result of the transition from a private company to a publicly traded company and to comply with new sec and stock exchange regulations 
year ended december  change percent in thousands depreciation and amortization expense    the increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily attributed to million of depreciation expense related to the acquisition of the western corridor and salt lake city core systems on march  year ended december  change percent in thousands share of net income of frontier income before rate case and litigation expense   rate case and litigation expense share of net income of frontier   this decrease was due to lower tariff revenue  which was partially offset by the increase in our ownership interest from to in december  and rate case and litigation expense 
year ended december  change percent in thousands interest expense    increased interest expense of million was due to an increase in the average daily debt balances  which were million in as compared to million in the interest rate on outstanding borrowings in averaged compared to in liquidity and capital resources in the last three years  we have satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and from our credit facilities 
we believe that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated sustaining capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments in the next three years 
we intend to finance the recently announced canadian acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under a new million canadian revolving credit facility equivalent to approximately us million based on the exchange rate on march  that is currently being negotiated and the proposed issuance of additional common units 
the final structure of the acquisition financing will depend on market conditions existing prior to the completion of the acquisitions 
the financing plan for our proposed pier project is under development  but will likely include both proceeds from debt and the issuance of additional units 
the final structure of the pre construction and construction financing will depend on market conditions 
we expect to fund future acquisitions and new projects with the proceeds of borrowings under our existing and planned revolving credit facilities and the issuance of additional units  including common units 
we expect to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately percent over time 
on august   the partnership  peg and certain subsidiaries of peg filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the sec to register the issuance and sale  from time to time and in such amounts as determined by the market conditions and needs of the partnership  of up to million of common units of the partnership and debt securities of both the partnership and peg 
the sec declared the registration statement effective on august  at december   we have approximately million of remaining availability under this registration statement 
we intend to draw down on this shelf registration statement to finance a portion of our future acquisitions and development projects  including the canadian acquisitions and the pier project 
our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations  fund planned capital expenditures  make acquisitions  develop projects and pay distributions to our unitholders will depend upon our future operating performance 
our operating performance is primarily dependent on crude oil transported through our pipelines and capacity leased in our storage tanks as described in overview above 
our operating performance is also affected by prevailing economic conditions in the crude oil industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  which could significantly impact future results

these interest rate swap agreements are described further in note summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
contractual obligations in the performance of our operations  we are bound by certain contractual obligations 
following is a summary of our monetary contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt principal repayments    right of way obligations     operating lease obligations    total      right of way obligations reflect our commitment for the next years assuming the current right of way agreements will be renewed during the period 
long term debt principal repayments we expect to refinance the debt maturities in the year and more than year categories above through an extension of existing credit facilities  new credit facilities and or through the issuance of bonds or long term notes 
right of way obligations we have secured various rights of way for our pipeline systems under right of way agreements  certain of which expire at various times through  that provide for annual payments to third parties for access and the right to use their properties 
due to the nature of our operations  we expect to continue making payments and renewing the right of way agreements indefinitely 
the annual amounts payable under certain of the right of way agreements are subject to fair market and inflation adjustments 
right of way payments  which are included in operating expenses  were million  million and million in  and  respectively

for a description of certain operating leases please see note leases to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   or environmental matters our transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation under federal  state and local environmental laws concerning  among other things  the generation  handling  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials  and we may be  from time to time  subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions 
the accompanying balance sheet includes reserves for environmental costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations 
estimates of ultimate liabilities associated with environmental costs are particularly difficult to make with certainty due to the number of variables involved  including the early stage of investigation at certain sites  the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation at most locations  the number of remediation alternatives available  the uncertainty of potential recoveries from third parties and the evolving nature of environmental laws and regulations 
based on the information presently available  it is the opinion of management that our environmental costs  to the extent they exceed recorded liabilities  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and crude oil price risk 
debt we incur under our credit facilities will bear variable interest at either the applicable base rate or a rate based on libor 
we have used and will continue to use certain derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates 
we use  on a limited basis  certain derivative instruments principally futures and options to hedge our minimal exposure to market price volatility related to our inventory or future sales of crude oil 
we do not enter into speculative derivative activities of any kind 
derivative instruments are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
although we generally do not own the crude oil that we transport in our pipelines  in our pmt operations we purchase crude oil for subsequent blending  transportation and resale primarily in the los angeles basin 
changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments related to crude oil inventory are recognized in net income 
in and  crude oil sales  net of purchases were net of and million respectively  reflecting changes in the fair value of pmt s derivative instruments for its marketing activities 
in addition  changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments related to the future sale of crude oil are deferred and reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of partners capital  until the related revenue is reflected in the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   million relating to the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments was included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in august and september  peg entered into three interest rate swap agreements pursuant to which it executed five interest rate swap transactions that mature in  totaling million  and two interest rate swap transactions that mature in  totaling million 
the partnership designated these swaps as a hedge of its exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to the libor interest payments due on million outstanding under peg s term loan 
the average swap rate on this million of debt is approximately  resulting in an all in interest rate on the million of debt of approximately including the current applicable margin of 
as of december   interest rates  as measured by current market quotations for the future periods covered by the interest rate swap agreements  had declined as compared to august and september  when peg entered into these interest rate swap agreements 
this decline resulted in an unrealized loss of million on the aggregate interest rate hedge  which is recorded as a liability at december  the million liability is shown on the consolidated balance sheet in two components  a current liability of million  and a long term liability of million 
the unrealized loss reflecting the decline in interest rates from the inception of the swaps  is shown in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of partners capital  and not in the consolidated income statement 
should interest rates remain unchanged from the december  market quotations for these future periods  actual losses realized on the interest rate swap agreements in each of the future periods would be offset by the benefit of lower floating rates in those periods  such that total net interest expense on the million of hedged debt would be fixed at the all in interest rate of approximately we are subject to risks resulting from interest rate fluctuations as the interest cost on the remaining million outstanding under our term loan and million outstanding under our revolving credit facility is based on variable rates 
if the libor rate were to increase in as compared to the rate at december   our interest expense for would increase million based on the outstanding debt at december   which has not been hedged
