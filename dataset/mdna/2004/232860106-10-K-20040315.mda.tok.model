management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included in this annual report 
we have attempted to identify the most important matters on which our management focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and the short term and long term opportunities  challenges and risks including material trends and uncertainties which we face 
we also discuss the actions we are taking to address these opportunities  challenges and risks 
the overview is not intended as a summary of  or a substitute for review of  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
for comparative purposes  certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the reclassifications had no impact on net income 
monetary amounts presented in the following discussion are in thousands  except per share amounts 

table of contents business segments including the operations of conestoga acquired in may  we have operated as a rural local telephone company providing integrated communications services to residential and business customers in markets throughout the eastern half of pennsylvania 
we operate an incumbent rural local exchange carrier  or rlec  in parts of berks  lancaster  union and smaller portions of five other adjacent counties in pennsylvania  and a competitive local telephone company  or clec  in the lancaster  harrisburg  reading  altoona  pottstown  state college and williamsport  pennsylvania metropolitan areas  which we refer to as our edge out markets 
we offer our customers a comprehensive package of communications services including local and long distance telephone services  high speed data  internet access and video services 
we also provide business customers with integrated voice and data network solutions 
our segments  excluding our d e wireless and paging services  which are reported as discontinued segments  are rlec  clec  internet services  systems integration and conestoga wireless 
the measure of profitability for our segments is operating income since individual segment managers are not responsible for such items as interest and taxes that are reported below operating income 
as of december   we served  rlec access lines   clec access lines   dial up internet access subscribers   digital subscriber lines dsl and web hosting customers 
for the year ended december   we generated total revenues of  and operating income of  our principal business segments are our rlec  clec  internet services and systems integration segments 
the measure of segment results used by management is operating profit 
historically  we have derived a majority of our revenues from the regulated rlec segments 
the rlec segment accounts for approximately of total revenues and substantially all of our operating income 
the decrease in rlec access lines experienced in and is significant  as access lines have traditionally been monitored as an important measure of rlec performance 
our total rlec lines decreased by in and an additional in these decreases were primarily due to the fact that  as customers have migrated to broadband services  such as dsl and wireless services  the demand for second lines has somewhat diminished 
however  we find it noteworthy that  despite the decrease in rlec access lines  our rlec revenues have increased slightly as a result of an increase in enhanced services and dedicated lines and circuits 
the fact that we have succeeded in adding internet service customers at a substantial rate over the past three years demonstrates that our customers are willing to pay more for advanced services 
we believe the opportunity to provide such services is an important component of our business plan 
our rlec revenue is derived primarily from network access charges  local telephone service  enhanced telephone services and regional toll service 
network access revenue consists of charges paid by long distance and wireless companies for access to our network in connection with the completion of long distance telephone calls 
local telephone service revenue consists of charges for local telephone services  including monthly charges for basic local service 
enhanced telephone services revenue is derived from providing special calling features  such as caller id  call waiting and privacy call manager  a telemarketer call blocking service 
regional long distance revenue is derived from providing regional long distance services to our rlec customers 
our clec revenue is derived primarily from network access charges  local telephone service  enhanced telephone services and long distance service revenue 
network access revenue consists of charges paid by long distance companies and other telecommunications carriers customers for access to our network in connection with the completion of long distance telephone calls 
local telephone service revenue consists of charges for local telephone services  including monthly charges for basic local service 
enhanced telephone services revenue is derived from providing special calling features  such as caller id  call waiting and a telemarketer call blocking service 
long distance revenue consists of charges for both national and regional long distance services  a portion of which is provided on a resale basis 

table of contents our internet services revenue is derived from dial up and high speed internet access services  in addition to web hosting services 
we market these services primarily in our rlec and clec service areas 
our systems integration revenue is derived from sales of services that support the design  implementation and maintenance of local and wide area networks and telecommunications systems 
in addition  we sell data and voice communications equipment and provide custom computer programming service 
we market these products and services primarily in our rlec and clec service areas  as well as the eastern pennsylvania and greater philadelphia market areas 
conestoga wireless revenue is derived from providing wireless personal communication service  including local and long distance telephone services  and from the sale of wireless communications equipment 
we marketed these products and services in certain of our rlec and clec markets until this segment was sold in january our operating costs and expenses primarily include wages and related employee benefit costs  depreciation and amortization  selling and advertising  software and information system services and general and administrative expenses 
our rlec segment incurs costs related to network access charges  directory expense  and other operations expenses such as digital electronic switch expense  engineering and testing costs 
our clec incurs costs related to leased network facilities associated with providing local telephone service to customers  engineering costs  and network access costs for local calls and long distance expense 
our internet services segment incurs leased network facilities costs for our dial up internet service and for our dsl internet service 
our systems integration business incurs expenses primarily related to wages and employee benefit costs  and equipment and materials used in the course of the installation and provision of our products and services 
our conestoga wireless segment incurred costs related to network facilities to provide wireless personal communications service  engineering costs  network access costs and costs of wireless communications equipment sold 
we incur access line related capital expenditures associated with access line additions  expenditures for upgrading existing facilities and costs related to the provision of dsl and dial up internet services in our rlec and clec territories 
we believe that our capital expenditures related to clec access line growth are generally associated with additional customers and therefore tend to result in incremental revenue 
we believe that our additional capital expenditures relating to our investment in software and systems will provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace and generally allow for corresponding reductions in operating expenses 
business strategy our primary business objective is to be a leading  regional wireline focused integrated communications service provider 
to achieve this objective  we will continue to pursue the following goals we will continue to operate under a disciplined strategy to increase our market share in our edge out markets by offering competitive communication service packages primarily to business customers 
we will continue to leverage our modern network infrastructure  established reputation  extensive local knowledge and significant operating experience to attempt to gain new customers and increase our market share in our edge out markets 
we will endeavor to be a single source provider of voice and data communications services to our business customers 
we believe that the convergence and complexity of voice communications and data network technologies has increased the need for businesses to seek a single provider for all of their communications and data networking needs 
our systems integration business enhances our service offerings  and we believe bundling of video  dsl and voice is a key part of the strategy to grow revenue and strengthen customer relationships while providing increased value 
we will make efforts to further expand our market share of the internet services market by meeting or exceeding the customer service and technical requirements of individual and business customers whom we believe have been underserved by national providers of internet services in the past 
while we intend to maintain our dial up internet access customer base  we also plan to leverage our success and further focus our sales and marketing efforts on selling our high speed data and web hosting services 
we will offer a broad array of enhanced telephone services to our customers that improve our general customer experience  thereby helping to retain customers 

table of contents we will continue to make our commitment to customer service a top priority 
customer service  provided hours a day  days a week and days a year  strengthens our relationships with our customers and enhances our competitive position 
completing the final integration of systems and procedures with conestoga will help to ensure that we continue to deliver excellent service 
we will endeavor to increase the scale and scope of our business through acquisitions of companies  including other rlecs that strategically fit with our integrated communications strategy 
acquisition targets may include companies that deepen our industry focus  broaden service territories and increase the breadth of our services 
business risks our primary business risks include the external threat of increased competition in the telecommunications industry and the internal risk of our debt financing  which was primarily incurred in connection with the acquisition of conestoga in risk of increased competition it is basic policy of the fcc and the pennsylvania public utility commission to encourage competition in the communications industry 
the limited suspension that we held until january from certain interconnection requirements of ta has been discontinued 
this development means that we could be required to allow competitors to have access to our customers by our competitors seeking the removal of our rural exemption  entering our territory and using our services and facilities through interconnection agreements to provide local services 
the convergence of voice and data communication technologies is dramatically changing the communications industry 
for several years  telephone and cable companies have been able to provide data transmission  with telephone companies having the advantage in voice and cable companies having the advantage in video 
technology may be eliminating those advantages 
the further development of voip has reduced voice communication to a packet data transmission process  which will place the cable companies in a competitive situation with the telephone companies 
furthermore  there is not consistent regulation of voip offerings at this time  placing voip at a possible regulatory advantage over telephone services 
to maintain our voice business  we may in the future have to offer voip over our network system 
we are now able to offer video over our fiber copper system that is fully capable of competing with the video services offered by the cable companies 
to make the competitive picture even more complex  wireless offerings in voice and data are becoming more capable and competitive  and it appears technology has been developed that will enable electric power transmission lines to compete in the communications industry 
in the future  service offerings of telephone  cable and electric companies in voice  data and video may be similar  while wireless is a significant provider in voice and data 
all of these developments will result in a highly competitive environment in which four types of companies are very likely to be in direct competition with each other in many locations 
this development could cause the telephone companies to lose their competitive edge in their territories and could result in significant inroads into their business 
the competitive threat posed by the convergence of technologies makes our commitment to customer service even more critical to the protection of our competitive position 
we are a local company with local connections that can give individual personalized service 
we are also small enough to be able to provide an individual response to customer services needs 
we feel that this responsiveness will be critical to our future well being 
it may be a challenge to successfully convince both our business and residential customers to see us as their preferred provider of integrated communications services  particularly in light of the substantially greater resources of many of our competitors 
the foregoing opportunities and risks require management to attempt to balance several aspects of our business 
our relatively stable rlec business segment provides cash flow both to pursue our business plan to evolve a leading  regional wireline focused integrated communications service provider and to provide a current return on investment to our shareholders in the form of our regular dividend 
however  since our resources are limited and the manner in which the communications industry will develop is uncertain  both in terms of technology and competition  we will not be able to pursue every possible avenue of development and critical decisions will need to be made at various stages of our evolution as a company 
these decisions can be made more difficult by our desire to balance our short term goals of maintaining our rlec business segment and dividend return and our long term goal of providing voice  data and video services 
maintaining 
table of contents our dividend payout may be challenging due to the need to invest in our future and restrictions under our financing facilities  both in the form of an annual limitation of  in dividends and the requirement to remain in compliance with financial covenants 
risk of debt financing we have recently refinanced our indebtedness 
the effect of the refinancing was to lower the interest rates on our indebtedness  provide greater flexibility in our financial covenants and spread out the amortization of principal 
the refinancing also lifts restrictions on the expansion of our clec edge out market and eliminates the requirement of the prior loan agreement that excess cash flow be applied to prepayments of principal 
this new structure  pursued to manage our balance sheet in order to better pursue our business plan  decreases the risks associated with our indebtedness 
however  our indebtedness of approximately  as of december  could restrict our operations because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the level of indebtedness will make us more vulnerable to economic or industry down turns  and our debt service obligations increase our vulnerability to competitive pressures  as we may be more leveraged than many of our competitors 

table of contents results of operations the measure of segment results used by management is operating profit

also  in  there was an increase of  in realized gains losses 
table of contents on the disposition of investments available for sale  a reduction in expenses from reduced equity losses in affiliates  and other miscellaneous income increases 
this reduction was offset by the  increase in interest expense related to larger borrowings for the full twelve months 
overview of compared to consolidated operating revenues from continuing operations in increased  or  to  in from  in the revenue increase was primarily due to the inclusion of conestoga s revenues  totaling approximately  for the balance of the year after the may  acquisition of conestoga by d e 
the former d e operating divisions realized increased revenue primarily from increases in their customer bases in the clec and internet services segments  offset by decreased service and product sales revenues in the systems integration segment 
before corporate eliminations  the former d e segment s clec revenues increased  or  internet services revenue increased  or due to an increase in new customers  and d e systems integration segment s revenues decreased  or due to slower sales from a weak economy

the conestoga rlecs experienced similar trends that resulted largely from regulatory policy of decreasing network access charges and offsetting them by higher local telephone service charges in order to more accurately reflect actual costs 
the other revenue increase in from is attributable to the inclusion of conestoga for seven months after the acquisition 
d e other revenue increased in compared to as a result of increases in directory revenue  custom calling features  repair services and rent  offset by a long distance revenue decrease 
local telephone revenues are anticipated to increase as the result of rate increases and sales of local dedicated circuits offsetting the effect of continued line count erosion 
network access revenues are likely to decrease slightly due to a decline in minutes of use and a reduction in state access rates as regulatory trends move toward transferring cost to the local telephone end user 
other revenues  which include enhanced services  directory advertising and other miscellaneous services are likely to continue the trend of steady increases  while we expect an offset from long distance 
rlec segment operating expenses increased  or  to  in and  or  to  in these increases were primarily attributable to including twelve months in of conestoga operating expenses and seven months since the acquisition in operating income increased  or  in to  and increased  or  in to  the synergies resulting from the conestoga acquisition  including staff reductions and other cost savings have contributed to the improved profitability in  but are not likely to result in similar increases in operating income in future years

clec segment operating expenses increased  or  to  in and  or  to  in these increases were partially attributable to including twelve months in of conestoga operating expenses and seven months since the acquisition in and due to increased costs of services related to an increase in our customer base 
the increase in was also partially attributable to the expansion of our fiber optic network and the migration of many of our clec customers onto our own facilities 
this expansion includes expenses for engineering design and network administration 
operating losses decreased  or  to  in and increased  or  to  in primarily due to changes in operating efficiencies as the customer base grew 
operating results are expected to continue to improve as more customers are added to cover the fixed costs of operations and as we expand the number of customers completely on our own network 
during we eliminated  business lines from the count for all three years presented to conform the method of counting clec lines to the same method used by the rlec

sfas provides guidance on impairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets 
upon the adoption of sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are no longer subject to amortization 
as of january   the results of the first step indicated no potential impairment of d e s goodwill 
in  the company completed its annual impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balances of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
effects of inflation it is the opinion of management that the effects of inflation on operating expenses over the past three years have been immaterial and have been partially offset by growth in operating and other revenues 
management anticipates that this trend will continue in financial condition liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated significant cash from our operating activities 
our overall capital resource strategy is to finance capital expenditures for new and existing lines of businesses and acquisitions partly with operating cash and through external sources  such as bank borrowings and offerings of debt or equity securities 
net cash provided by continuing operations was  in cash provided by continuing operations has increased from  in and  in in the increase is partially related to the five additional months of conestoga operations included compared to the seven months included after the acquisition 
improved operating results relating to the operating efficiencies of the combined company have contributed to improved cash generated by continuing operating activities 
additional cash flow from seven months of the conestoga acquisition was the primary reason for the increase 
heightened competition in the telecommunications industry could affect future cash flows related to continuing operations

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  income taxes  revenues  contingencies and impairment of long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  as further described below 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of all significant accounting policies that we follow in the preparation of our financial statements 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies as those that are the most significant to our financial statement presentation and that require difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition revenue for all of our business segments is recorded when services are provided or products are delivered  when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our rlec and clec pricing is subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions 
such regulation also covers services  competition and other public policy issues 
different interpretations by regulatory bodies may result in adjustments in future periods to revenues derived from our rlec and clec operations 
we monitor these proceedings closely and make adjustments to revenue accordingly 
we receive a portion of our interstate access revenues in our rlec segments from settlement pools in which we participate with other telephone companies through the national exchange carrier association  inc neca 
these pools were established at the direction of the fcc and are funded by interstate access service revenues  which the fcc regulates 
revenues earned through this pooling process are initially recognized based on estimates and are subject to adjustments that may either increase or decrease the amount of interstate access revenues 
if the actual amounts that we receive from the settlement pools differ from the amounts that we have recorded as accounts receivables on our balance sheets  we are required to record the amount of such a reduction or increase as an adjustment to our earnings 
until december  we did not experience significant adjustments to our revenues as a result of our participation in these pools 
in december  we recorded an increase in communications service revenue of as a result of a change in our estimated interstate revenue earned from the neca pooling process 
we revised our estimate  based on a recent decision rendered by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  which reaffirmed a fcc rule that mandates that refunds payable to long distance communication providers are not required for periods in which interstate rate of return revenues exceed fcc authorized levels if the rates for those periods were deemed to be lawful rates 
neca s access rates  in which our rlecs concur  were filed and approved consistent with the fcc s deemed lawful rules 

table of contents regulated asset depreciation we use a composite group remaining life method and straight line composite rates to depreciate the regulated property assets of our rlec and clec segments 
under this method  when we replace or retire such assets  we deduct the net book value of these assets and charge it to accumulated depreciation 
the effect of this accounting is to amortize any gains or losses on dispositions over the service lives of the remaining regulated telephone property assets rather than recognizing such gain or loss in the period of retirement 
in addition  use of the composite group remaining life method requires that we periodically revise our depreciation rates 
such revisions are based on asset retirement activity  and often require that we make related estimates and assumptions 
if actual outcomes differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to adjust depreciation and amortization expense  which could impact our earnings 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including our property  plant and equipment and our finite lived intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability is assessed based on future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment loss  if indicated  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
while we have never recorded a material impairment charge for long lived assets  future events or changes in circumstances could result in a material charge to earnings 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are no longer subject to amortization 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by comparing carrying value to fair value 
there is a two step process for goodwill 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting units to their carrying value 
if the results of the first step of the impairment testing indicate a potential impairment  the second step would be completed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balances of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the sum of the expected future cash flows derived from such goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses  the market price of our stock and other factors 
while we have never recorded a material impairment charge for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  future events or changes in circumstances could result in a material charge to earnings 
investment in unconsolidated affiliates we have investments and advances to affiliated entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
we periodically evaluate whether there have been declines in value in these investments  and if so  whether these declines are considered temporary or other than temporary 
other than temporary declines would be recognized as realized losses in earnings 
evidence of a loss in value includes  but is not limited to  our inability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment 
the fair value of an investment that is less than its book value may indicate a loss in value of the investment 
our evaluations are based on many factors  including the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than carrying amount  the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow factors  and our intent and ability to hold the investment  including strategic factors 
retirement benefits retirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be settled in the future 
retirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service 
table of contents period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by a company 
we record the costs of providing retirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
in december  we adopted sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  which provides expanded disclosures related to our employee benefit plans 
our estimates include assumptions regarding the discount rate to value the future obligation and the expected return on our plan assets 
we use discount rates in line with current market interest rates on high quality fixed rate debt securities 
our return on assets is based on our current expectation of the long term returns on assets held by the plan 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligations  funding requirements and periodic benefit costs that we incur 
our pension expense for would have increased approximately if our assumed investment return were one quarter of a percent lower 
the expense would have increased approximately if our assumed discount rate were one quarter of a percent lower or decreased if our assumed discount rate were one quarter of a percent higher 
income taxes we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
we have two categories of income taxes current and deferred 
current taxes are those amounts we expect to pay when we file our tax returns 
since we must report some of our revenues and expenses differently for our financial statements than we do for income tax purposes  we record the tax effects of those differences as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are currently in effect 
management s judgment is required in determining the provision for current income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset that we may not be able to use in the preparation and filing of our future tax returns 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets

 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
this statement establishes common accounting practices relating to legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal operation of a long lived asset 
sfas requires that companies recognize the fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations in the period in which the legal obligations are incurred and capitalize that amount as a part of the book value of the long lived asset 
that cost is then depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying long lived asset 
d e adopted sfas effective january  and recorded an after tax benefit of as a cumulative effect accounting adjustment in the first quarter the adjustment represents the cumulative estimate of cost of removal charged to depreciation expense in earlier years for which d e does not have a legal obligation associated with the retirement of the related tangible long lived assets 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies how to identify variable interest entities vies and how a company should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate the entity 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   in which a company obtains an interest after that date 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  a revision to fasb interpretation no 
which among other things  defers the effective date of implementation for certain entities 
the revised interpretation is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march   with the exception of special purpose entities for which the statement is effective for periods ending after december  fin r requires the consolidation of entities which are determined to be vies when the reporting company determines that it will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  receive a majority of the vies residual returns  or both 
an entity is considered to be a vie when its capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or its equity investors lack the characteristics of having a controlling financial interest 
d e is currently evaluating the impact of fin r related to its ownership interests in eurotel and pilicka  to assess the effects on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in january  the emerging issues task force issued eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf primarily addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  it addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying eitf  separate contracts with the same entity or related parties that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated as a package and should  therefore  be evaluated as a single arrangement in considering whether there are one or more units of accounting 
that presumption may be overcome if there is sufficient evidence to the contrary 
eitf also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the provisions of eitf are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s 
we are highly leveraged and  as a result  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
our debt obligations are us dollar denominated 
our market risk  therefore  is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and changes in our leverage ratio which may increase the margin added to the interest rate as provided in our loan agreement 
as of december   our debt can be categorized as follows in thousands fixed interest rates secured term loans subject to interest rate fluctuations senior secured revolving credit facility senior secured term loans 
table of contents as part of our loan covenant conditions  we have arranged interest rate protection on one half of the total amount of senior indebtedness outstanding  with a weighted average life of at least years 
as of december   our bank debt is as follows principal average rate fair value rates fixed for two years through interest rate swaps rates fixed for three years through interest rate swaps rates fixed for four years through interest rate swaps fixed rate debt  rates fixed for twelve years total fixed rates of total debt variable rate debt of total debt if interest rates rise above the rates of the variable debt  we could realize other income of  for each basis points above the fixed rates 
if rates were to decline  we would realize other expense of approximately  for each basis point decrease in rates 
the interest rate swaps were arranged to hedge against the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
the swaps were arranged with three banks that participate in our senior indebtedness 
under these interest rate swap contracts  we agree to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in turn an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the notional amounts of the contracts are not exchanged 
net interest positions are settled quarterly 
terms of swaps notional amounts average pay rate average received rate fair value to to to if interest rates rise above the rates fixed by these swaps  we could realize other income of  for each basis points above the fixed rates 
if rates were to decline  we would realize other expense of approximately  for each basis point decrease in rates 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments having initial maturities of three months or less 
while these investments are subject to a degree of interest rate risk  it is not considered to be material
