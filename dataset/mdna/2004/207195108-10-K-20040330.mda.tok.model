item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in item of this annual report on form k 
results of operations the company s business is cyclical and is affected by the same economic factors that affect the remodeling and housing industries in general  including the availability of credit  consumer confidence  changes in interest rates  market demand and general economic conditions 
in addition to external economic factors  the company s results are sensitive to sales and manufacturing volume  competitors pricing  consumer preferences for flooring products  raw material costs and the mix of products sold 
the manufacturing process is capital intensive and requires substantial investment in facilities and equipment 
the cost of operating these facilities generally does not vary in direct proportion to production volume and  consequently  operating results fluctuate disproportionately with changes in sales volume 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey case no 
seeking relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  as a means to resolve claims asserted against it related to the use of asbestos in its products decades ago 
during  congoleum obtained the asbestos personal injury claimant votes necessary for approval of a proposed pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization  and  in january  filed its pre packaged plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the court 
the bankruptcy court has not yet scheduled a hearing to consider approval of the proposed plan 
congoleum is also involved in litigation with certain insurance carriers related to disputed insurance coverage for asbestos related liabilities  and certain insurance carriers have filed various objections to congoleum s plan of reorganization and related matters 
the pre packaged plan  if confirmed  would leave non asbestos creditors unimpaired and would resolve all pending and future asbestos claims against the company 
the plan of reorganization would provide for  among other things  an assignment of certain rights in  and proceeds of  congoleum s applicable insurance to a trust that would fund the settlement of all pending and future asbestos claims and protect the company from future asbestos related litigation by channeling all asbestos claims to the trust under section g of the bankruptcy code 
other creditors would be unimpaired under the plan 
the bankruptcy court has authorized the company to pay trade creditors in the ordinary course of business 
the company expects that it will take most of to obtain confirmation of its plan 
based on its pre packaged bankruptcy strategy  the company has made provision in its financial statements for the minimum amount of the range of estimates for its contribution and costs to effect its plan to settle asbestos liabilities through a plan trust established under section g of the bankruptcy code 
the company recorded charges of million in the fourth quarter of and an additional million in the fourth quarter of to provide for the estimated minimum costs of completing its reorganization 
actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust and costs for pursuing and implementing the plan of reorganization could be materially higher if the company is not successful in obtaining confirmation of the pre packaged plan of reorganization in a timely manner 
the maximum amount potentially available to settle asbestos liabilities is the going concern or liquidation value of the company 
for more information regarding the company s asbestos liability and plan for resolving that liability  please refer to notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
in addition  please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect future results the company has significant asbestos liability and funding exposure  and its proposed pre packaged plan of reorganization may not be confirmed for a discussion of certain factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s goals for resolving its asbestos liability through the proposed plan of reorganization 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease resulted primarily from lower sales in the do it yourself tile category coupled with continued weakness in the manufactured housing market 
improved resilient sheet volume  particularly in base grade and trade up builder products  coupled with a price increase and lower sales allowances  helped to partially mitigate the sales decline 
gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for the year ended december  gross margins improved slightly as improved pricing  manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction programs helped offset raw material cost increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses for and included million and million of cost associated with asbestos related claims  respectively 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  cost savings initiatives were implemented that helped offset increases in pension  medical and other related costs 
the company recorded a charge of million during the fourth quarter of  included in selling  general  and administrative expenses  to increase its recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims 
the recorded liability at december  represents the minimum estimated cost that the company will incur to resolve its asbestos related liability through the execution of the company s proposed plan of reorganization 
if the company is not successful in obtaining confirmation of its proposed plan of reorganization in a timely manner  actual costs could be significantly higher 
the proposed plan also would require the company to make an additional contribution to the plan trust one year after confirmation of the plan equal to of any increase in the market value of the company s shares at that time over their value on june  no provision has been made for the cost of this possible additional contribution  which could be material 
the company will adjust its recorded liability should its estimates change 
the loss from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december   an improvement of million 
this smaller loss from operations was primarily due to the lower asbestos related charge  offset by lower gross margin dollars 
interest income declined from million in to million in due to lower average cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  reflecting increased borrowings under the revolver 
the company recorded a tax benefit of million on a loss before income taxes of million in as a result of utilizing certain loss carry forwards that had previously been fully reserved 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase resulted primarily from strong sales of the durastone product line  which was introduced in august  and improved resilient sheet sales in both the base grade and trade up builder segment  partially offset by lower luxury and contract tile sales 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of sales  compared to million in  or of sales  an increase of million over the year ended december  gross profit margins declined slightly as costs of expanding sales and the product mix impact of increased base grade builder product sales offset improved manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   which includes asbestos related costs of million  as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to the asbestos related charge  significant investments in additional displays and samples to support the durastone product line and higher promotional support contributed to the increase 
the company recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of  included in selling  general and administrative expenses  to adjust its recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims against it 
the recorded liability at december  represented the then minimum estimated cost that the company would incur to resolve its asbestos related liability through a plan of reorganization 
loss from operations was million for the year ended december   compared to income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this change was primarily due to the asbestos charge 
interest income declined from million in to million in due to a combination of lower average cash equivalent and short term investment balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  due to lower capitalized interest in compared to the company recorded a tax provision of thousand on a loss before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting change of million in the tax provision included a benefit from the reduction of thousand for a tax valuation allowance as a result of utilizing certain loss carry forwards that had previously been fully reserved 
this benefit was offset by an additional provision for valuation allowance 
for  the effective tax rate was  resulting in a tax benefit of thousand which included a reduction for a tax valuation allowance of thousand 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but rather will be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
sfas no 
was effective for the company as of january  during the first quarter of  the company performed a transitional impairment test of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
and concluded that there was impairment 
the company compared the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill and it was determined that based on the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities  there should be no goodwill recorded 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment loss of million during the first quarter of  which has been recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded other comprehensive expense of million relating to the recognition of a minimum pension liability 
the company reduced its assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets from to and its discount rate from to 
liquidity and capital resources the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
as described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern unless it obtains relief from its substantial asbestos liabilities through a successful reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the company is a defendant in a large number of asbestos related lawsuits and on december  filed a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve this liability 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this annual report on form k 
these matters will have a material adverse impact on liquidity and capital resources 
during  the company paid million in defense and indemnity costs related to asbestos related claims and million in fees and expenses related to implementation of its planned reorganization under chapter and litigation with certain insurance companies 
congoleum expects to spend a further million at a minimum in fees  expenses  and trust contributions in connection with obtaining confirmation of its plan 
the company also expects to recover million from the collateral trust or its successor pursuant to terms of the claimant agreement and related documents which provide for the trust to reimburse certain expenses of the company 
timing of such recovery will depend on when the trust receives funds from insurance settlements or other sources 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments at december   were million  a decrease of million from december  under the terms of its revolving credit agreement  payments on the company s accounts receivable are deposited in an account assigned by the company to its lender and the funds in that account are used by the lender to pay down any loan balance 
restricted cash represents funds deposited in this account but not immediately applied to the loan balance 
working capital was million at december   down from million one year earlier 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was to one  compared to to one a year earlier 
the ratio of debt to total capital at december  was 
compared to 
at december  net cash used by operations during the year ended december  was million  as compared to cash provided by operations of million in cash from operations decreased from to as funds were used to reduce accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by lower inventories and accounts receivables 
expenditures related to asbestos liabilities and the company s reorganization plan were million in  compared to million in  accounting for slightly more than half the decrease 
the remainder of the decrease was primarily due to a low level of manufacturing and shipment activity at the end of  combined with creditors managing their pre petition credit exposure  and the company prepaying certain expenses  prior to its december  chapter filing 
these accounts are not expected to remain at the unusually low levels experienced at the end of capital expenditures in totaled million 
the company is currently planning capital expenditures of approximately million in and between and million in in january  the bankruptcy court authorized entry of a final order approving congoleum s debtor in possession financing  which replaced its pre petition credit facility on substantially similar terms 
the debtor in possession financing provides a one year revolving credit facility with borrowings up to million 
interest is based on 
above the prime rate 
this financing agreement contains certain covenants which include the maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth and ebitda 
it also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and limitations on capital expenditures 
the covenants and conditions under this financial agreement must be met in order for the company to borrow from the facility 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  borrowings under this facility are collateralized by inventory and receivables 
at december   based on the level of receivables and inventory  million  was available under the facility  of which million was utilized for outstanding letters of credit and million was utilized by the revolving loan 
the company anticipates that its debtor in possession financing facility will be replaced with a revolving credit facility on substantially similar terms upon confirmation of its plan of reorganization 
while the company expects the facilities discussed above will provide it with sufficient liquidity  there can be no assurances that it will continue to be in compliance with the required covenants  that the company will be able to obtain a similar or sufficient facility upon exit from bankruptcy  or that the debtor in possession facility would be renewed if the company s plan of reorganization is not confirmed by that facility s expiration on december  in addition to the provision for asbestos litigation discussed previously  the company has also recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities other than asbestos related claims  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against the company 
among these claims  the company is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites more fully discussed in legal proceedings in part i  item and environmental regulation in part i  item 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites and certain of the company s owned and previously owned facilities 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
the exact amount of such future cost and timing of payments are indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of the company s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties  and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
the company has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known general and environmental contingencies 
while the company believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  and that they will be paid over a period of five to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from the company s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on the company s costs  the company is not aware of any pending legislation which would reasonably have such an effect 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along to its customers 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other non current assets 
the outcome of these environmental matters could result in significant expenses incurred by or judgments assessed against the company 
the company s principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its financing agreement 
although the company did not generate cash from operations in as more fully discussed above  the company anticipates that it will generate cash from operations in the company believes these sources will be adequate to fund working capital requirements  debt service payments  planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  and its current estimates for costs to settle and resolve its asbestos liabilities through its pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization 
the company s inability to obtain confirmation of the proposed plan in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to fund its operating  investing and financing requirements 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations for future principal payments on its debt and future minimum rental payments on its non cancelable operating leases at december  the company does not have payment obligations under capital leases or long term purchase contracts 
payments due by period amounts in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt   operating leases      total      critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies upon which its financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
asbestos liabilities as discussed in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products 
during  congoleum obtained the asbestos personal injury claimant votes necessary for approval of a proposed pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization  and  in january  filed its pre packaged plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the court 
the bankruptcy court has not yet scheduled a hearing to consider approval of the proposed plan 
congoleum is also involved in litigation with certain insurance carriers related to disputed insurance coverage for asbestos related liabilities  and certain insurance carriers have filed various objections to congoleum s plan of reorganization and related matters 
the company s estimated minimum gross liability to cover settlements of current asbestos claims is million  which is substantially in excess of both the total assets of the company as well as the company s previous estimates made in prior periods of the maximum liability for both known and unasserted claims 
while the company purchased insurance coverage it believes applies to these claims  some of the insurance carriers are presently insolvent and the remaining solvent insurance carriers have disputed their coverage obligations 
the company believes the ultimate amount of its liability  and the amount of recoverable insurance  will be determined through some combination of negotiation  litigation  and bankruptcy court order  but that these amounts can no longer be reasonably estimated given all the uncertainties that presently exist 
the company expects that insurance will provide the vast majority of the recovery available to claimants  due to the amount of insurance coverage it purchased and the comparatively limited resources and value of the company itself 
the company believes that it does not have the necessary financial resources to litigate and or settle asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business 
in light of its bankruptcy filing and proposed plan of reorganization  the company believes the most meaningful measure of its probable loss due to asbestos litigation is the amount it will have to contribute to the plan trust plus the costs to effect the reorganization 
the company estimates the minimum remaining costs to complete the reorganization process to be million  which it has recorded as a current liability 
the company also expects to recover million from the collateral trust or its successor pursuant to terms of the claimant agreement and related documents which provide for the trust to reimburse certain expenses of the company 
timing of such recovery will depend on when the trust receives funds from insurance settlements or other sources 
the maximum amount of the range of possible asbestos loss is limited to the going concern or liquidation value of the company  an amount which the company believes is substantially less than the minimum estimated liability for the known claims against it 
the company will update its estimates  if appropriate  as additional information becomes available during the reorganization process  resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the lifo last in  first out method of determining cost is used for substantially all inventories 
the company records as a charge to cost of goods sold any amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventories to the net realizable sales value 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company provides for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  the company makes certain assumptions as to future events such as the ability to generate future taxable income 
at december   the company has provided a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets 
environmental contingencies as discussed previously  the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
management has recorded both liabilities and insurance receivables in its financial statements for its estimate of costs and insurance recoveries for future remediation activities 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the extent of cleanup activities to be performed  the methods employed in the cleanup activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and these assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that the company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
pension plans and post retirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company uses a calculated value of the expected return on plan assets which is further described below 
under sfas no 
 the effects of the actual performance of the pension plan s assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on the company s computation of pension income or expense are amortized over future periods 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
for  the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in determining pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains or losses million at will ultimately be recognized as an adjustment to future pension expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
the company accounts for its post retirement benefits other than pensions in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on a actuarial basis 
these amounts are projected based on the january  sfas no 
valuation and the year end disclosure assumptions  including a discount rate of and health care cost trend rates of in reducing to an ultimate rate of in risk factors that may affect future results the company has significant asbestos liability and funding exposure  and its proposed pre packaged plan of reorganization may not be confirmed 
as more fully set forth in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report  the company has significant liability and funding exposure for asbestos claims 
the company has entered into settlement agreements with various asbestos claimants totaling million 
satisfaction of this obligation pursuant to the terms of the pre packaged plan is dependent on a determination by the bankruptcy court that the plan has satisfied certain criteria under the bankruptcy code  among other things 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining confirmation of its pre packaged plan in a timely manner or at all  and any alternative plan of reorganization pursued by the company or confirmed by the bankruptcy court could vary significantly from the description in this report including descriptions incorporated by reference in this report 
furthermore  the estimated costs and contributions to effect the contemplated plan of reorganization or an alternative plan could be significantly greater than currently estimated 
any plan of reorganization pursued by the company will be subject to numerous conditions  approvals and other requirements  including bankruptcy court approvals  and there can be no assurance that such conditions  approvals and other requirements will be satisfied or obtained 
some additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s goals for resolving its asbestos liability through the prepackaged plan of reorganization bankruptcy filing include i the future cost and timing of estimated asbestos liabilities and payments and availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement from insurance companies  which underwrote the applicable insurance policies for the company for asbestos related claims and other costs relating to the execution and implementation of any plan of reorganization pursued by the company  ii timely reaching agreement with other creditors  or classes of creditors  that exist or may emerge  iii satisfaction of the conditions and obligations under the company s outstanding debt instruments  iv the response from time to time of the company s and its controlling shareholder s  american biltrite inc s  lenders  customers  suppliers and other constituencies to the ongoing process arising from the company s strategy to settle its asbestos liability  v the company s ability to maintain debtor in possession financing sufficient to provide it with funding that may be needed during the pendency of its chapter case and to obtain exit financing sufficient to provide it with funding that may be needed for its operations after emerging from the bankruptcy process  in each case  on reasonable terms  vi timely obtaining sufficient creditor and court approval of any reorganization plan pursued by it  vii developments in and the outcome of insurance coverage litigation pending in new jersey state court involving congoleum  abi  and certain insurers  and viii compliance with the bankruptcy code  including section g 
in any event  if the company is not successful in obtaining sufficient creditor and court approval of its pre packaged plan of reorganization  such failure would have a material adverse effect upon its business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  there has been federal legislation proposed that  if adopted  would establish a national trust to provide compensation to victims of asbestos related injuries and channel all current and future asbestos related personal injury claims to that trust 
due to the uncertainties involved with the pending legislation  the company does not know what effects any such legislation  if adopted  may have upon its business  results of operations or financial condition  or upon any plan of reorganization it may decide to pursue 
to date  the company has expended significant amounts pursuant to resolving its asbestos liability relating to its proposed prepackaged chapter plan of reorganization 
to the extent any federal legislation is enacted  which does not credit the company for amounts paid by the company pursuant to its plan of reorganization or requires the company to pay significant amounts to any national trust or otherwise  such legislation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of the company s significant liability and funding exposure for asbestos claims  there can be no assurance that if it were to incur any unforecasted or unexpected liability or disruption to its business or operations it would be able to withstand that liability or disruption and continue as an operating company 
for further information regarding the company s asbestos liability  insurance coverage and strategy to resolve its asbestos liability  please see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report 
the company may incur substantial liability for environmental  product and general liability claims in addition to asbestos related claims  and its insurance coverage and its likely recoverable insurance proceeds may be substantially less than the liability incurred by the company for these claims 
environmental liabilities 
due to the nature of the company s business and certain of the substances which are or have been used  produced or discharged by the company  the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  disposal  handling  emission  transportation and discharge into the environment of hazardous substances 
the company has historically expended substantial amounts for compliance with existing environmental laws or regulations  including environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
the company will continue to be required to expend amounts in the future for costs related to prior activities at its facilities and third party sites  and for ongoing costs to comply with existing environmental laws  such amounts may be substantial 
there is no certainty that these amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition because  as a result of environmental requirements becoming increasingly strict  the company is unable to determine the ultimate cost of compliance with environmental laws and enforcement policies 
moreover  in addition to potentially having to pay substantial amounts for compliance  future environmental laws or regulations may require or cause the company to modify or curtail its operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
product and general liabilities 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company becomes involved in lawsuits  administrative proceedings  product liability claims in addition to asbestos related claims and other matters 
in some of these proceedings  plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts and the matters may remain unresolved for several years 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition if the company is unable to successfully defend against or settle these matters  its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy unfavorable judgments or settlements relating to these matters  or the company is unable to collect insurance proceeds relating to these matters 
the company is dependent upon a continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers and would be harmed if there were a significant  prolonged disruption in supply or increase in its raw material costs 
the company s business is dependent upon a continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers 
the principal raw materials used by the company in its manufacture of sheet and tile flooring are vinyl resins  plasticizers  latex  limestone  stabilizers  cellulose paper fibers  urethane and transfer print paper 
the company purchases most of these raw materials from multiple sources 
although the company has generally not had difficulty in obtaining its requirements for these materials  it has occasionally experienced significant price increases for some of these materials 
the company believes that suitable alternative suppliers are available for substantially all of its raw material requirements 
however  the company does not have readily available alternative sources of supply for specific designs of transfer print paper  which are produced utilizing print cylinders engraved to the company s specifications 
although no loss of this source of supply is anticipated  replacement could take a considerable period of time and interrupt production of some of the company s products 
in an attempt to protect against this risk of loss of supply  the company maintains a raw material inventory and continually seeks to develop new sources which will provide continuity of supply for its raw material requirements 
however  there is no certainty that the company s maintenance of its raw material inventory or its ongoing efforts to develop new sources of supply would be successful in avoiding a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition if it were to realize an extended interruption in the supply of its raw materials 
in addition  the company could incur significant increases in the costs of its raw materials 
although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in the costs of its raw materials to its customers  the company s ability to do so is  to a large extent  dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase  competitive pressures and market conditions for its products 
there have been in the past  and may be in the future  periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered 
during those periods of time  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company operates in a highly competitive flooring industry and some of its competitors have greater resources and broader distribution channels than the company 
the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the company encounters competition from three other manufacturers in north america and  to a much lesser extent  foreign manufacturers 
some of the company s competitors have greater financial and other resources and access to capital than the company 
furthermore  like the company  one of the company s major competitors has sought protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
when such competitor emerges from bankruptcy as a continuing operating company it may have shed much of its pre filing liabilities and have a competitive cost advantage over the company as a result of having shed those liabilities 
in addition  in order to maintain its competitive position  the company may need to make substantial investments in its business  including its product development  manufacturing facilities  distribution network and sales and marketing activities 
competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the company s products and in the loss of the company s market share for its products 
moreover  due to the competitive nature of the company s industry  the company may be commercially restricted from raising or even maintaining the sales prices of its products  which could result in the company incurring significant operating losses if its expenses were to increase or otherwise represent an increased percentage of the company s sales 
the company s business is subject to general economic conditions and conditions specific to the remodeling and housing industries 
the company is subject to the effects of general economic conditions 
a sustained general economic slowdown could have serious negative consequences for the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the company s business is cyclical and is affected by the economic factors that affect the remodeling and housing industries in general and the manufactured housing industry specifically  including the availability of credit  consumer confidence  changes in interest rates  market demand and general economic conditions 
the company could realize shipment delays  depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from unexpected disruptions of operations at any of the company s facilities 
the company s business depends upon its ability to timely manufacture and deliver products that meet the needs of its customers and the end users of the company s products 
if the company were to realize an unexpected  significant and prolonged disruption of its operations at any of its facilities  including disruptions in its manufacturing operations  it could result in shipment delays of its products  depletion of its inventory as a result of reduced production and increased production costs as a result of taking actions in an attempt to cure the disruption or carry on its business while the disruption remains 
any resulting delay  depletion or increased production cost could result in increased costs  lower revenues and damaged customer and product end user relations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company offers limited warranties on its products which could result in the company incurring significant costs as a result of warranty claims 
the company offers a limited warranty on all of its products against manufacturing defects 
in addition  as a part of its efforts to differentiate mid and high end products through color  design and other attributes  the company offers enhanced warranties with respect to wear  moisture discoloration and other performance characteristics which generally increase with the price of such products 
if the company were to incur a significant number of warranty claims  the resulting warranty costs could be substantial 
the company is heavily dependent upon its distributors to sell the company s products and the loss of a major distributor of the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company currently sells its products through approximately distributors providing approximately distribution points in the united states and canada  as well as directly to a limited number of mass market retailers 
the company considers its distribution network very important to maintaining its competitive position 
although the company has more than one distributor in some of its distribution territories and actively manages its credit exposure to its distributors  the loss of a major distributor could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company derives a significant percentage of its sales from two of its distributors  lasalle bristol corporation and mohawk industries  inc lasalle bristol corporation serves as the company s distributor in the manufactured housing market  and mohawk industries  inc serves as a retail market distributor of the company 
these two distributors accounted for of the company s net sales for the twelve months ended december  and of the company s net sales for the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in prevailing market interest rates affecting the return on its investments but does not consider this risk exposure to be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company invests primarily in highly liquid debt instruments with strong credit ratings and short term less than one year maturities
